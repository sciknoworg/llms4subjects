            "abstract": "\"Journalists have often been considered the \"fourth emergency service\", first on the scene, alongside paramedics, fire and police, running towards danger rather than away, and providing independent, veritable and crucial information in the public interest. And yet, unlike frontline workers, little, if any, counselling or training is offered to journalists on how to deal with the horrors they witness, the trauma they absorb from being at the forefront of human suffering, and limited, to no training is given to student journalists on how to prepare themselves for trauma, be it from war scenes to the everyday \"death knock\". New research is demonstrating a rise in post-traumatic stress disorder amongst journalists for the \"everyday\" trauma they encounter and a noticeable increase, or reluctance from new journalists, to undertake emotionally distressing assignments. Editors in industry are now calling for educators to invest in curricula that centre around understanding how to cope with the distress and trauma, and why work like this is vital to facilitate the work journalists do hold power to account. This book investigates the cause and effect of trauma reporting on the journalist themselves and provides a toolkit for training journalists and practitioners to build resilience and prepare themselves for trauma. It draws on national and international experiences enabling readers to gain valuable insight into a range of contemporary issues and the contexts in which they may work. This edited book offers a blend of academic research studies, evidence-based practitioner interviews, and teaching resources drawing on the experiences of journalists and academics nationally and internationally\"--",

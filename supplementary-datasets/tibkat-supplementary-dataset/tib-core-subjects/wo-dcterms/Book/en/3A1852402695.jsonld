            "abstract": "\"This book provides a concise introduction to the latest research in the fundraising and nonprofit marketing field. It details the foundational studies in the area, reviews current controversies, outlines the main theories and models of fundraising and presents suggestions for future research. This second edition, as well as providing an update on recent significant contributions to the fundraising and nonprofit marketing domain, contains additional material on crowdfunding, the effects of disintermediation of charity giving, the consequences for fundraising of the Covid pandemic, public perceptions of the role of administrative expenditure by nonprofits, the influence of donors' levels of trust in charities, and disaster relief fundraising. The text guides the reader through the myriad of nonprofit marketing and fundraising research, summarises key findings and current thinking on fundraising strategies and processes, and offers conceptual insights into emerging themes. It highlights the studies that have the greatest contemporary importance and identifies gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed via further research. Thus, the book provides an invaluable introduction to the literature on fundraising and nonprofit marketing and a convenient reference for students, for beginning researchers, and for more experienced academics and practitioners with interests in the nonprofit and fundraising field\"--",

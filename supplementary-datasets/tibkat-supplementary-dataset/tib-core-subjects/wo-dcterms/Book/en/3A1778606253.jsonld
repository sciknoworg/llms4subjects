            "abstract": "his collection of essays by one of medieval studies\u2019 most brilliant historians argues that the analysis and critique of biopower, as conventionally defined by Michel Foucault and then widely assumed in much contemporary theory of sovereignty, is a sovereign mode of temporalization caught up in the very time-machine it ostensibly seeks to expose and dismantle.  For Michel Foucault, biopower (epitomized in his maxim \u201cto make live and to let die\u201d) is the defining sign of the modern, and he famously argued that the task of political philosophy was to cut off the head of the classical (premodern) sovereign, the one \u201cwho made die and let live.\u201d Entrapped by his supersessionary thinking on the question, Foucault argued that the maxim of \u201cto make live and let die\u201d of modern sovereignty superseded a premodern sovereignty characterized by the contrasting power \u201cto make die and let live.\u201d  The essays collected in Biddick\u2019s book (some reprinted and some published here for the first time) argue that Foucault spoke too soon about the supposed \u201cthen\u201d of the classical sovereign and the modern \u201cnow,\u201d and this became painfully apparent in his analysis of Nazism in his later lectures, Society Must be Defended. There Foucault groped to articulate an anguishing paradox: How could it be that the Nazis, as the ultimate biopolitical sovereign machine, would insist on an archaic (premodern) mode of sovereignty in their death camps? Here is how he posed the question in that lecture: \u201cHow can the power of death, the function of death, be exercised in a political system centered upon biopower?\u201d Foucault left this question hanging",

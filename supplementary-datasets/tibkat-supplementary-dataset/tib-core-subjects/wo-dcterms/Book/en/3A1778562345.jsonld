            "abstract": "This book is a result of contributions of experts from international scientific community working in different aspects of shape memory alloys (SMAs) and reports on the state-of-the-art research and development findings on this topic through original and innovative research studies. Through its five chapters, the reader will have access to works related to ferromagnetic SMAs, while it introduces some specific applications like development of faster SMA actuators and application of nanostructural SMAs in medical devices. The book contains up-to-date publications of leading experts, and the edition is intended to furnish valuable recent information to the professionals involved in shape memory alloys analysis and applications. The text is addressed not only to researchers but also to professional engineers, students, and other experts in a variety of disciplines, both academic and industrial, seeking to gain a better understanding of what has been done in the field recently and what kind of open problems are in this area",

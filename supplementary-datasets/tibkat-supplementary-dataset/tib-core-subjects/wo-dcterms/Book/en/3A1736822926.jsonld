            "abstract": "\"Nanocellulose, a unique and promising natural material extracted from native cellulose, has received immense interest for its broad spectrum of applications owing to its remarkable physical properties, special surface chemistry, and excellent biological properties (biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity). In attempts to meet the requirements of humanity's wellbeing, biomaterials scientists taking advantage of the structure and properties of nanocellulose aim to develop new and formerly non-existing materials with novel and multifunctional properties. This book highlights the importance of nanocellulose and overviews its synthesis, types, structure, and properties. Further, it discusses various biofabrication approaches and applications of nanocellulose-based biomaterials in various fields such as environment, biomedical, optoelectronics, pharmaceutics, paper, renewable energy, and food industry. Devised to have a broad appeal, this book will be useful to beginners, who will appreciate its comprehensive approach, as well as active researchers, who will find its focus on recent advancements highly valuable\"--",

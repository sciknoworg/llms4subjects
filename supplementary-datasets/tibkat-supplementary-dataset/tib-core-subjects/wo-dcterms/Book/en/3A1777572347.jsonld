            "abstract": "\"This new edition presents an enhanced perspective for the innovative concept of Total Manufacturing Assurance (TMA) and the holistic means by which such assurance can be attained. In fulfilling this objective, this textbook discusses the management and engineering techniques and tools, and their practical implementation, required to achieve TMA. Using a holistic approach to manufacturing operations, Total Manufacturing Assurance: Controlling Product Quality, Reliability, and Safety, focuses on analytics and performance assessment along with Industry 4.0 and the role it plays in advanced manufacturing. The textbook covers strategic planning, innovation, and engineering economics, as well as the manufacturing process, materials, and operations. Product manufacturing system reliability, maintainability, availability, quality, and safety along with financial issues in decision making and engineering analysis are all captured in this new edition. Students at undergraduate and graduate levels studying engineering management, mechanical, industrial, and manufacturing engineering, as well as business students will find this new edition an invaluable instructional resource. At the same time, working professionals including management, engineers, and others that are intimately involved in the manufacturing system sector will also find this textbook very useful in their day-to-day work. PowerPoint slides and a solutions manual are available to instructors for qualified course adoptions\"--",

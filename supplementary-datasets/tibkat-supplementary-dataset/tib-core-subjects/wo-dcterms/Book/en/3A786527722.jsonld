            "abstract": "\"A road map for Indian companies who want to do business in China for almost every large Indian company, China has become mission critical as a market, a supplier, a source of low cost capital, a platform for global advantage, a partner, and a competitor. However, for most Indian executives, their understanding of China is rooted largely in myths. As a result, many Indian executives tend to assume either \"if we can succeed in India, we can surely succeed in China\" or \"China is so different, there's no way we can make any headway there.\" This much-needed book provides an action-oriented resource for Indian companies to address the challenges and capture the opportunities that China represents. Building on the central premise that succeeding in China is neither impossible nor a cakewalk, this book is based on real-life case studies of several Indian companies who have been successful in China, including Tata Consulting Services, Tata Motors' Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary, Mahindra & Mahindra, NIIT, Sundaram Fasteners and others.  Offers a timely guide for Indian companies that want to tap into the multi-faceted opportunities offered by China  filled with case studies of several Indian companies that have made successful inroads in the Chinese marketplace.  Authors are among the most respected and well-known experts on China and India.  This book is a must-have guide for Indian companies that want to expand into the global marketplace\"--",

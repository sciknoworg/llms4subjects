            "abstract": "The subject of this thesis is a computational linguistic model of Meaning Constitution in linguistic units. Taking the phenomenon of variability of linguistic meaning as its starting point, Meaning Constitution is described as an information-processing step, which is then implemented and empirically tested in a series of linguistic experiments. In this thesis, Meaning Constitution is understood as a dynamic process in which the meaning of linguistic units only becomes concrete within local contexts in relation to their general meaning potential. This dynamic concept of meaning is based on a central assumption of Cognitive Semantics, according to which meanings do not exist independently of the context. The motivation for the implementation of a computational linguistic model of its own is the fact that the conception of meaning in Cognitive Semantics itself does not involve such an operationalisation \u2013 which, strictly speaking, means that it must be regarded as not falsifiable",

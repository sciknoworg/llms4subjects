            "abstract": "Despite many initiatives that were introduced beginning in 1990, Uruguay had had trouble implementing a national policy to introduce ICT in schools, especially in primary education. However, in 2006, a new initiative 'Plan Ceibal' was announced to provide laptops for all students and teachers in government- supported primary schools over a three-year period. Plan Ceibal had three pillars: (1) equity, social inclusion and equality in access to technology; (2) technology as a means to achieve these goals; and (3) education, universal law that aims to equal opportunities. The implementation phase of the Plan Ceibal was carried out in four stages, including a pilot phase that began in early 2007, As a result of the initial phases of Plan Ceibal, all of these primary schools (with subsequent stages of the project focusing on all secondary schools, teachers, students and their families) had the opportunity to use and learn with ICTs",

This book defines the new field of \"Bioeconomy\" as the sustainable and innovative use of biomass and biological knowledge to provide food, feed, industrial products, bioenergy and ecological services. The chapters highlight the importance of bioeconomy-related concepts in public, scientific, and political discourse. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the authors outline the dimensions of the bioeconomy as a means of achieving sustainability. The authors are ideally situated to elaborate on the diverse aspects of the bioeconomy. They have acquired in-depth experience of interdisciplinary research through the university\u2019s focus on \u201cBioeconomy\u201d, its contribution to the Bioeconomy Research Program of the federal state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and its participation in the German Bioeconomy Council. With the number of bioeconomy-related projects at European universities rising, this book will provide graduate students and researchers with background information on the bioeconomy. It will familiarize scientific readers with bioeconomy-related terms and give scientific background for economists, agronomists and natural scientists alike. ; Broadens your understanding of a sustainable economy Simplifies multidisciplinary approaches for the transition to a Bioeconomy Combining principles from agriculture, biotechnology and macroeconomics",

            "abstract": "Green chemistry for environmental sustainability is an interdisciplinary science that seeks to reduce environmental problems and establish global sustainability. Given the recent development of energy-efficient technologies and the synthesis of green materials, research shows that green chemistry can be a powerful candidate for future technologies. This book discusses synthesis, catalysis, nanosynthesis, green processes, energy-efficient materials, biodegradable raw materials, and comprehensive environmental remediation, making it an excellent resource for aspiring researchers. This book explains what developments are taking place in green chemistry, why it is needed, what new methods can be used to break down traditional barriers, and how researchers can integrate them into their traditional research. To overcome barriers and achieve global environmental sustainability, this book focuses on a three-tiered strategy, namely, pollution and accident Prevention, safety and security Assurance, and energy and resource Sustainability (P-A-S). This book is also an excellent resource for environmental and sustainability managers to integrate new synthetic materials or technologies based on the principle of green chemistry into their traditional work. Ultimately, this book is aimed not only at academics or scientists but also at professionals without geopolitical boundaries",

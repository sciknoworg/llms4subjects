            "abstract": "We look at green supply chain management from the vantage point of the triple bottom line: environmental, economic, and social. There are many sustainability decisions that can be made on which we have an incredible impact. Usually, managers have the opportunity to make decisions in five areas of the supply chain: plan, source, make, deliver, and return. Nowadays, consumers care more about where and how the products are produced and delivered, what they are made of, and who made them. Regulatory bodies are continuously creating pressure on firms to adopt eco-friendly practices in their businesses for better environmental sustainability. As a result, firms have just two choices: to adopt green and/or eco-friendly practices in their supply chain operations to fulfill their customers' and regulatory bodies' requirement or not to adopt green practices and lose their business position and potential customers",

            "abstract": "This publication includes 82 technical papers presented at Rocscience International Conference (RIC) 2021, held online on April 20 and 21, 2021. Rocscience created this event to bring geotechnical academics, researchers and practitioners together to exchange ideas as part of celebrating 25 years of the company\u2019s existence. The papers in these proceedings were from keynotes, panel discussions and papers, selected after careful review of over 100 technical submissions delivered at RIC 2021. The technical papers were grouped into sessions based on their subject areas. The conference aimed to stimulate discussions that could help the industry work towards overcoming geotechnical engineering limitations today. It also sought to foster creative thinking that will advance the current states of the art and practice. The keynote addresses, panel discussions and technical presentations tried to examine geotechnical problems and situations from fresh perspectives. RIC 2021 hopes that the proceedings will continue to enrich our thinking and contribute to achieving a critical mass of change in our practices and approaches. We look forward to significant improvements in our industry",

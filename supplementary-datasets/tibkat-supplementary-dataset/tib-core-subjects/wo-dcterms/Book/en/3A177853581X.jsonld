In 2018, the Centre for Child Law celebrates 20 Years of strategic litigation, research and advocacy in order to advance child law and children\u2019s rights in South Africa. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child have played an important role in shaping children\u2019s rights jurisprudence in South Africa. This booklet is accompanied by a flash drive that contains a number of General Comments issued by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. This is an updatable resource \u2013 as the Committees produce future General Comments and issue views arising from their communications procedures, the new documents can be added to the flash drive, allowing this small compendium to grow as the jurisprudence expands",

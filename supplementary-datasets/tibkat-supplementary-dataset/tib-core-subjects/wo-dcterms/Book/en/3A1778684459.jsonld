            "abstract": "This book is a collection of excellent reviews and perspectives contributed by experts in the multidisciplinary field of basic science, clinical studies and treatment options for a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases or cancer. The goal has been to demonstrate that persistent or chronic (unresolved or subclinical) inflammation is a common denominator in the genesis, progression and manifestation of many illnesses and/or cancers, particularly during the aging process. Understanding the fundamental basis of shared and interrelated immunological features of unresolved inflammation in initiation and progression of chronic diseases or cancer are expected to hold real promises when the designs of cost-effective strategies are considered for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a number of age-associated illnesses such as autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases as well as many cancers",

            "title": "Real-time Linked Dataspaces : Enabling Data Ecosystems for Intelligent Systems",
            "abstract": "This open access book explores the dataspace paradigm as a best-effort approach to data management within data ecosystems. It establishes the theoretical foundations and principles of real-time linked dataspaces as a data platform for intelligent systems. The book introduces a set of specialized best-effort techniques and models to enable loose administrative proximity and semantic integration for managing and processing events and streams. The book is divided into five major parts: Part I \u201cFundamentals and Concepts\u201d details the motivation behind and core concepts of real-time linked dataspaces, and establishes the need to evolve data management techniques in order to meet the challenges of enabling data ecosystems for intelligent systems within smart environments. Further, it explains the fundamental concepts of dataspaces and the need for specialization in the processing of dynamic real-time data. Part II \u201cData Support Services\u201d explores the design and evaluation of critical services, including catalog, entity management, query and search, data service discovery, and human-in-the-loop. In turn, Part III \u201cStream and Event Processing Services\u201d addresses the design and evaluation of the specialized techniques created for real-time support services including complex event processing, event service composition, stream dissemination, stream matching, and approximate semantic matching. Part IV \u201cIntelligent Systems and Applications\u201d explores the use of real-time linked dataspaces within real-world smart environments. In closing, Part V \u201cFuture Directions\u201d outlines future research challenges for dataspaces, data ecosystems, and intelligent systems. Readers will gain a detailed understanding of how the dataspace paradigm is now being used to enable data ecosystems for intelligent systems within smart environments. The book covers the fundamental theory, the creation of new techniques needed for support services, and lessons learned from real-world intelligent systems and applications focused on sustainability. Accordingly, it will benefit not only researchers and graduate students in the fields of data management, big data, and IoT, but also professionals who need to create advanced data management platforms for intelligent systems, smart environments, and data ecosystems",

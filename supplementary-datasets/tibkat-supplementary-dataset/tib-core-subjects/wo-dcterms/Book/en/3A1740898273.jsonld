            "abstract": "Much of the success of composites can be attributed to the development of innovative processes. Many useful composites are envisaged by materials scientists but the problem of how to make them is often the greater hurdle.This process-oriented book focuses on the basic principles of composite fabrication. Upon studying these processes, one is immediately struck by the diversity of ideas and techniques. In some cases, these have been borrowed from other technologies and were designed for use with quite different materials. In other cases some very clever new means have been developed which take account of the characteristics of metals and ceramics and the higher temperatures which are typically involved in their processing. Many types of metal-matrix composite are covered, and especial care has been taken to treat thoroughly treat the physics and chemistry of the interactions between the matrix and the reinforcement which occur as the composite is formed. This provides a fundamental basis for understanding the important relationships between the mechanics of the processes, the kinetics and thermodynamics of in-process interactions, and the final properties of the composites. This will be an important reference work for all of those who practice the various arts needed to make composites, and for those who continue to explore new ways of forming them. It will also be of great value to those who wish to attain a fundamental understanding of the processes used.1. Introduction. 2. Fabrication Techniques. 3. Capillarity in Composite Fabrication. 4.

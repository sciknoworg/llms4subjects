            "title": "Lymphoma",
            "abstract": "Lymphoma is a group of lymphoid neoplasms originating from B or T lymphocytes. Lymphoma is now the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with a chance of affecting 1:41 men and 1:52 women in their lifetime. The reason for this increase is poorly understood and could be attributed to immunodeficiency, various infections, familial aggregation, blood transfusion, genetic predisposition, diet, and chemical exposures to pesticides and solvents. Our understanding of the molecular biology and genetics of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma has increased exponentially, and new imaging techniques have revolutionized our overall clinical approach to the disease. The seven chapters of this book provide a comprehensive account of these advances. The first four chapters cover the developments in classification of lymphoma in general and a detailed description of specific subtypes of lymphoma, their pathology, and management. Chapter 5 is dedicated to \"Radiomics\", a new imaging technique that could revolutionize the diagnosis of lymphoma and the development of personalized medicine for the management of lymphoma in the days to come. Chapter 6 provides a comprehensive view of the recent progress in the overall management of lymphoma. Finally, Chapter 7 reports patient care in the non-western world, with emphasis on challenges, advances, and sustainability of implementing new diagnostic techniques for the  welfare  of  patients  in  daily  clinical  management  of lymphoma. This book is aimed primarily at clinicians and scientists, but many areas will also be of interest to the layperson",

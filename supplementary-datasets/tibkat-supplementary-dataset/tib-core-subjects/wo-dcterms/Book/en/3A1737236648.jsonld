            "abstract": "\"To successfully compete in today's global marketplace, organizations can and must do more to improve their internal operational efficiencies. Operational Excellence: Using Lean Six Sigma to Translate Customer Value through Global Supply Chains consolidates hundreds of tools and methods into 110 key concepts designed to translate the \"voice of the customer\" throughout global supply chains, dramatically improving productivity and shareholder economic value added (EVA). Recognizing failure is often self-induced through poor leadership coupled with an inability to form and effectively execute a strategic vision, this book operates from three premises- Organizations have the power to increase organizational competitiveness in an era of globalization through the application of Lean Six Sigma Operational performance directly correlates with an organization's financial, operational and resultant productivity, as well as with shareholder EVA metrics, and geographical, cultural, technological and economic isolation Value-adding activities and disciplines such as Lean Six Sigma are not exclusive to any one country or region and do not always depend upon cost considerations A Practical Tool for Real World Application For organizations seeking a source for improving manufacturing and service operations, this bookeffectively delivers. Divided into 5 successive sections, it begins with adaptation strategies for global competitiveness, then delves into implementations to enhance productivity while targeting customer needs and value expectations. Finally, the author explains how to establish information-sharing throughout global supply chains, along with the role of IT. A useful tool for real world application, the volume's 20 chapters also contain more than 450 figures and roadmaps. As organizations understand the interrelationships of the supply chains, their operational systems will excel at meeting or exceeding customer expectations in this age of globalization. This 2nd edition focuses on OPEX methods for service, manufacturing, and supporting functions (e.g. sales operations to back-office support). New topics covered include: Design Thinking, the \"voice-of\" (customer and other stakeholders), Information Technology Ecosystems, Big Data applications through product and process design, operational improvements and measurement. Practical examples are integrated through the book\"--",

            "title": "A Tale of Two Villages$DCoerced Modernization in the East European Countryside",
            "abstract": "This dramatic story of land and power from twentieth-century Eastern Europe is set in two extraordinary villages: a rebel village, where peasants fought the advent of Communism and became its first martyrs, and a model village turned forcibly into a town, Dictator Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s birthplace. The two villages capture among themselves nearly a century of dramatic transformation and social engineering, ending up with their charged heritage in the present European Union. \"One of Romania\u2019s foremost social critics, Alina Mungiu-Pippidi offers a valuable look at several decades of policy that marginalized that country\u2019s rural population, from the 1918 land reform to the post-1989 property restitution. Illustrating her arguments with a close comparison of two contrasting villages, she describes the actions of a long series of \u201cpredatory elites,\u201d from feudal landowners through the Communist Party through post-communist leaders, all of whom maintained the rural population\u2019s dependency. A forceful concluding chapter shows that its prospects for improvement are scarcely better within the EU. Romania\u2019s villagers have an eminent and spirited advocate in the author.\u201d",

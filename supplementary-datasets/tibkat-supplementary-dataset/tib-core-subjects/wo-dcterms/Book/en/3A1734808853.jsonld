                "The book presents recent research and a collection of case studies and real-world experiences relating to building construction. Covering building rehabilitation, building diagnostics, service-life prediction and life-cycles, and hygrothermal behaviour, it bridges the gap between current approaches to the surveying of buildings and the detailed study of defect diagnosis, prognosis and remediation. The book features several case studies on building pathologies as well as a detailed set of references and suggestions for further reading. Offering a systematic review of the current state of knowledge, it is a valuable resource for scientists, students, practitioners, and lecturers in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including civil and materials engineering, as well as and other interested parties. ."

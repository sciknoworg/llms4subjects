            "abstract": "\"As the title implies, the book covers basic but essential material for heat transfer courses at different levels. The book has been made self-contained so that certain parts can be used as introductory material and others as material for more advanced levels. The book is also intended for use by practicing professionals in various engineering fields. Basic also implies concise coverage of wide range of topics at sufficient depth without blowing up the number of pages and cost to extremes as has been the case with many excellent textbooks in recent years. The book is primarily concerned with conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer. The book consists of 14 chapters and 14 appendices. Chapter 1 is a general brief introduction to heat transfer concepts. Chapters 2 and 3 cover the topics of one-dimensional steady-state conduction and extended surfaces which are presented in considerably more detail and depth than most other similar textbooks. Chapter 4 deals with two-dimensional steady-state conduction issues and chapter 5 discusses one- and multi-dimensional non-steady (transient) conduction in some detail. Numerical methods of solving steady and transient conduction problems are presented with a number of illustrative examples and spreadsheet screen shots. Following an introduction to fundamentals of convection heat transfer in chapter 6, forced convection in external and internal flows are discussed in chapters 7 and 8, respectively. Natural (free) convection is covered in chapter 9. Chapters 10 and 11 deal with fundamentals of radiation heat transfer, shape factors, and the exchange of thermal radiation between surfaces separated by transparent and non-transparent media. In dealing with radiation in participating gaseous media, the conventional Hottel charts have been replaced by recently developed charts by Alberti et al on the basis of more accurate spectral data. The comprehensive set of charts include gas emissivity of water vapour, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide together with pressure and binary gas-overlap correction factors. Essentials of heat exchangers and the classical thermal analysis using the log-mean-temperature-difference and NTU-effectiveness approaches is presented in chapter 12. Heat transfer with phase change, and mass transfer are also covered in chapters 13 and 14, respectively. The book has 14 appendices (A to N) four of which (B, C, D, and N) are included in the printed text and the remainder can be accessed online at www.wiley.com/go/Ghojel/heat transfer. Since the primary goal of the book is to provide students with the knowledge and skills needed for practical engineering practice, both analytical and graphical solution techniques are presented. For the latter approach, most charts in the text are duplicated with enlarged versions in the appendix. Also, since computer applications play an integral role in solving complex problems, \"Solaria Thermal\" software package (Harley Thermal) is used in the book, where applicable, to reinforce the relevance of computer-aided solutions of heat transfer problems\"--",

            "abstract": "\"2D Materials for Infrared and Terahertz Detectors provides an overview of emerging detectors' material-based performance while also offering, for the first time, a comparison to traditional materials used in the fabrication of infrared and terahertz detectors. Since the discovery of graphene, its applications to electronic and optoelectronic devices has been intensively researched. The extraordinary electronic and optical properties allow graphene and other 2D materials to be promising candidates for infrared and terahertz photodetectors, and yet it appears that new detectors using these materials are secondary to those using traditional materials. This book explores this as well as other advantages and disadvantages of using 2D materials. Special attention will be directed to the most effective hybrid 2D material in infrared and and terahertz detectors as well as future trends. Written by one of the world's leading researchers in the field of infrared (IR) optoelectronics, this book will be a must-read for researchers and graduate students in photodetector and related fields. Features offers a comprehensive overview of the different types of 2D materials used in fabrication of IR and THz detectors and includes their advantages/disadvantages, first book to compare new detectors to a wide family of common, commercially available detectors that use traditional materials\"--",

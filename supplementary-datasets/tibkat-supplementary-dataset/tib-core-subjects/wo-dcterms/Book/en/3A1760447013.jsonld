            "abstract": "This policy note looks at the institutional architecture and organization of the child protection service delivery in Russia. The objective is to understand how a complex set of child protection actors regulated at federal, regional and local levels functions on the ground and it is intended to inform the policy debate in Russia about effective and efficient ways to organize the delivery of child protection policies and programs. For a closer look, two regions serve as case studies: the Leningrad Oblast and the Republic of Tatarstan. These two regions were chosen, first, because they both have lower rates of children entering public care than many other regions in Russia and, second, because they have spearheaded the child protection system changes but each in its own way, providing an opportunity to illustrate a variety of approaches that Russian regions have chosen to pursue. The Note focuses is on formally reported children who are left without parental care and have been placed under the state care (children in formal care; children in care or looked after children) and on families in difficult life situations, at risk or in crisis in need of assistance to mitigate the risk and/or overcome crisis and prevent family separation. The note is a follow up to several earlier World Bank studies on child welfare in Russia, including children with disabilities, prepared over in 2017-2018 as part of the Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) with the Russian Agency for Strategic Initiatives.3 It is based on the following sources of information: (i) legal and strategic documents at the federal, regional and local levels; (ii) official statistical data on children left without parental care and children in public care collected at the federal level: data on the number of biological and social orphans identified and recorded each year (inflow); data on the total (stock) number of children without parental care and data on the forms of their placement); and data from the Federal Databank of Orphaned Children, and (iii) information obtained through a qualitative study using a series of in-depth expert interviews with policy makers and practitioners in the Leningrad Oblast and the Republic of Tatarstan",

                "Digital sovereignty\u2014the exercise of control over the Internet\u2014is the ambition of the world\u2019s leaders, from Australia to Zimbabwe, a bulwark against both foreign state and foreign corporation. Governments have resoundingly answered first-generation Internet law questions of who if anyone should regulate the Internet\u2014they all will. The second-generation question to confront is not whether, but how to regulate the Internet. This volume features new theoretical perspectives on digital sovereignty and explores cutting-edge issues associated with it. Drawing mainly on various theories concerning political economy, international law, human rights, and data protection, it presents thought-provoking ideas about the nature and scope of digital sovereignty. It also examines the extent to which new technological developments in sectors, such as artificial intelligence, e-commerce, and sharing economy, have posed challenges to assertion of digital sovereignty, and considers how to deal with such challenges. In particular, the volume discusses the promise and pitfalls of digital sovereignty in the process of trade liberalization, data localization, and human rights protection",
                "\"The internet was supposed to end sovereignty. \"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, you have no sovereignty where we gather,\" John Perry Barlow famously declared. Sovereignty would prove impossible over a world of bits, with the internet simply routing around futile controls. But reports of the death of sovereignty over the internet proved premature. Consider recent events\"--"

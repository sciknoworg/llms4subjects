            "abstract": "The operation of numerous components that are critical to safety in industries around the world relies on protective coatings. These coatings often allow process equipment to serve a purpose in environments well beyond the operational limit of the uncoated components. Durability, ease of application, repairability, reliability and long-term performance of such coatings are all key to their application. Therefore, this book, Coatings for Harsh Environments, is devoted to research and review articles on the metallic, non-metallic and composite coatings used in aggressive environments. In particular, the topics of interest include, but are not limited to: coatings for high temperature and molten salt applications; thermal spray and cold spray coatings for aggressive environments; corrosion, wear and cavitation resistant coatings; coatings for mitigating marine corrosion; coatings for chemical and petrochemical plants; thermal barrier coatings",

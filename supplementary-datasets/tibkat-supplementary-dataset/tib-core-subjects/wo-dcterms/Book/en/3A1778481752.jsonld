            "title": "Between Erudition and Faith. Jean-Jacques Chifflet\u2019s Tract on the Shroud of Besan\u00e7on (1624) : Between Erudition and Faith",
            "abstract": "The shroud of Besan\u00e7on, a large cloth considered being a precious relic, an \u201cimprint\u201d left by Christ\u2019s body on his burial linen, knew a period of intense veneration and public debate from the early 16th century to the end of the 18th century. With the publication of De linteis sepulchralibus Christi servatoris crisis historica (Antwerp, 1624), a treatise that was as erudite as it was intellectually and conceptually biased, the Bisontine author Jean-Jacques Chifflet significantly contributed to his local shroud\u2019s perception and reception. A noteworthy selection of visual material, among it the very first reproduction of the shroud of Besan\u00e7on in a print medium, was an important part of the book\u2019s argument. The present article offers a close reading of parts of Chifflet\u2019s treatise, with a particular attention given to the author\u2019s targeted use of engravings as illustrationes (images meant to, quite literally, illuminate the text, its meaning and intention), thus looking at this representation of a local relic as a part and as a product of a cultural practice and of shared notions",

            "abstract": "This monograph is about the metaphor of reflection in a mirror, frequently used in Indian philosophical traditions to address metaphysical, epistemological, and theological problems arising from a non-reductionist approach to consciousness. The metaphor stands for the idea that, just as a face, reflected in a mirror, appears where it is not, so do consciousness and its properties, such as the sense of self, subjectivity, and experience of qualia, stand in falsely perceived relations to cognitive and perceptive processes. The book explores various models of interaction between consciousness, the mind-body complex, and the world, based on the metaphor of reflection, in the philosophical schools of S\u0101\u1e43khya, Yoga, and Advaita-Ved\u0101nta. Mirror of Nature, Mirror of Self is the first systematic exploration of mirror models of consciousness across traditions. By grounding these theories in their historical intellectual context, the book sheds new light on an intense philosophical conversation between Indian reductionists and non-reductionists about consciousness. The book explores the impact of Indian mirror models on theories of mental representation, theories of knowledge, philosophy of language, debates on illusory causality and on the relationship between noumena and phenomena, as well as soteriological and theological theories. In a dialogue with psychoanalytical theory and analytic philosophy of mind, the book defends a new model of consciousness, integrating consciousness-mind dualism, mind naturalism, and representationalism about consciousness.",

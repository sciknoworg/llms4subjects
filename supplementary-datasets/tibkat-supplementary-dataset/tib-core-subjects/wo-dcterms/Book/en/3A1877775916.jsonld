            "title": "Ageless Arete : Selected Essays from the 6th Interdisciplinary Symposium on the Hellenic Heritage of Sicily and Southern Italy",
            "abstract": "Arete is a crucial concept in ancient Greek culture that defies simple translation. In general, it indicates excellence\u2014especially of human beings, but also of animals, institutions, even objects. It is linked to important concepts such as glory, justice, truth and harmony. It influences important activities such as religion, athletics, politics, and education. This collection demonstrates the length and breadth of arete\u2019s importance in ancient Greek and Roman culture, from its prehistorical etymological roots to its mystification in pre-Christian theology and even its manifestation in the career of a modern archaeologist. Leaving aside Plato and Aristotle, to whom a companion volume has been dedicated, these essays explore arete in Presocratic philosophy, classical oratory, epinician poetry, tragic drama, ancient Sicilian history, Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Neoplatonic thought. To many, arete was inherited by blood from the Homeric heroes, a birthright of social elites used to reinforce traditional hierarchies in the classical polis. To others, arete was an achievement distinct from social advantage but expected to advantage society. To understand arete philosophically, we must explore its wider cultural function\u2014and vice versa. Arete is an enduring\u2014even ageless\u2014concept that, properly understood, may benefit humanity even today",

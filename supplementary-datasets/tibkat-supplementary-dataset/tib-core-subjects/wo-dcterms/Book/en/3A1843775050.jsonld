            "abstract": "Women, Business and the Law 2023 is the ninth in a series of annual studies measuring the laws and regulations that affect women's economic opportunity in 190 economies.The project presents eight indicators structured around women's interactions with the law as they move through their lives and careers: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship, Assets, and Pension. The 2023 edition identifies barriers to women's economic participation and encourages reform of discriminatory laws. This year, the study also includes research, a literature review, and analysis of 53 years of reforms for women's rights.  Examining the economic decisions that women make throughout their working lives as well as tracking regulatory changes from 1970 to today, the study makes an important contribution to research and policy discussions about the state of women's economic opportunities. By presenting powerful examples of change and highlighting the gaps still remaining, Women, Business and the Law 2023 is a vital tool in ensuring economic empowerment for all. Data in Women, Business and the Law 2023 are current as of October 1, 2022",

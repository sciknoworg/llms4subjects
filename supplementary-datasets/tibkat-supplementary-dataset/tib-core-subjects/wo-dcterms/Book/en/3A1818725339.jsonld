            "abstract": "\"This textbook provides a comprehensive guide to fracture mechanics and its applications. Providing an in-depth discussion of both linear elastic and nonlinear fracture mechanics, it is an essential companion to the study of all types of engineering. Beginning with four foundational chapters, discussing the theory in depth, the book also presents specific aspects of fracture mechanics and fatigue. These chapters include crack growth and fractures in engineering materials under a wide range of loading and environmental conditions. Other topics include material testing and selection for damage tolerant design, alongside a discussion of ensuring the structural integrity of components. Alongside a strong focus on the practical applications of fracture mechanics and fatigue, the book will also provide a clear working of the theory and includes appendices with additional background to ensure a comprehensive understanding. Every chapter ends with both solved and unsolved example problems and end of chapter problems, and instructor support materials are also available. This interdisciplinary textbook will be useful to all students in fracture mechanics, in Mechanical, Aerospace, Civil, and Materials Engineering. It will also be useful for professionals in any industry dealing with fracture mechanics and fatigue\"--",

            "abstract": "This book deals with different aspects of gravity that has proved its effectiveness throughout the world, hence their solicitation in recent years. Fundamental theories, applications, and tools have been presented, emphasizing the implementation of the gravity technique. Different research themes for diverse areas in the world are detailed here, highlighting new methods of studies that could be helpful for sophisticated and modern development over the next few years. Four main sections are presented: Gravity Interpretation Tools in Geoscience, Gravity in Geoscience Applications, Gravity in Industrial Technology, and Quantum Gravity. Theoretical and acquisition tools and adapted processing methods have been designed to take into account the initial data, and modeling results thus converge toward a better solution. This book, which makes a worthwhile contribution to the topic gravity, is specifically addressed to specialists, researchers, and industry professionals who shall find its content extremely useful for a better comprehension of the geological, spatial, and industrial aspects of gravity",

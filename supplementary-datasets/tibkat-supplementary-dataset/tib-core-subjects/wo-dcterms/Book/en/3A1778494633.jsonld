            "title": "Fractional Differential Equations: Theory, Methods and Applications",
            "abstract": "Fractional calculus provides the possibility of introducing integrals and derivatives of an arbitrary order in the mathematical modelling of physical processes, and it has become a relevant subject with applications to various fields, such as anomalous diffusion, propagation in different media, and propogation in relation to materials with different properties. However, many aspects from theoretical and practical points of view have still to be developed in relation to models based on fractional operators. This Special Issue is related to new developments on different aspects of fractional differential equations, both from a theoretical point of view and in terms of applications in different fields such as physics, chemistry, or control theory, for instance. The topics of the Issue include fractional calculus, the mathematical analysis of the properties of the solutions to fractional equations, the extension of classical approaches, or applications of fractional equations to several fields",

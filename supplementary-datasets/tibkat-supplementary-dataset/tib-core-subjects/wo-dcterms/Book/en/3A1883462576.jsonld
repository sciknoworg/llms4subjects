            "abstract": "This work proposes a standardized CS-NER task by defining a set of seven contribution-centric scholarly entities for CS NER viz., research problem , solution , resource , language , tool , method , and dataset. The main contributions are: 1) Merges annotations for contribution-centric named entities from related work as the following datasets: The dataset proposed in Analyzing the Dynamics of Research by Extracting Key Aspects of Scientific Papers (Gupta & Manning, IJCNLP 2011) is the source for ftd, annotated for both titles and abstracts for the following select entities mapped to our standardized types focus -> solution ; domain -> research problem ; and technique -> method  The dataset proposed in Multi-Task Identification of Entities, Relations, and Coreference for Scientific Knowledge Graph Construction (Luan et al., EMNLP 2018) is the source for scierc, annotated for abstracts for the following select entities with mappings task -> research problem  The dataset proposed in SemEval-2021 Task 11: NLPContributionGraph - Structuring Scholarly NLP Contributions for a Research Knowledge Graph (D\u2019Souza et al., SemEval 2021) is the source for ncg, annotated for both titles and abstracts for research problem  https://paperswithcode.com/ as the pwc annotated for both titles and abstracts for task -> research problem and method entities. 2) Additionally, supplies a new annotated dataset for the titles in the ACL anthology in the acl repository where titles are annotated with all seven entities.",

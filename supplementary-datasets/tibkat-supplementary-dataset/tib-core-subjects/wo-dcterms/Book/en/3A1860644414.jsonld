                "This book offers a solution to one of film history\u2019s major controversies: the long-running dispute over Orson Welles\u2019 and Herman J. Mankiewicz\u2019s contributions to the Citizen Kane screenplay. It establishes the vital importance of computing and statistics to solving previously intractable puzzles in the arts and humanities. Citizen Kane (1941) is one of the most acclaimed films in the history of cinema. For 50 years it topped the Sight & Sound film critics\u2019 poll. Orson Welles directed the film and is credited with co-writing the screenplay with Herman J. Mankiewicz. But the co-writer credit generates furious disputes between those who argue Mankiewicz is the sole author of Citizen Kane and those who claim that Welles collaborated fully with its writing. The author employs computing and statistics to answer two questions: What are the distinguishing features of Welles\u2019 and of Mankiewicz\u2019s writing? And What did each contribute to the writing of the Citizen Kane screenplay? To answer these questions, the author bypasses opinions and impressions, and instead subjects the language of the Citizen Kane screenplay to a \u2018forensic\u2019 examination. Employing linguistics, basic statistical tests, plus computer technology and software, the author identifies the stylistic signature of each author \u2013 the combination of consistent and regular linguistic habits that make each author\u2019s writing distinctive. This book replaces impressionistic discussions of Mankiewicz\u2019s and Welles\u2019 contributions to the Citizen Kane screenplay with a rigorous, experiment-driven statistical analysis. Earlier statistical studies of authorship have discovered that small, unassuming language features (such as punctuation, pronouns, and prepositions) in statistically significant quantities, constitute a screenwriter\u2019s distinctive writing habits. Only with the extensive experimentation carried out in this volume, did the author decide Mankiewicz\u2019s and Welles\u2019 specific habits and their contributions to Citizen Kane."

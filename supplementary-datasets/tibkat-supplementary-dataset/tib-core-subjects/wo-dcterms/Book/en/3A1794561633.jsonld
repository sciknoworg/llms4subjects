It is dedicated to exploring the role of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in various chronic diseases. The main goal of the articles is to describe recent progress in elucidating the mechanisms by which IDPs cause various human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidosis, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and genetic diseases, to name a few. Contributed by leading investigators in the field, this compendium serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians as well as postdoctoral fellows and graduate students",

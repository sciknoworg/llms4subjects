                "Features practical application of theories and demonstrates calculations using real-life examplesUltrasonic testing is a relatively new branch of science and industry. Its testing methodologies are particularly useful for high-risk working environments, such as a nuclear power plant. Without knowing the nuances of the ultrasonic wave propagation in a test object, it is impossible to design effective inspection techniques and search units for its realization.Based on the author's broad ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) experience, this book addresses the theoretical differences of ultrasonics from other wave propagation theories, presenting not only the basics of physics in the wave propagation and elementary mathematics, but also advanced, practical applications. Each chapter represents unique structural characteristics, and nondestructive testing and calculation methods are offered accordingly.The book begins with overviews of NDT methods and the principals of search unit design and, particularly, probes for an automated inspection. Next, it covers probe designs such as single angle beam, dual straight and angle beam, and multi-crystal, as well as designs for TOFD technique application and for inspecting several types of cylindrical rods. The next chapters address technique development and probe design for inspection of thin hollow cylinders by Lamb-type guided waves; probe design for immersion method inspection; and probe design and techniques for reactor pressure vessel and nozzle inner radius inspection. Both contact and immersion techniques are discussed, and ample practical examples and problem-solving methods are included.This practical reference gives NDT specialists, engineers, and technicians, as well as material/structural and nuclear plant engineers, the fundamentals they need for everyday activity in ultrasonic technology and search unit design and application",

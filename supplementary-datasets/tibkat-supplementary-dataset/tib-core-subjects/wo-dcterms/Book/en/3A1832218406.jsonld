The first volume of the \"Mineralogical Crystallography\" Special Issue [1] consisted of such topics as: Discovery of new mineral species; Crystal chemistry of minerals and their synthetic analogs; Behavior of minerals at non-ambient conditions; Biomineralogy; and Crystal growth techniques, and appeared to be very fruitful. The Special Issue \"Mineralogical Crystallography Volume II\" covers the following topics: Crystal chemistry and properties of minerals and their synthetic analogs; Gemology; Natural-based cement materials; Biomineralogy; and Crystal growth techniques. Additionally, we hope that this continuation will be just as successful, and that the new set of papers will again arouse genuine interest among readers and, perhaps, inspire them in their own successful research. We also believe that with the current collection of papers, we will be able to pay tribute to the union of Mineralogy and Crystallography",

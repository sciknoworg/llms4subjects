            "abstract": "The need for evidence-based practice to enhance current and future police training and assessment has never been greater. This need focuses on the procedures and findings of research within the field of police work along with the philosophy guiding these research approaches and commentaries on the methods being used. With many future directions for the science of police training and assessment, the focus on new training techniques and technologies for improving performance is of the upmost importance to find the best current, evidence-based practices for policing. In addition to these practices, understanding the practical realities and challenges of implementing cutting-edge procedures is essential in gaining a holistic view on police well-being and performance.Interventions, Training, and Technologies for Improved Police Well-Being and Performance is a critical publication that explores new training methods and technologies. The future of policing is poised to change, making the need for developments in evidence-based practices more important than ever before. New technology and techniques for improving performance and the perception of the police force can guide the policies and practices of law enforcement, trainers and academies, government officials, policymakers, psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, to a more effective implementation of training and procedures. Including the perspective of police officers within the publication, this text offers insight into an often neglected viewpoint when creating training and policies. This text is also be beneficial for researchers, academicians, and students interested in the new training techniques, technologies, and interventions for police performance and well-being",

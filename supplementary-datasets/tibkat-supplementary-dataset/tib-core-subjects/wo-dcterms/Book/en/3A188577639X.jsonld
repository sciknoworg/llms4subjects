            "abstract": "Neuropediatrics is a branch of health care that involves the diagnosis and treatment of congenital and acquired diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems in children and adolescents. In history, as the medical care opportunities for severe neural injuries were minimal, children with brain damage were usually rejected and many of them died early from infections, inappropriate treatment, and neglect. Since the middle of the twentieth century, due to the development of neuropathology and advanced brain diagnostic tools, neural damage during childbirth was for the first time defined as the most fundamental cause of cerebral injury, bringing attention to the focus of brain damage. Since then, novel scientific approaches have made extraordinary improvements in the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of infants and children with neural injuries. However, there are still major scientific, ethical, and therapeutic challenges for the future, especially in prenatal diagnosis, neonatology, intensive care, therapy, and more. This book offers comprehensive knowledge about the current state of the art in neuropediatrics, concentrating on the most significant evidence-based advances in this important field",

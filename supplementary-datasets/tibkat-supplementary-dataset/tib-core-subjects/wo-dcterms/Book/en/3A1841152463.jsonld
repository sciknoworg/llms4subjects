            "abstract": "This book presents a comprehensive overview of bridge and road engineering. Apart from bridge structures, roads and highways are integral to the advancement of cities. The lack of quantifiable, sustainable construction methods creates gaps in sustainability knowledge, leading to public, environmental, and financial dissatisfaction with completed highways and urban roads. This book discusses the key points in the design and construction assessment of bridges, highways, and roads. Chapters discuss such topics as bridge optimization techniques, risk assessment of roads, highway management systems, and challenges in highway construction. The book provides detailed insight into the impact of bridges and roads on the environment and the benefits of adopting development assessment systems to increase the safety of bridge structures, roads, and highways",

            "abstract": "\"Since the late 1990?s, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have been recognized worldwide as an enabling technology for the development of advanced platforms serving the commercial, military, and aerospace sectors. The subsequent emergence of space-qualified LIB?s for space applications has created a demand for a single-source reference for space LIB power systems, and the widespread increase in commercial suppliers of spacecraft for NASA and other customers underscores the fast- growing need for battery energy storage solutions. Spacecraft Battery Power Systems will be the one of the first books to provide a comprehensive treatment of the broad area of spacecraft battery power systems technology. It will emphasize the technical aspects across the entire lifecycle of spacecraft batteries including the design, manufacturing, test, performance, and safety engineering principles needed to field a reliable electrical power system. A special focus on rechargeable LIB technologies as they apply to manned and un-manned space vehicles, satellites, deep-space interplanetary mission vehicles (such as orbiters, landers, rovers and probes) and launch vehicle applications will be emphasized. In selected topical areas (such as battery management systems), the book will aim to bridge knowledge gaps that typically exist between academic and industry practitioners\"--",

            "title": "The Family Firm : Monarchy, Mass Media and the British Public, 1932-53",
            "abstract": "The Family Firm presents the first major historical analysis of the transformation of the royal household\u2019s public relations strategy in the period 1932-1953. Beginning with King George V\u2019s first Christmas broadcast, Buckingham Palace worked with the Church of England and the media to initiate a new phase in the House of Windsor\u2019s approach to publicity. This book also focuses on audience reception by exploring how British readers, listeners, and viewers made sense of royalty\u2019s new media image. It argues that the monarchy\u2019s deliberate elevation of a more informal and vulnerable family-centred image strengthened the emotional connections that members of the public forged with the royals, and that the tightening of these bonds had a unifying effect on national life in the unstable years during and either side of the Second World War. Crucially, The Family Firm also contends that the royal household\u2019s media strategy after 1936 helped to restore public confidence in a Crown that was severely shaken by the abdication of King Edward VIII",

            "abstract": "\"The present book focuses on the biologically derived adsorbent with numerous applications in wastewater treatment, metal recovery, biosensor development, and so forth. It initiates with the description of biological sources of biosorbents followed by applications of biosorbents, biosorption isotherms, assessment of biosorbents with various tools, pre-treatment of biosorbents, and its mode of action. Some less explored areas like separation of radionuclides, biosorption of volatile organic compounds, and animal-based biosorbents are also explained. It focusses on fundamentals, characteristics of flora and fauna-mediated biosorbents used extensively and describes entire aspects of tools and techniques related to assessment and monitoring of biosorbents. The book includes adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm and mechanism of action of biosorbents and covers advancements of pre-treatment methods to enhance the adsorption process of biosorbents. It also reviews recent applications which include, heavy metal removal, dye remediation, separation of radionuclides and nano-biosorbents. This book is aimed at graduate students and researchers in bioprocess engineering, microbiology, biotechnology\"--",

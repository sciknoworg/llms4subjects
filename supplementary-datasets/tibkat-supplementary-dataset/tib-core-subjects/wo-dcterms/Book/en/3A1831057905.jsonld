                "This book presents the latest accomplishments in Novikov/conformal gearing as well as high-conformal gearing. It is focused primarily on strength calculation of gear teeth and the manufacturing of gears for Novikov/conformal and high-conformal gearing along with a brief discussion of achievements in the modern theory of gearing. The modern theory of gearing is the foundation of all optimal designs of gears, gear-sets, and transmissions of all known designs, as well as, of all those to be developed in the future. As even a small improvement in efficiency on a single gear can represent a significant cost saving, given the millions of gears used in industry every year, this volume provides the design and manufacturing engineer in invaluable resource. Explains the key features of Novikov/conformal and high-conformal gearing, many still unclear to even to experts; Provides practical recommendations on how the highest possible efficiency of gear transmissions can be attained; Outlines future developments in the field of Novikov/conformal and for high-conformal gearing."

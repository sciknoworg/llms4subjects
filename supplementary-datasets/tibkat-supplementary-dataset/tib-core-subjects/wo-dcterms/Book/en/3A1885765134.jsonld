                "\"Professional medical interpreting services are crucial to provide quality healthcare to allophone patients, but these services are not always available. This means that healthcare professionals must sometimes make do with what they have on hand to communicate with these patients, with all the negative consequences such makeshift solutions may involve. Medical Interpreting: Training the Professionals presents the results of the three-year project Research & Action and Training in Medical Interpreting (ReACTMe), funded by the European Commission, aimed at analysing the situation in the three countries involved in the project: Spain, Italy and Romania. This publication provides readers not only with an overview of the current situation regarding medical interpreting in these three countries seen from different perspectives (decision makers, trainers, professional interpreters, healthcare professionals and patients), but also with training resources and a proposed programme for the training of professional medical interpreters. Ideal reading for medical interpreting trainers, researchers and practitioners, the publication is also of interest to healthcare professionals as it includes a decalogue in five languages on how to work with interpreters in medical settings\"--",
                "\u00abThis comprehensive, insightful and well-researched work is an essential and timely contribution to sustaining the training of healthcare interpreters. It provides an important foundation for trainers, researchers and practitioners, based on a thorough and up-to-date reflection on the challenges and needs of healthcare interpreting today, and on the development of training materials for interpreter trainers carried out by the European project ReACTMe. It is a rich, powerful, compelling and much needed book in the field of healthcare interpreting studies.\u00bb (Dora Sales, Senior Lecturer, Department of Translation and Communication, Jaume I University, Spain) \u00abThis volume breaks new ground by examining health inequities through a pedagogical and justice-oriented lens in the context of healthcare interpreting in Spain, Italy and Romania. By foregrounding specialized training that targets both emerging interpreters as well as trainers, the authors offer a fresh look at teaching and learning for healthcare interpreters by offering authentic, creative resources that can be adapted for any national context.\u00bb (Melissa Wallace, Associate Professor of Translation and Interpreting Studies and Director of the Graduate Certificate in Translation & Interpreting Studies, University of Texas at San Antonio, USA) Medical Interpreting: Training the Professionals presents the results of the project Research & Action and Training in Medical Interpreting (ReACTMe) funded by the European Commission, which analysed the interpreting services offered in healthcare settings in Spain, Italy and Romania.

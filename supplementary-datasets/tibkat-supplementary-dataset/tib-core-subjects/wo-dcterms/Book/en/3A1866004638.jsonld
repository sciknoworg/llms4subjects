            "abstract": "\"Transportation is the lifeline of any nation, connecting people, supporting the economy, and facilitating the delivery of vital goods and services. Past failures and terrorist attacks on such transportation systems, in the U.S. and abroad, have demonstrated such systems' vulnerability, the consequences of any potential damage and disruption, as well as the substantial impacts on people, property, and the economy. Now more than ever, it has become imperative for public transit and transportation systems, as well as the many private businesses operating in these sectors, to develop comprehensive security programs. This includes accounting for both natural and man-made hazards-and safeguarding people, places, and equipment-while at the same time ensuring operations continuity. The book covers all transportation critical infrastructure-their modes and their interconnectivity-including highway, aviation, freight and passenger rail, transit, maritime and pipelines. Chapters provide learning objectives, key words, and discussion questions pedagogical elements as well as several case studies in each chapter to facilitate a practical understanding of the concepts presented. New to this edition is information on passenger aviation security and a chapter dedicated to gas and oil pipelines as well as an increased focus throughout on recent cyberattacks, to emphasize the need for physical and cybersecurity integration. Introduction to Transportation Security, Second Edition serves as a comprehensive, practical overview for students in transportation management, homeland security, and emergency management programs as well as an up-to-date reference for professionals charged with safeguarding the movement of assets within our interconnected transportation network\"--",

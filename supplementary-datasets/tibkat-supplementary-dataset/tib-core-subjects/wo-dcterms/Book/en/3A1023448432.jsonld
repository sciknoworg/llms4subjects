                "Chrystal and Mizen have done researchers and students with an interest in central banking the great service of collecting the most commonly cited papers in this area into two volumes. I have no doubt that these volumes will find their way to the reading lists of many graduate and advanced undergraduate courses, as well as into the bookshelves of many monetary economists. These volumes collect many modern classics in the monetary policy area and deserve to be read and reread - as they undoubtedly will - by advanced students and established researchers alike.' - Stefan Gerlach, University of Frankfurt and Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany Monetary policy in the major industrial countries has largely been a success story in recent years. This two-volume set includes previously published papers by Nobel Laureates, central bankers and leading research economists. The key advances in recent thinking that underpin modern monetary policy and indicate some of the current controversies that remain are brought together in this timely publication. Some of these challenges will continue to dominate the thinking of scholars and practitioners for years to come. An authoritative introduction by the editors provides a fascinating guide to this important field"

                "This open access book is the first comprehensive and systematic study of Chinese Marxist literary criticism as an independent theoretical form. It discusses and describes the theoretical features of the Chinese form of Marxist literary criticism by refining and re-interpreting the iconic key concepts of \u201cpeople,\u201d \u201cnation,\u201d \u201cpolitics,\u201d \u201cpraxis,\u201d along with the relationships between literature, technology and capital. Literary criticism and value judgment has also been discussed at length with insightful and valuable views being provided. This book is a brilliant introduction to the topic and ideal academic material for global readers to grasp the essence of Chinese Marxist literary critical thought. Yamin Hu is Professor at Central China Normal University. She is one of the leading Chinese scholars in the areas of Marxist literary theory studies, literary criticism, comparative literature and narrative studies.

She has hosted a number of national-level funding programs, including two Major Projects of the National Social Science Fund. Her publications include over 12 monographs, textbooks, translations, and more than 100 academic articles.

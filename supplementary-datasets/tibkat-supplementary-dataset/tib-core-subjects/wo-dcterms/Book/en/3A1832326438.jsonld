            "abstract": "It has been more than 140 years since water was used to generate electricity. Especially since the 1970s, with the advancement of science and technology, new technologies, new processes, and new materials have been widely used in hydropower construction. Engineering equipment and technology, as well as cascade development, have become increasingly mature, making possible the construction of many high dams and large reservoirs in the world. However, with the passage of time, hydropower infrastructure such as reservoirs, dams, and power stations built in large numbers in the past are aging. This, coupled with singular use of hydropower, limits the development of hydropower in the future. This book reports the achievements in hydropower construction and the efforts of sustainable hydropower development made by various countries around the globe. These existing innovative studies and applications stimulate new ideas for the renewal of hydropower infrastructure and the further improvement of hydropower development and utilization efficiency",

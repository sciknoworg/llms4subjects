            "abstract": "\"Biopolymers are created in nature by a variety of bacteria and plants. Microorganisms make biopolymers that require specialized nutrients and controlled environmental conditions. Biopolymers are classified in a variety of ways based on their size. Biopolymers are characterized as blends, composites, or laminates based on their composition. Biopolymer blends are polymers derived from several sources, such as the marketable artefact Ecovio (BASF AG), which is a combination of PLA and poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) (Ecoflex, BASF AG). Composites, blends, and interpenetrating polymer networks are examples of heterogeneous materials (IPNs). Blends and IPNs are made up of dual or supplementary polymers that have been combined. IPNs, as opposed to blends, are generated by two distinct polymer networks that are cross-linked to provide a characteristic shape. Biopolymer-based nanocomposites are constituents made mostly of biopolymer conditions with nanofiller distributed in them. Biopolymers are polymers also derived from existing entities; thus, they are recyclable and biocompatible; also, they have a diversity of efficient assemblies that allow control of the interface with nanofiller and multiscale assembly. Microorganisms are also crucial in the production of a wide range of biopolymers, including polysaccharides, polyesters, and polyamides, which range from viscous solutions to plastics. This chapter will concentrate on biopolymers, their mixes, composites, and various applications i.e. Plasticization, insertion of fillers and reinforcements, mixing, and impact modification are all methods for adjusting the possessions of biopolymers to suit the intended purpose.\"--",

            "abstract": "Being an inter-disciplinary subject, Signal Processing has application in almost all scientific fields. Applied Signal Processing tries to link between the analog and digital signal processing domains. Since the digital signal processing techniques have evolved from its analog counterpart, this book begins by explaining the fundamental concepts in analog signal processing and then progresses towards the digital signal processing. This will help the reader to gain a general overview of the whole subject and establish links between the various fundamental concepts. While the focus of this book is on the fundamentals of signal processing, the understanding of these topics greatly enhances the confident use as well as further development of the design and analysis of digital systems for various engineering and medical applications. Applied Signal Processing also prepares readers to further their knowledge in advanced topics within the field of signal processing",

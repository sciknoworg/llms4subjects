            "abstract": "Andina is a joint initiative started by a group of nine emerging Colombian architecture and design studios based in various cities, each with a shared focus on the betterment of their profession and an approach to construction that prioritizes diversity. The book presents a selection of current projects from each studio and aims to foster open dialogues about contemporary Colombian architecture. The project was inspired after the Covid-19 pandemic sparked a group conversation about projects that had been put on hold. Over a period of two years of intermittent lockdowns, these conversations, mostly held by video conference, provided an opportunity to analyze how international media and publications had failed to focus on Colombia?s rich architectural scene of the past two decades. The nine studios comprising this collective represent a newly emerging generation of contemporary architecture in Columbia that is not to be overlooked",

            "abstract": "\"Exploring the link between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the built environment, this erudite Companion provides a comprehensive overview and critical examination of key topics and complex research issues. Structured around the 5Ps of the SDGs - people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnerships - the Companion suggests potential routes for the future direction of research within this multidisciplinary field of study. Featuring thought-provoking contributions from an array of acclaimed scholars, the Companion analyses seminal literature and outlines up-to-date definitions for key concepts such as climate change, vulnerability, disaster risk, climate finance, and their connections to the built environment. Providing an examination of the theoretical dimensions of the field, it also explores the historical, current and future trends towards the realisation of the SDGs. Chapters further recognise the crucial role of the sustainable built environment in achieving the 17 SDGs as set out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, presenting original expert analysis on key topics across these 17 goals. Innovative in its approach, this timely Companion will prove essential for researchers and students interested in construction and project management, industry, innovation and infrastructure, sustainable cities and communities, and urban and regional studies. It will also serve as a main source of reference for practitioners and decision-makers, acting as a guiding document for the built environment sector\"--",

Each of the eight standards cover the following issues: expectations, diversity and achievement; personal and professional values; values in the classroom values, rights and responsibilities in the wider community; the community of the school; professional relationships; personal and professional development; professional responsibility. This practical and jargon-free guide features an extensive range of examples and suggestions for further reading, designed to help those in their early professional development.",

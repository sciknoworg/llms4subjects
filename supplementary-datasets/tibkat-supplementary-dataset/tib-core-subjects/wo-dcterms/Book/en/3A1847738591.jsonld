            "abstract": "\"Biotechnology has expanded to assume various hues - red, blue, grey, gold, etc.; and the very important, white biotechnology! Both chemistry and biochemistry come into play in all these colours of biotechnology. This book is an effort at (a) bringing clarity to the interface between the so-called basic sciences and the ways these interfaces segue to biotechnology, (b) discussing an eclectic mix of phenomena which need more attention by biotechnologists than generally available in the present books, and (c) identifying a few approaches/areas which show clear potential to occupy centre stage in biotechnology. Biocatalysis is at the heart of a major component of biotechnology. So many books discuss enzyme kinetics; none provides a check-list to guide us about obtaining high quality data or judging the soundness of the available data. Robust biocatalysts allow working with even gaseous phases at high temperatures. Enzymes can be also tailored by bio-imprinting. Obtaining robust enzymes from extremophiles or exploiting marine microbial resources is also covered. Combinatorial processes rather than rational synthesis have led to identifying protein-ligand specificities via high throughput screening methods. Understanding birth and death of proteins has led to our being able to manipulate protein homeostasis - a key phenomenon associated with the health of an organism. Even nanomaterials can have chirality; quantum dots are part of powerful fluorescence-based methods for imaging cellular processes. The smart-phone is likely to become an integral part of health and nutrition aspects as integrated part of biosensors\"--",

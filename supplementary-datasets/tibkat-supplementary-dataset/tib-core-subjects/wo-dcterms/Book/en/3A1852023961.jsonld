            "abstract": "\"The concepts of the Electron Statistics (ES) and the ES dependent electronic properties are basic pillars in semiconductor electronics and this first-of-its-kind book deals with the said concepts in doping superlattices (SLs), quantum well, quantum wire and quantum dot SLs, effective mass SLs, SLs with graded interfaces and Fibonacci SLs under different physical conditions respectively. The influences of intense radiation and strong electric fields under said concepts have been considered together with the heavily doped SLs in this context on the basis of newly formulated the electron energy spectra in all the cases. We have suggested experimental determinations of the Einstein relation for the Diffusivity-Mobility ratio, the Debye screening length, Elastic Constants and the content of this book finds 25 different applications in the arena of nanoscience and nanotechnology. This book contains hundred open research problems which form the integral part of the text and are useful for both PhD aspirants and researchers. It is written for post graduate students of various departments of different academic organizations, engineers and professionals in the fields of solid state electronics, materials science, solid state sciences, nano-science, nanotechnology and nano materials in general\"--",

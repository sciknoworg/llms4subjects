                "\"Shows engineers how to prevent wear and dramatically increase the lifespan of key componentsThe critical parts of a heavy duty engine are designed for infinite life without mechanical fatigue failure. Yet the life of an engine is in reality determined by wear of the critical parts. Even if an engine is reconditioned at the end of normal wear life, abnormal wear takes place either due to special working conditions or increased loading. Understanding abnormal and normal wear enables the engineer to control the external conditions leading to premature wear, or to design the critical parts that have longer life and hence lower costs. The literature on wear phenomenon related to engines is scattered in numerous periodicals and books. For the first time, the tribology aspects of different critical engine components are written in one book. Lakshminarayanan covers tribology of critical components, namely, the liner, piston, rings, valve, valve train and bearings with methods to identify and quantify wear. Presents real world case studies with suitable mathematical models for earth movers, power generation, and sea going vessels Includes material from researchers at Chevron (USA), Tekniker (Spain), IP Rings (India), Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd (India) Wear simulations and calculations included in the appendices Instructor presentations slides with book figures available from the companion site \"--"

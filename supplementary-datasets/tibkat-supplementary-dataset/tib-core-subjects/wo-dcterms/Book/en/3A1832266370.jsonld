            "abstract": "The article addresses textual decisions made by \u010cechov's editors in publishing his early short stories. We demonstrate that choices made by other editors and translators has depended crucially on the configuration of his texts found in academic editions of \u010cechov's Complete Works. Specifically, in the volumes that these editions devote to the young \u010cechov, editors place what are in fact the first versions of these short stories in the critical appendix, while furnishing as the featured examples of these texts' versions that \u010cechov had reviewed and retouched for collections published during his lifetime. As a result, works of the \"young \u010cechov\" are often actually works of the \"mature \u010cechov\", a situation that has led to a worldwide misunderstanding",

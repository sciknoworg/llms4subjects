                "Along with almost a hundred research communications this volume contains six invited lectures of lasting value. They cover modeling in plasma dynamics, the use of parallel computing for simulations and the applications of multigrid methods to Navier-Stokes equations, as well as other surveys on important techniques. An inaugural talk on computational fluid dynamics and a survey that relates dynamical systems, turbulence and numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations give an exciting view on scientific computing and its importance for engineering, physics and mathematics",

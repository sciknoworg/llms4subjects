            "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background: Kenya\u2019s recent reforms have introduced a more comprehensive system of checks and balances, including accountability and transparency in expenditure control and management. In this context, the new government has taken decisive steps towards devolution supported by a renovated institutional framework and solid macroeconomic management. Fiscal policy has focused on sustainability, while allowing for infrastructure investment in key sectors such as roads and power generation, and expanding protection of the vulnerable population. Policies have laid the ground for sustainable economic growth, with domestic and foreign investors expanding their scale of operations in a market-friendly environment.

The authorities\u2019 primary fiscal balance outcome was in line with the program, and Priority social expenditure was above the program\u2019s indicative target. The structural benchmark on auditing of compliance with VAT obligations by 50 large taxpayers before June 2013 was fulfilled, and the VAT Act was approved by the Parliament and enacted by the President.

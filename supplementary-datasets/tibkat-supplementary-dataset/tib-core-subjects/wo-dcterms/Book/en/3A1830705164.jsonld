            "abstract": "\"This informative book, Intelligent Technologies for Sensors: Applications, Design, and Optimization for a Smart World, provides an overview of the application of sensors in a variety of intelligent systems and machines. It looks at their diverse applications and uses, their design and architecture, and optimization technologies. Chapters discuss new research in sensors in several fields, such as health care, education, smart homes, agriculture. Sensor devices that are flexible and printable have received a lot of interest in recent years. New techniques such as printing and additive manufacturing are being developed to realize a wide range of readily deployable systems such as displays, sensors, and RFID tags. This volume addresses the need for sophisticated computing technologies in smart real-time world applications. This book brings together leading academics, architects, and scientists from across the globe who are experts in this area. Chapters on sensors in health care in the volume include wearable devices for various health applications, such as ECG signaling, e-health monitoring, web-based ECG signal monitoring, design of materials (such as electronic skin) for prosthetics, Other applications include smart devices for security and home automation, identification for visually impaired persons, IoT-based teaching assistant systems for smart classrooms, online education systems, drones for agricultural field monitoring and pesticide detection, monitoring overhead distribution lines for faults, intelligent transportation systems, human brain signals analysis, intelligent transportation system, and much more. The volume also looks at design methods, such as the Legendre neural network method, the use of specific particulates filled epoxy composites, design and optimization of low-cost rf energy harvesting circuits, and more. The 22 chapters in this book address a broad range of intelligent technology in sensor use and design that will be a welcome resource for those at the forefront of the field\"--",

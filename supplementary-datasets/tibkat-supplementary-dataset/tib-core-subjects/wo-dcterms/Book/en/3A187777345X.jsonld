            "abstract": "This book is a vital resource for promoting transformation and radical change in academia, offering perspectives, strategies and approaches that can be used in addressing persistent gender inequities in the field. Readers from all walks of life can glean valuable lessons from this remarkable work, allowing them to be inspired and empowered\u201d Prof Olive Shisana, CEO of Evidence Based Solutions and Honorary Professor, University of Cape Town. There are limited books on real-life experiences of women in the workplace let alone in academia for women, by women, with women. This book is the first of its kind as it contains a unique collection of 16 powerful and inspiring stories of success and struggle of women in academia across age groups, career stages, disciplines, and geographies, that will never leave you the same. It offers a platform for validating African women\u2019s experiences and heeding their voices which are hardly given any audience in many spaces. You will experience a mixed set of emotions as you celebrate women\u2019s resilience, contributions made, and valuable insights shared, but also realize the dehumanizing experiences that women had to go through, and the extraordinary effort it took for them to survive and thrive in non-diverse academic environments. The book offers multiple perspectives, diverse experiences, and rich lessons derived from challenges experienced, and strategies employed, to empower the next generation. Further, the book goes beyond simply highlighting women\u2019s struggles; it also calls for a bold and radical call to change the status quo so that future generations don\u2019t have to go through the same turmoil. The insights provided in this book have implications for attracting, advancing, and retaining African women in academia.

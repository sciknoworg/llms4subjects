            "abstract": "\"Cross Country Pipeline Risk Assessments and Mitigation Strategies describes the process of pipeline risk management and hazard identification, using qualitative risk assessment, consequence modeling/evaluation, pipeline failure rates, and risk calculations, as well as risk mitigation and control strategies. The book evaluates potential causes of pipeline failure in the oil and gas industry based on a wide range of data that cover more than 40 years of operating history. Additionally, it details a consistent approach that allows for proper estimation of potential risk and offers methods for mitigating this potential risk. This approach is then combined with consequence modeling to fully calculate the different forms of risk presented by pipelines. Cross Country Pipeline Risk Assessments and Mitigation Strategies is an essential resource for professionals and experts involved in pipeline design as well as researchers and students studying risk assessment, particularly in relation to pipelines.Offers a practical risk assessment model for pipelines without the need for complicated, expensive software. Describes a new and systematic approach for pipeline risk control and mitigation that reflects actual pipeline conditions and operating status. Provides examples of all pipeline hazard identification techniques and how they are used to produce consistent results. Includes access to a newly developed Excel tool PipeFAIT for assessing pipeline risk\"--",

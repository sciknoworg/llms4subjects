            "abstract": "The latest Grist Anthology is an innovative blend of some of the most exciting and freshest voices in prose today. Protest is the distillation of a simple human experience - to witness a wrong being done, and to do something about it. The stories featured in Trouble celebrate protest, rebellion, disobedience and general bloody-mindedness in all of its forms.  The best writing about protest should inspire, educate, motivate, compel and of course, entertain. And that\u2019s what this collection is all about.  There are historical protest stories here \u2013 The Flag, Happy Harpies \u2013 stories set in the future \u2013 Money Bank, Last of Them \u2013 stories of personal protest against sexual and racial discrimination \u2013 Meet Me, The Walk of Blood \u2013 and the closing story, The Calling,  which embodies the simple truth that sometimes all you can do in protest is to make a lot of noise",

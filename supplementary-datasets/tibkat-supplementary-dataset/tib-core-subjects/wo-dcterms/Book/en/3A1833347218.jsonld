            "abstract": "This book covers recent developments on fuzzy logic, neural networks and optimization algorithms, as well as their hybrid combinations. In addition, the above-mentioned methods are applied to areas such as intelligent control and robotics, pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, time series prediction and optimization of complex problems. Nowadays, the main topic of the book is highly relevant, as most current intelligent systems and devices in use utilize some form of intelligent feature to enhance their performance. In addition, on the theoretical side, new and advanced models and algorithms of type-2 and type-3 fuzzy logic are presented, which are of great interest to researchers working on these areas. Also, new nature-inspired optimization algorithms and innovative neural models are put forward in the manuscript, which are very popular subjects, at this moment. There are contributions on theoretical aspects as well as applications, which make the book very appealing to a wide audience, ranging from researchers to professors and graduate students",

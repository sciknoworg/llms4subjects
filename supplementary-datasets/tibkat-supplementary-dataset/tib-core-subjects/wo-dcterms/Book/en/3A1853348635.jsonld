            "abstract": "Digital health, virtual assistance, and telemedicine are terms often used interchangeably to refer to remote medical assistance, monitoring and care. Several studies and insights have developed these issues, analyzing the advantages and disadvantages and successes and failures and offering reflections on the implications and issues of these technologies in the health domain. The results of these investigations are affecting the redesign of hospital and outpatient management based on digital innovation using eHealth and mHealth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this approach made it possible to offer assistance and continue care at home, protecting patients, preserving health workers, limiting the spread of the virus, and reducing the need for hospitalization. This reprint contains contributions dealing with the development of DH during the COVID-19 pandemic. The contributions are from various experts in different fields regarding the application of digital health, which, in some cases is also integrated with artificial intelligence, including digital contact tracing, mHealth, virtual reality, mental health, physiology, and rehabilitation",

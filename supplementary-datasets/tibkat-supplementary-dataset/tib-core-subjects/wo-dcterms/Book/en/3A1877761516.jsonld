            "abstract": "The idea of simulating the brain was the goal of many pioneering works in Artificial Intelligence. The brain has been seen as a neural network, or a set of nodes, or neurons, connected by communication lines. Currently, there has been increasing interest in the use of neural network models. This book contains chapters on basic concepts of artificial neural networks, recent connectionist architectures and several successful applications in various fields of knowledge, from assisted speech therapy to remote sensing of hydrological parameters, from fabric defect classification to application in civil engineering. This is a current book on Artificial Neural Networks and Applications, bringing recent advances in the area to the reader interested in this always-evolving machine learning technique",

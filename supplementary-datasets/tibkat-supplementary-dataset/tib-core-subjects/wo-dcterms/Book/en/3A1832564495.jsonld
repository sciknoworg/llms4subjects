            "abstract": "The Management Action Record (MAR) provides Management's annual self-assessment of WBG-wide progress in implementing recommendations from IEG's major evaluations to deliver outcomes in key priority areas. The MAR is an important vehicle for monitoring the uptake of IEG evaluations; it aims to ensure that recommendations lead to targeted actions that help shape the WBG's strategic directions, improve its development effectiveness, and ultimately help countries achieve their development goals. This year's MAR report provides updates on 55 recommendations from 18 IEG evaluations issued between FY18 and FY21, covering a diverse range of areas of strategic importance to the WBG. Building on progress achieved over the previous reporting cycles since the 2020 MAR Reform, this year's MAR update introduces several new features to strengthen its outcome orientation, learning focus, and grounding in higher quality evidence. During this year's MAR update cycle, Management has introduced a more intensive engagement approach to enhance the MAR's learning focus and build understanding between evaluators and technical staff. This has included the facilitation of 23 evaluation-specific working meetings, involving over 120 participants from across the WBG, with representation from all relevant WB Global Practices and IFC regional and industry teams. This year's MAR report has improved the quality of evidence provided to show action and progress in achieving outcomes in response to evaluations, using sentinel indicators to demonstrate a delta change, where possible, since the evaluation period",

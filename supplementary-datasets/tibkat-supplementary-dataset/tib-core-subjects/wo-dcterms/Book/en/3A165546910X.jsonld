The presentation is smooth, the choice of topics optimal, and the book can be profitably used for self teaching.\" --- The Bulletin of Mathematical Books (review of 1st edition) \"A thorough, modern, and lucid treatment of the differential topology, geometry, and global analysis needed to begin advanced study of research in these areas.\" --- Choice (review of 1st edition) \"Probably the most outstanding novelty..is the appropriate selection of topics.\" --- Mathematical Reviews (review of 1st edition) The basics of differentiable manifolds, global calculus, differential geometry, and related topics constitute a core of information essential for the first or second year graduate student preparing for advanced courses and seminars in differential topology and geometry. Differentiable Manifolds is a text designed to cover this material in a careful and sufficiently detailed manner, presupposing only a good foundation in general topology, calculus, and modern algebra. This second edition contains a significant amount of new material, which, in addition to classroom use, will make it a useful reference text. Topics that can be omitted safely in a first course are clearly marked, making this edition easier to use for such a course, as well as for private study by non-specialists wishing to survey the field. The themes of linearization, (re) integration, and global versus local calculus are emphasized throughout. Additional features include a treatment of the elements of multivariable calculus, formulated to adapt readily to the global context, an exploration of bundle theory, and a further (optional) development of Lie theory than is customary in textbooks at this level. New to this edition is a detailed treatment of covering spaces and the fundamental group. Students, teachers and professionals in mathematics and mathematical physics should find this a most stimulating and useful text",

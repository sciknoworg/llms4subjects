            "abstract": "The \u2018knowledge turn\u2019 in curriculum studies has drawn attention to the central role that knowledge of the disciplines plays in education, and to the need for new thinking about how we understand knowledge and knowledge-building. Knowing History in Schools explores these issues in the context of teaching and learning history through a dialogue between the eminent sociologist of curriculum Michael Young, and leading figures in history education research and practice from a range of traditions and contexts. With a focus on Young\u2019s \u2018powerful knowledge\u2019 theorisation of the curriculum, and on his more recent articulations of the \u2018powers\u2019 of knowledge, this dialogue explores the many complexities posed for history education by the challenge of building children\u2019s historical knowledge and understanding. The book builds towards a clarification of how we can best conceptualise knowledge-building in history education. Crucially, it aims to help history education students, history teachers, teacher educators and history curriculum designers navigate the challenges that knowledge-building processes pose for learning history in schools",

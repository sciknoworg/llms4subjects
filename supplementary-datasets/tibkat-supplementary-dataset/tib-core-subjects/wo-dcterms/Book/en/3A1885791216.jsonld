            "abstract": "Sexual education is a worldwide concern that intersects with various attitudes, values, and cultural norms. It is an area of life that has for many years been kept private, but now there is recognition that there is a need to support people, especially young people in modern societies. The way sexual education is taught and applied within institutions shapes the way we understand and approach human sexuality. Various societies have chosen various means to provide sexual education both at school and to the wider society. There is still much more development and support needed, however. We can begin to identify strategies for overcoming challenges in sex education, promoting healthier attitudes, and empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their own bodies and relationships. This book is organized into three sections. The first section focuses on issues in sexual education, such as sexual harassment, sexuality and relationship education and advocacy by people with disabilities, future challenges, and sex differences in physical attractiveness. The second section focuses on the means of sexual health education interventions, including the use of technology. The last section includes a chapter on sex education and the invisibility of intersex people in the curriculum",

Chapter 1 outlines the main macro and sectoral challenges which underpins the rationale for carrying out the agriculture public expenditure review (PER). Chapter 2 outlines the methodological aspects, key sectoral policies/strategies/targets; analyses of agricultural expenditure levels/trends, composition, relevant measures of efficiency, effectiveness and value of money; and criteria for defining the scope of the study. Chapter 3 outlines the Government's budgetary cycle, processes and practices based on relevant budgetary decrees/circulars that guide budgetary priorities and allocations for annual and medium-term agricultural sector expenditure, and management aspects. Chapter 4 conducts a backward assessment through an analyses of the levels, trends, composition, and performance of agricultural including the efficiency, effectiveness and emerging results of agricultural public expenditure, for the period 2013 - 2017. Chapter 5 synthesizes the expenditure performance of three strategic programs: agricultural technology, irrigation, and aspects related to decentralization and adaptation to climate change. Chapter 6 highlights the role, scope, levels/trends and sources of private sector financing in the agricultural sector, and their key determinants. Chapter 7 takes a forward-looking approach to the expenditure assessment by outlining: (a) key elements and emerging issues; (b) the approach used for estimating and using their medium-term expenditure framework; (c) good practices; and (d) alignment between the forward sectoral expenditure and priority agricultural sector policies and targets. Chapter 8 synthesizes the main findings and priority recommendations in the form of a roadmap, including a supporting proposed results-focused agriculture expenditure action plan",

                "This book examines what the justification of political power and the character of a liberal political community in the conditions of pluralism should look like, with the aim of equal respect for all. Sylvie Bl\u00e1hov\u00e1 argues that if those who understand the principle of respect as the basis of political liberalism are to fulfill all the prerequisites of this principle, they must ensure respect within the liberal political community as a whole. The classic interpretation of political liberalism ensures respect during the process of justification of political power, yet many individuals in the liberal political community remain disrespected, mainly due to their group membership. Accordingly, Bl\u00e1hov\u00e1 looks for a more complex interpretation of the principle of respect within political liberalism, one that ensures respect beyond the justification of political power. The author argues that the way to achieve respect in the liberal political community is to interpret the criterion of reciprocity in a dual way. Specifically, Bl\u00e1hov\u00e1 claims that respect can be ensured only only in conjunction with the principle of civic friendship, which makes respect more comprehensive. This novel interpretation can ensure unity of the liberal political community and make it stable, which is crucial in conditions of pluralism. Sylvie Bl\u00e1hov\u00e1 is Assistant Professor at the Department of Political Science, Philosophical Faculty, University of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Czechia. ."

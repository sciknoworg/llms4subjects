            "abstract": "Managing people is the chief task of human resources officers in businesses and industries worldwide. It is a difficult and demanding task, especially in this era of highly dynamic and constantly changing business environments. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic led to major and perhaps irreversible changes in how people work and how businesses operate. This book provides a comprehensive overview of what it means to manage people in the modern world. It includes sixteen chapters organized into three sections: \u201cPeople Management in a VUCA World\u201d, \u201cA Bright Future for People Management\u201d, and \u201cPeople Management for People Happiness\u201d. Chapters address such topics as dealing with staff turnover, human resource development strategies during and post-crisis, diversity management, the relationship between career development and value proposition, the happy-productive worker thesis (HPWT), and much more",

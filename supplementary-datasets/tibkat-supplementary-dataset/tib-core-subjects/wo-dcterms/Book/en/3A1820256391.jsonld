            "abstract": "This paper investigate the consequences of forced displacement using a panel of households that were surveyed during the Republic of Yemen's conflict both before and after they became displaced. It demonstrates that forced displacement resulted in an immediate but temporary decline in food access. Pre- and post-displacement food access outcomes were indistinguishable within four months of displacement and, for later months, there were no economically large declines in food access. The quick rebound is partially explained by an increase in assistance to displaced households that had worse food access prior to displacement. Households that were slightly better off prior to displacement did not receive an increase in assistance. These are the first estimates that directly address how non-security dimensions of well-being change immediately following forced displacement and demonstrate that, in some contexts, forcibly displaced households are more resilient than is typically assumed",

            "abstract": "In this chapter, novel attack\u2010aware routing and wavelength assignment (Aa\u2010RWA) algorithms for multiperiod network planning are proposed. The considered physical layer attacks addressed in this chapter are high\u2010power jamming attacks. These attacks are modeled as interactions among lightpaths as a result of intra\u2010channel and/or inter\u2010channel crosstalk. The proposed Aa\u2010RWA algorithm first solves the problem for given traffic demands, and subsequently, the algorithm is enhanced in order to deal with demands under uncertainties. The demand uncertainty is considered in order to provide a solution for several periods, where the knowledge of demands for future periods can only be estimated. The objective of the Aa\u2010RWA algorithm is to minimize the impact of possible physical layer attacks and at the same time minimize the investment cost (in terms of switching equipment deployed) during the network planning phase",

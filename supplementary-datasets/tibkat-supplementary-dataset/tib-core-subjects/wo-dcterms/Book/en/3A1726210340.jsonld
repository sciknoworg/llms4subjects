                "\"Carotenoids are a large class of isoprenoid pigments produced by plants and certain microbes. More than 700 naturally occurring carotenoids have been identified. Apocarotenoids are tailored from carotenoids by oxidative enzymes. Apocarotenoids act as visual or volatile signals to attract pollinating and seed dispersal agents. They are also the key players in allelopathic interactions and plant defense. Biology, Chemistry and Applications of Apocarotenoids provides detailed account of the fundamental chemistry of apocarotenoids and the basic methods used in carotenoid research, and critical discussions of the biochemistry, functions, and applications of these important compounds. Topics covered in the proposed book include various aspects of the roles of apocarotenoids in colour and colouration, photosynthesis and other photofunctions and protection. The formation and roles of carotenoid metabolites and breakdown products as perfume/aroma compounds are also be outlined. Features: Provides an organized overview of apocarotenoids and their chemistry and biological functions Focuses on recent discoveries on apocarotenoids, their nature and functions. Details potential uses of apocarotenoids in agriculture, pharmacy, food industry, and apocarotenoid production at industrial level This book has been written by leading experts in apocarotenoid research and gives a comprehensive overview on the diversity of apocarotenoid compounds and would serve as a reference book for researches in Plant Physiology, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Biophysics and Medicine\"--"

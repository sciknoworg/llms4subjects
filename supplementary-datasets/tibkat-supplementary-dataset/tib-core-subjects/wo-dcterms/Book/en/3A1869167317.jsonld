With the increasing attention paid to sustainable development around the world, improving energy efficiency and applying effective means of energy saving have gradually received worldwide attention. As the largest energy consumers, manufacturing industries also inevitably face pressures on energy optimization evolution from both governments and competitors. The rational optimization of energy consumption in industrial operation activities can significantly improve the sustainability level of an entire company",

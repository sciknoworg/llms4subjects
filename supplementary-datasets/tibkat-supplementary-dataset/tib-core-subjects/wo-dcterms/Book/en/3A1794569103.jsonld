Likewise, aspects such as modeling of degradation processes and new materials synthesis were published, aiming to improve, optimize and predict the efficacy of the existing or the novel treatment processes. Moreover, pilot plant operation and large-scale processes were featured, assessing the feasibility of these new treatment methods in real world applications. Overall, the Special Issue and this book present innovative solutions on the field of water and wastewater treatment, with a view on the future technologies that will form the next advances of the field",

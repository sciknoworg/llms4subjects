                "The Very Long Game, the first open access comparative study on the current state of defense AI, provides a succinct overview across 25 nations, analyzing six fundamental lines of effort: thinking, developing, organizing, funding, deploying, and training. Written by expert analysts and practitioners, The Very Long Game compellingly blends theoretical with practical insight and sets the standard for comparative defense AI analyses. Military leaders, industry experts, and scholars will greatly benefit from reading this book. Gen (ret) John Allen Former Commander of the NATO International Security Assistance Force and US Forces in Afghanistan, past President of The Brookings Institution, and Strategic Advisor to the Microsoft Corporation A most timely comparative study, rich in empirical analysis, that examines the \u201cdrivers, pace and priorities\u201d of defense AI. This volume is a vital resource for anyone interested in military innovation and defense transformation. Prof. Theo Farrell, PhD President and Vice-Chancellor, La Trobe University The Very Long Game is an absolute must-have for everyone interested in defense AI! One of the book\u2019s key strengths is the unitary analytical framework, which makes the detailed case studies easily accessible and provides insightful findings on cross-regional commonalities and differences.

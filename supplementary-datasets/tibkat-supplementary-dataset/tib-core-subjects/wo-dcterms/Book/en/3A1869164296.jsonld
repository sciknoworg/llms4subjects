            "abstract": "Understanding the interconnection between energy, the environment, and the economy is critical in contemporary society. The relationship between energy consumption, economic growth, and the environment has garnered significant attention from researchers and policymakers alike, and understanding the underlying causal connection between energy and the economy is crucial for modeling effective environmental and growth policies. Moreover, the emergence of new energy and environmental policies would create a plethora of further research opportunities in this evolving climate regime. For instance, several countries prioritize projects focused on energy efficiency, as they are considered low-risk, no-regret options that may yield economic benefits. In a nutshell, this Special Issue aims to address a gap in the existing literature by providing an in-depth analysis of the interplay between energy, the environment, and the economy, emphasizing the exploration of the potential environmental impacts of energy consumption and economic growth",

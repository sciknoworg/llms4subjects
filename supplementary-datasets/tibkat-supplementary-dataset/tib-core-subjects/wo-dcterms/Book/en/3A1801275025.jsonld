                "\u201cLong regarded as one of the most gifted analysts of Muslim culture and politics in Indonesia, Sumanto Al Qurtuby in this new book extends his gaze to analyze the causes and consequences of religious extremism in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, as well as the efforts undertaken by government and societal organizations in both countries to counter such currents. The result is a rare achievement in contemporary scholarship: a book that simultaneously demonstrates a profound understanding of Islam and society in these two important countries, while also speaking with clarity and insight to policy analysts and security experts.\u201d \u2014Robert Hefner, Professor of Anthropology and Global Affairs, Pardee School of Global Affairs, Boston University, Boston, USA This book is a comparative study of terrorism and counterterrorism in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. It explores the history and contemporary developments of terrorism, especially Islamist terrorism, in these two Sunni Muslim-majority countries. In doing so, it analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of governments\u2019 policies, strategies, and models of counterterrorism, including terrorist rehabilitation and reintegration programs. In addition, the book also documents the opinions of Saudis and Indonesians to find societal voices on effective ways of combating violent extremism and discusses Saudi-Indonesian cooperation on counterterrorism, defense, and security issues. The book suggests that although particular Islamic texts, teachings, and discourses might influence radical behaviors and practices of some Muslim individuals and groupings, terrorism is beyond ideological, religious, and doctrinal issues. Therefore, multiple methods and strategies are needed to combat radicalism and create sustainable peace in society. The work will be is beneficial for both academic and non-academic communities, particularly students of conflict, violence, peacebuilding, and religious studies. Sumanto Al Qurtuby is an associate professor of Cultural Anthropology in the Department of Global Studies and an affiliate of the IRC for Finance & Digital Economy, KFUPM Business School, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals. He holds a Ph.D. from Boston University and was a former fellow at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at University of Notre Dame and the Middle East Institute of National University of Singapore. He is the author of Religious Violence and Conciliation in Indonesia (2016) and Saudi Arabia and Indonesian Networks: Migration, Education and Islam (2019).",

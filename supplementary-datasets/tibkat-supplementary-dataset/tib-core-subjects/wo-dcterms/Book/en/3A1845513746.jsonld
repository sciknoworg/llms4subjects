                "The question of reconstructing a geometric shape from spectra of operators (such as the Laplace operator) is decades old and an active area of research in mathematics and mathematical physics. This book focusses on the case of compact Riemannian manifolds, and, in particular, the question whether one can find finitely many natural operators that determine whether two such manifolds are isometric (coverings). The methods outlined in the book fit into the tradition of the famous work of Sunada on the construction of isospectral, non-isometric manifolds, and thus do not focus on analytic techniques, but rather on algebraic methods: in particular, the analogy with constructions in number theory, methods from representation theory, and from algebraic topology. The main goal of the book is to present the construction of finitely many \u201ctwisted\u201d Laplace operators whose spectrum determines covering equivalence of two Riemannian manifolds. The book has a leisure pace and presents details and examples that are hard to find in the literature, concerning: fiber products of manifolds and orbifolds, the distinction between the spectrum and the spectral zeta function for general operators, strong isospectrality, twisted Laplacians, the action of isometry groups on homology groups, monomial structures on group representations, geometric and group-theoretical realisation of coverings with wreath products as covering groups, and \u201cclass field theory\u201d for manifolds. The book contains a wealth of worked examples and open problems. After perusing the book, the reader will have a comfortable working knowledge of the algebraic approach to isospectrality. This is an open access book."

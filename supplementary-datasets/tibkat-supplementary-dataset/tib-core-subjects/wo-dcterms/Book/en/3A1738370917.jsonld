            "abstract": "\"The algal industry is perhaps one of the least understood sectors of the world's aquaculture. Certainly, its economic and commercial aspects are among the most poorly documented. Yet it is an industry of considerable and, in many instances, rapidly growing proportions, with a total commercial value approaching US$6.0 billion per annum. The bio-refinery approach is proposed as a sustainable strategy to achieve this goal. There are many emerging technologies available to process algae, but optimization and more efficient developments are still required. Therefore, sustainable supply (without impacting the environment) along with increasing requirement of novel processing and extraction techniques for exploring and harnessing the immense potential of algae formed the premise of this book. There is thus a need to document not only the traditional ways to extract algal bioactives, but also to know how novel processes that can be exploited industrially. Finding all this information in one expert monograph has been problematical, which explains why hitherto there has never been a comprehensive book that covers health and nutraceutical aspects of algae\"--",

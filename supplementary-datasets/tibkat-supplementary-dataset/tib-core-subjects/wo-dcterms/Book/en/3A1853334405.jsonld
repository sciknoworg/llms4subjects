            "abstract": "In Stanley Corngold\u2019s view, the themes and strategies of Kafka\u2019s fiction are generated by a tension between his concern for writing and his growing sense of its arbitrary character. Analyzing Kafka\u2019s work in light of \"the necessity of form,\" which is also a merely formal necessity, Corngold uncovers the fundamental paradox of Kafka\u2019s art and life. The first section of the book shows how Kafka\u2019s rhetoric may be understood as the daring project of a man compelled to live his life as literature. In the central part of the book, Corngold reflects on the place of Kafka within the modern tradition, discussing such influential precursors of Cervantes, Flaubert, and Nietzsche, whose works display a comparable narrative disruption. Kafka\u2019s distinctive narrative strategies, Corngold points out, demand interpretation at the same time they resist it. Critics of Kafka, he says, must be aware that their approaches are guided by the principles that Kafka\u2019s fiction identifies, dramatizes, and rejects. ; In Stanley Corngold\u2019s view, the themes and strategies of Kafka\u2019s fiction are generated by a tension between his concern for writing and his growing sense of its arbitrary character.

            "abstract": "The last few decades have seen rapid development in the field of surface engineering and its applications in almost all industrial sectors. Tribological coatings, which are an important aspect of surface engineering, are today applied on machine component surfaces for a diverse range of moving machine components to control (mostly to minimize) friction and wear in order to conserve energy and materials. This reprint book is a compilation of 11 research papers contributed by experts in the field of surface engineering and tribology. These papers have dealt with the synthesis of various types of coatings, characterization and applications under different operating conditions. It is hoped that this reprint book will be of interest, not only to researchers, but also to practicing engineers and technologists in the industry",

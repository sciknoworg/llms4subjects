            "title": "Angola Country Economic Memorandum : Towards Economic Diversification",
            "abstract": "The Angolan economy is at a significant juncture. The current growth model based on oil wealth is nearly exhausted and has not delivered inclusive growth and shared prosperity. Angola faces two broad policy challenges that need to be addressed urgently: macroeconomic stabilization and a more inclusive economic growth. The internal and external imbalances following the adjustment to lower oil prices pose a challenge to macro-stabilization. The prospect of volatile oil prices and potentially diminishing oil reserves over the medium and long-term call for a new sustainable and inclusive growth model that promotes economic diversification, a model that is less dependent on natural resource exports. The new administration is aware of these challenges and has started to implement much needed reforms. Angola is right to focus on reforms that lay the foundation for long-term macroeconomic stability and economic diversification. Analyses conducted as part of this report indicate that there are significant gains to be had from such reforms. The objective of this report on Angola is to support policy makers in their reform efforts. The report is organized as follows: Chapter 1 takes stock of recent trends and determinants of growth in Angola, highlighting the importance of natural resource wealth and volatility for growth outcomes. Chapter 2 presents the findings of a growth diagnostic for Angola, and highlights low human capital, access to finance, weak institutions and macroeconomic instability as critical and binding constraints for the non-oil economy. Chapter 3 uses product space analysis to evaluate Angola's current and future potential for economic and export diversification, drawing attention to products and services sectors in which there is potential for export upgrading and/or product innovation. Chapter 4 provides an overview of the agriculture sector and assesses its potential for economic diversification. Chapter 5 sets out the way forward, identifying: critical reforms for macroeconomic stability; a fiscal framework for natural-resource wealth management; and macro-financial stability",

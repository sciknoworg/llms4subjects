            "title": "Evolution of Ionizing Radiation Research",
            "abstract": "The industrial and medical applications of radiation have been augmented and scientific insight into mechanisms for radiation action notably progressed. In addition, the public concern about radiation risk has also grown extensively. Today the importance of risk communication among stakeholders involved in radiation-related issues is emphasized much more than any time in the past. Thus, the circumstances of radiation research have drastically changed, and the demand for a novel approach to radiation-related issues is increasing. It is thought that the publication of the book Evolution of Ionizing Radiation Research at this time would have enormous impacts on the society. The editor believes that technical experts would find a variety of new ideas and hints in this book that would be helpful to them to tackle ionizing radiation",

Building on the third edition, this text applies the latest data and research in the field, and addresses water contamination as a growing problem. The book material covers a wide range of water contaminants, the cause of these contaminants, and considers their impact on surface water and groundwater sources. It also explores sustainability and the effects of human use, misuse, and reuse of freshwater and wastewater on the overall water supply. Provides Valuable Insight for Water/Wastewater Practitioners Designed to fill a gap in the available material about water, the book examines water reserve utilization and the role of policymakers involved in the decision-making process. The book provides practical knowledge that practitioners and operators must have in order to pass licensure/certification tests and keep up with relevant changes. It also updates all previous chapters, presents numerous example math problems, and provides information not covered in earlier editions. Features: Updated throughout, and adds new problems, tables, and figures Includes new coverage on persistent chemicals in drinking water and the latest techniques in converting treated wastewater to safe drinking water Provides updated information on pertinent regulations dealing with important aspects of water supply and treatment The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications, Fourth Edition serves a varied audience-it can be utilized by water/wastewater practitioners-as well as students, lay personnel, regulators, technical experts, attorneys, business leaders, and concerned citizens\"--",

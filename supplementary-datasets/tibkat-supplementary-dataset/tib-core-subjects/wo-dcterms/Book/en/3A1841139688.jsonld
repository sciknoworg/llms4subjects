            "abstract": "In The Celluloid Specimen, Benjam\u00edn Schultz\u2011Figueroa examines rarely seen behaviorist films of animal experiments from the 1930s and 1940s. These laboratory recordings\u2014including Robert Yerkes\u2019s work with North American primate colonies, Yale University\u2019s rat\u2011based simulations of human society, and B. F. Skinner\u2019s promotions for pigeon\u2011guided missiles\u2014have long been considered passive records of scientific research. In Schultz\u2011Figueroa\u2019s incisive analysis, however, they are revealed to be rich historical, political, and aesthetic texts that played a crucial role in American scientific and cultural history\u2014and remain foundational to contemporary conceptions of species, race, identity, and society. \u201cEssential reading for anyone in behavioral science and media studies.\u201d \u2014 LISA CARTWRIGHT, University of California, San Diego \u201cRemarkable and urgently needed. Benjam\u00edn Schultz\u2011Figueroa disinters an extraordinary lost archive that sheds new light on race, eugenics, species, the science of sex, and biopolitics. A resonant\u2014 and stunningly clear\u2014intervention.\u201d \u2014 DONOVAN SCHAEFER, author of Wild Experiment: Feeling Science and Secularism after Darwin \u201cA fertile, sprawling, kaleidoscopic work. No book outlines the multiple functions of the scientific moving image as thoroughly. A brilliant and essential addition to animal studies, cinema and media studies, and the history of science.\u201d \u2014 SCOTT CURTIS, author of The Shape of Spectatorship: Art, Science, and Early Cinema in Germany \u201cSeriously speculative, meticulously researched, and boldly interdisciplinary, The Celluloid Specimen cross\u2011pollinates nontheatrical film studies and critical animal studies with stunning acumen and gripping analysis.\u201d \u2014 YIMAN WANG, University of California, Santa Cruz",

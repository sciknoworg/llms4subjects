            "abstract": "Pakistan is at a critical decision point. While there have been recent important examples of reform progress, economic policies over past years and decades have had overall negative impacts on sustainability, productivity, and investment. As Pakistan has fallen behind its peers, progress with poverty reduction has ceased. Human development outcomes remain dire, while the benefits of growth have accrued disproportionately to a narrow elite. Amid continued rapid population growth and a youth bulge, a growing number of young Pakistanis are frustrated by the lack of opportunities, with prospects for young women especially bleak. Pakistan is among the countries most impacted by climate change, and recent events, including the 2022 floods, have highlighted the urgent need for investment in climate resilience. The economy is now, again, sustained by a short-term International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, inflation is at record highs, the rupee has depreciated sharply, while foreign exchange reserves remain at uncomfortably low levels. Recent policy measures (including the restoration of exchange rate flexibility, subsidy reforms, and movements towards fiscal constraint) have supported economic stabilization, but the underpinning drivers of Pakistan's economic fragility remain to be addressed. This note presents critical policy shifts required to move beyond the current low equilibrium towards sustainable and inclusive economic development and poverty reduction. This note summarizes the accompanying series of policy notes. It: (i) outlines Pakistan's current development challenge; (ii) identifies the critical constraints to faster development progress; (iii) describes the major policy shifts that will be required to address current constraints; and (iv) presents broad principles to guide implementation of required reforms",

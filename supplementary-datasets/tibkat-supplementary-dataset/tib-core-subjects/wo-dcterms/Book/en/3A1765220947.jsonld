The 63 full papers presented together with 16 tool papers and 5 invited papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 290 submissions. The papers were organized in the following topical sections: Part I: invited papers; AI verification; concurrency and blockchain; hybrid and cyber-physical systems; security; and synthesis. Part II: complexity and termination; decision procedures and solvers; hardware and model checking; logical foundations; and software verification."

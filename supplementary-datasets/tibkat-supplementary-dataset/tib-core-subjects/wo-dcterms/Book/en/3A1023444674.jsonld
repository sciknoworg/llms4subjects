                "'This book brings together a wealth of information on a diverse range of corporate wellness programs. Researchers and practitioners alike will benefit from the contributors' evidence-based insights about the design, implementation, success factors and impacts of wellness programs. The book's comprehensive approach highlights the influence of organizational context on employee health and wellness, and at the same time, clearly demonstrates the organizational pay-offs of carefully-designed wellness interventions.'--Graham Lowe, The Graham Lowe Group, Canada. Employee well-being and organizational success are closely linked. In light of this connection, corporate wellness programs have emerged in recent decades as a way to achieve organizational health and success. Corporate Wellness Programs offers contributions from international experts, examining the planning, implementation and evaluation of wellness initiatives in organizations, and offering guidance on how to introduce these programs in to the workplace. Previous research evidence surrounding corporate wellness programs is reviewed, to illustrate reduced health care costs, higher levels of employee well-being, greater work engagement, higher levels of performance, and financial gains on investment costs. Organizational case studies in various countries are explored, highlighting best practice and lessons to be learned from them. This book offers a unique addition to employee and organizational health research, emphasizing both theoretical and empirical examples of best-practice corporate wellness programs. Researchers and academics interested in individual and organizational health will find this book a valuable resource and reference point. Managers and consultants working with organizational health will benefit from the best practice recommendations presented in the book",

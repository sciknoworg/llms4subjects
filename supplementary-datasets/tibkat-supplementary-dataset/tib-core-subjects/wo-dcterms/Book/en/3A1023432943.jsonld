                "'This scholarly and important volume has an impressive interdisciplinary and international scope. We hear from psychologists, sociologists, philosophers, legal scholars, and economists. These refreshing chapters broaden our understanding of human innovation, contributing to a developing sociocultural approach to the study of creativity. These chapters directly challenge the myth of solitary genius, by documenting the social and cultural systems within which new ideas emerge.' - Keith Sawyer, Washington University in St Louis, US. 'This penetrating volume both summarizes compellingly what we know about creativity and examines critically loose concepts of creativity, cases where creativity does harm, and deceptive hype about creativity. This volume neither romanticizes creativity nor reduces it to the servant of economic and cultural development, offering instead a differentiated and penetrating examination of the nature of creativity and its diverse positive and sometimes negative roles.' - David Perkins, Harvard Graduate School of Education, US. This comprehensive yet concise Handbook provides an overview of innovative approaches to, and new perspectives on, the study of creativity. In this timely work, creativity is not defined by an ideal, rather it encompasses a range of theories, functions, characteristics, processes, products and practices that are associated with the generation of novel and useful outcomes suited to particular social, cultural and political contexts. Chapters present original research by international scholars from a wide range of disciplines including history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, cultural studies, education, economics and interdisciplinary studies. Their research investigates creativity in diverse fields including art, creative industries, aesthetics, design, new media, music, arts education, science, engineering and technology. Containing cutting-edge research the Handbook of Research on Creativity will strongly appeal to academics and advanced students in cultural studies, creative industries, art history and theory, experimental music and performance studies, digital and new media studies, engineering, economics, sociology, psychology and social psychology, management studies, and education - particularly visual arts education and music education. Policy makers, managers and entrepreneurs will also find much to interest them in this fascinating work",

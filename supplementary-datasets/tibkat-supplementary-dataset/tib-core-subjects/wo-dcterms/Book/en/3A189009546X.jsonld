                "\u201cThis extraordinary book is a fascinating account of legendary Hong Kong musical duo Tat Ming Pair, but it\u2019s so much more than that too: it\u2019s an analysis of political change in a postcolonial city, and of how much music can matter in situations where spaces for resistance are closed down. Elegantly drawing on cultural theory, it offers an exemplary model for versions of popular music studies that transcend Eurocentrism.\u201d \u2014 David Hesmondhalgh, University of Leeds \u201cMelding empirical data, critical analysis and theoretical discourse, this book contributes an important case which has vast implications for a deepened understanding of the intricate relationship between popular music and politics in not just Hong Kong but also the global context. A must-read for anyone interested in Hong Kong as well as Asian popular music, it has not only showcased the authors\u2019 theoretical acumen, but also demonstrated their special commitment to the popular music of the city.\u201d \u2014 Yiu-Wai Chu, The University of Hong Kong This book is unique in focusing on just one band from one city \u2013 but the story of Tat Ming Pair, in so many ways, is the story of Hong Kong's recent decades, from the Handover to the Umbrella Movement to the social protests in 2019. Empirically rich, theoretically informed, this study of Hong Kong\u2019s past, present and future through the prism of Tat Ming Pair is a timely and daring inquiry of the intricate relationship between politics and pop music.

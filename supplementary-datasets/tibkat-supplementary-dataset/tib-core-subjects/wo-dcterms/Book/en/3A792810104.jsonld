            "abstract": "The basic elements of overhead power line technology have been known for many years. However, this technology has continuously developed, for example, adjusting the design of the lines to new transmission needs and to available rights-of-way, and to accommodate environmental concerns or resources. Since many existing overhead line installations are approaching the end of their economic and technical lifetime, strategies for maintenance to extending their operational life are needed. Also, because of the introduction of new standards and deregulation, the basis of design and verification for all aspects and steps in overhead line planning and construction has changed. The industry, therefore, requires a publication reflecting these developments and changes. Overhead Power Lines present not only the scientific and engineering basis for the electric and mechanical design, but also comprehensively describe all aspects of most recent technology, including the selection and design of components such as conductors, insulators, fittings, supports and foundations. The chapters on line survey, construction and maintenance address updated requirements and solutions. In addition, the book carefully considers the changing economic and technical environment of the overhead power line business. This publication is intended to introduce students and beginners to the full range of relevant topics of line design and implementation, and to serve as a valuable reference to engineers and technicians employed by overhead line operators, contractors and consulting companies to carry out their daily tasks. The book also supplies everyone else in the electric-energy supply industry, including design, maintenance, and construction engineers, with a ready reference. This first English-language edition is based on the 5th German-language edition and incorporates the latest international standards sponsored by Cigr\u00e9, the International Council of Large Electric Systems, IEC and CENELEC. The authors are recognized experts who have long participated in, and actively contributed, to Cigr\u00e9",

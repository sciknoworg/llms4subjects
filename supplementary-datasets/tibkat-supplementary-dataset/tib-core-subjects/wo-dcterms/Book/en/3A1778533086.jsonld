            "abstract": "The first rotor performance predictions were published by Joukowsky exactly 100 years ago. Although a century of research has expanded the knowledge of rotor aerodynamics enormously, and modern computer power and measurement techniques now enable detailed analyses that were previously out of reach, the concepts proposed by Froude, Betz, Joukowsky and Glauert for modelling a rotor in performance calculations are still in use today, albeit with modifications and expansions. This book is the result of the author's curiosity as to whether a return to these models with a combination of mathematics, dedicated computations and wind tunnel experiments could yield more physical insight and answer some of the old questions still waiting to be resolved. Although most of the work included here has been published previously, the book connects the various topics, linking them in a coherent storyline. This book will be of interest to those working in all branches of rotor aerodynamics \u2013 wind turbines, propellers, ship screws and helicopter rotors. It has been written for proficient students and researchers, and reading it will demand a good knowledge of inviscid (fluid) mechanics. Jens N\u00f8rk\u00e6r S\u00f8rensen, DTU, Technical University of Denmark: \u201c(\u2026) a great piece of work, which in a consistent way highlights many of the items that the author has worked on through the years. All in all, an impressive contribution to the classical work on propellers/wind turbines.\u201d Peter Schaffarczyk, Kiel University of Applied Sciences, Germany: \u201c(\u2026) a really impressive piece of work!\u201d Carlos Sim\u00e3o Ferreira, Technical University Delft: \u201cThis is a timely book for a new generation of rotor aerodynamicists from wind turbines to drones and personal air-vehicles. In a time where fast numerical solutions for aerodynamic design are increasingly available, a clear theoretical and fundamental formulation of the rotor-wake problem will help professionals to evaluate the validity of their design problem. \u2018The Fluid Dynamic Basis for Actuator Disc and Rotor Theories\u2019 is a pleasure to read, while the structure, text and figures are just as elegant as the theory presented.\u201d The cover shows \u2018The Red Mill\u2019, by Piet Mondriaan, 1911, collection Gemeentemuseum Den Haag.

            "abstract": "This book reviews the training and practice of teachers from several perspectives. The scientific quality and pedagogical richness of the contributions within make this book indispensable for training and enriching teaching professionalism and is useful for teachers in service as well. The interdisciplinarity that increasingly characterizes the educational and training environment clearly emerges, offering the reader a more articulated and less monotheistic vision. This vision, which at first might be more difficult to interpret and less functional to the educational impact of the text, instead offers the opportunity to build a new interpretative key of the complex educational\u2013didactic and educational\u2013professional phenomenon. Trying to govern a phenomenon rich in variables is a fundamental error; to operate with awareness and conscience, the best way is to go through the complexity of the phenomena and reading this book is, in our opinion, the best cultural weapon",

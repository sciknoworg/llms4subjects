                "This book directs the engineering manager or the undergraduate student preparing to become an engineering manager, who is or will become actively engaged in the management of economic-risk trade-off decisions for engineering investments within an organizational system. In today\u2019s global economy, this may mean managing the economic risks of engineering investments across national boundaries in international organizations, government, or service organizations. As such, this is an applied book. The book\u2019s goal is to provide an easy to understand, up to date, and coherent treatment of the management of the economic-risk trade-offs of engineering investments. This book accomplishes this goal by cumulatively sequencing knowledge content from foundational economic and accounting concepts to cost estimating to the traditional engineering economics knowledge culminating in fundamental engineering managerial economic decision-making incorporating risk into engineering management economic decisions."

            "title": "Climate Risk Country Profile : Turkmenistan",
            "abstract": "Turkmenistan is in the southwestern part of Central Asia and the country is bordered to the north by Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, to the southeast by Afghanistan and to the south by Iran, with the Caspian Sea coastline forming a natural boundary to its west. Turkmenistan's economy has seen a very high rate of growth due to a significant expansion in the export of natural gas, oil and related products, which accounted for the bulk of its exports over this period. However, inequality in income and opportunity are believed to be higher than most countries with a comparable rank. These social issues, combined with the climate extremes experienced, mean that Turkmenistan has significant vulnerability to climate change. This document aims to succinctly summarize the climate risks faced by Turkmenistan. This includes rapid onset and long- term changes in key climate parameters, as well as impacts of these changes on communities, livelihoods and economies, many of which are already underway. Climate change is a major risk to good development outcomes, and the World Bank Group is committed to playing an important role in helping countries integrate climate action into their core development agendas. The World Bank Group (WBG) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are committed to supporting client countries to invest in and build a low-carbon, climate resilient future, helping them to be better prepared to adapt to current and future climate impacts",

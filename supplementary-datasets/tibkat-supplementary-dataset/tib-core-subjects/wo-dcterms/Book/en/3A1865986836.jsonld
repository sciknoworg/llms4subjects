            "abstract": "This report presents the Independent Evaluation Group's validation of the World Bank Group's 2018 capital increase package (CIP). It assesses the World Bank Group's progress in implementing the CIP's policy measures and achieving its targets, as well as the quality of management's CIP reporting. The 2018 CIP boosted the Bank Group's financial firepower with a USD 7.5 billion paid-in capital increase for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), USD 5.5 billion paid-in capital increase for the International Finance Corporation (IFC), USD 52.6 billion callable capital increase for IBRD, and internal savings measures. The CIP also included a policy package that committed Bank Group management to policy actions linked to the Bank Group's 2016 Forward Look strategy. The CIP committed to reporting annually on its implementation and an independent assessment after five years. This report fulfills the commitment to an independent assessment. This validation builds on management's own reporting and other complementary evidence to assess the World Bank Group's progress in implementing the CIP's policy measures and achieving its targets. The report also assesses the quality of management's CIP reporting. The report points to lessons on developing, implementing, and reporting corporate initiatives and commitments, such as the importance of having clear strategies or action plans, explicit buy-in from senior management, and accurate reporting with meaningful indicators and realistic targets",

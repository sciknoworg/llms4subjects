            "abstract": "The rivalry between India and Pakistan began on British withdrawal from the British Indian Empire in 1947, and with the sudden partition of India immediately afterwards. It has proven remarkably resilient. While the countries share a long history and have considerable social\u2013cultural affinity, relations since Partition have been marked by three wars, constant border skirmishes and a deep distrust that permeates both societies. In each, teaching about those relations is weighted with political and cultural significance, and research shows that curriculums have been used to shape the mindset of new generations with regard to their neighbouring state.  This book explores the attitudes and pedagogical  decision-making of teachers in India and Pakistan when teaching India\u2013Pakistan relations. Situating teachers in the context of reformed textbooks and curriculums in  both countries that explicitly advocate  critical thinking and social cohesion, Kusha Anand  explores how far teachers have enacted these changes in their classrooms. Based on data collected from teachers via  semi-structured interviews and classroom observations in India and Pakistan she  argues that, despite whole-nation policies and texts, teaching of India\u2013Pakistan  relations is dependent on the socio-economic status of schools. While there is  progress towards the stated goals, teachers in both countries face pressures from  the interests of school and state, and often miss opportunities to engage with  multiple perspectives and stereotypes in their classrooms",

            "abstract": "Orthopaedic surgery is the widest and the strongest growing surgical specialty. It is clear, that the process of improving treatments and patients care, requires knowledge, and this requires access to studies, expert opinion and books. Unfortunately, the access to this knowledge is being materialized. As we believe that access to the medical knowledge should be reachable to everyone free of charge, this book was generated to cover the orthopaedic aspect. It will provide the reader with a mix of basic, but as well highly specialized knowledge. In the process of editing this book, my wife Jurgita has been, as usual, the most supportive person. I would like to thank her for being in my life. I would like to thank Mr. Greblo, the Publishing Process Manager, for all his help and last but not least thanks to our readers, as without them this book would have no meaning",

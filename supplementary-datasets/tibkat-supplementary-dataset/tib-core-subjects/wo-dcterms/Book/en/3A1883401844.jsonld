            "abstract": "This book is the first academic monograph on the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST, or China&#x2019;s &#x2018;sky eye&#x2019;), which discusses the research on cable-driven and rigid parallel robots in detail. Taking the final scale model of the FAST feed support system as the object, it introduces the theoretical and engineering research on optimal design, accuracy improvement, and control of the cable-driven and rigid parallel robots, striving to clearly illustrate the core technology of the FAST feed support system, as well as the theoretical methodology and engineering technology of cable-driven and rigid parallel mechanisms. The theoretical innovation and technological breakthroughs of the cable-driven and rigid parallel robots directly support the implementation of the feed support system, which is one of the three major innovations of the FAST. This book is geared toward the high-performance development trend of robotics and follows the complete development process of the design, control, and engineering practice of the FAST feed support system. It systematically elaborates the core theories and technologies, such as dynamic modeling, precision analysis, dimension synthesis, vibration suppression control, and inertia matching of cable-driven and rigid parallel robots. This book elaborates on theoretical research and engineering practice, which have significant inspiration and reference effects. It guides readers to gain engineering experience and practical knowledge. The intended readership includes researchers, postgraduate students, undergraduate students, technology enthusiasts, etc. .",

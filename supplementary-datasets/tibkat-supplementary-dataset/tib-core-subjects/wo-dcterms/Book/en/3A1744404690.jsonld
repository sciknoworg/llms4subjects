The main focus lies on the development of high-performance, energy-efficient embedded systems for the growing range of increasingly complex image processing applications. The holistic TULIPP approach is described in the book, which addresses hardware platforms, programming tools and embedded operating systems. Several of the results are available as open-source hardware/software for the community. The results are evaluated with several use cases taken from real-world applications in key domains such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), robotics, space and medicine. Discusses the development of high-performance, energy-efficient embedded systems for the growing range of increasingly complex image processing applications; Covers the hardware architecture of embedded image processing systems, novel methods, tools and libraries for programming those systems as well as embedded operating systems to manage those systems; Demonstrates results with several challenging applications, such as medical systems, robotics, drones and automotive.",

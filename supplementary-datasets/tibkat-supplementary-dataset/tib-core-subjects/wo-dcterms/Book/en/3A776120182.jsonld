                "This comprehensive book describes how proactive behavior, driven by a proactive personality, contributes to individual and organizational productivity. A consolidation of available research on the nature of proactivity in the workplace, this book explores methods of helping workers themselves become more effective, and managers understand effective ways of fostering this kind of thinking and behavior. Proactive behavior can achieve important outcomes, including improved job performance and satisfaction, career success and organizational prosperity. Andrew J. DuBrin outlines a number of useful strategies in areas such as opportunity creation, innovation, entrepreneurship and problem solving. Each chapter includes examples from firms and other organizations, as well as a self-quiz or checklist linked to the subject material. This book is an essential guide for academics in the fields of organizational behavior, industrial and organizational psychology, and human resource management. Presented in a user-friendly, accessible style, Proactive Personality and Behavior for Individual and Organizational Productivity will also be of interest to researchers, managers, and corporate professionals looking for ways to foster proactivity among workers, in order to enhance performance and productivity",

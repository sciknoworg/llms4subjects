            "abstract": "\u201cAttention\u201d is a primordial topic throughout Goffman\u2019s work. Already his dissertation thesis (1953) includes a separate chapter on \u201cthe organization of attention\u201d. In his later studies he developed various concepts related to attention, such as focused/unfocused interaction or \u201ccivil inattention\u201d. Although attention is evidently a crucial dimension of the interactional order, Goffman did not elaborate this topic systematically. The study of attention was later refined and enriched by conversation analysts who underlined the role of visual displays of attentiveness in social interaction. Against the backdrop of the notion of \u201cfocused interaction\u201d, this paper examines how the psychological approach to \u201cjoint attention\u201d differs from or amplifies Goffman\u2019s studies. Based on some of Cartier-Bresson\u2019s photos, it is shown that the contrasting set of focused/unfocused interaction needs to be supplemented by a third type of attention order, in which members are collectively oriented to an outward event. After a discussion of some of the practices of sustaining and re-establishing a focus of attention, empirical evidence is provided that certain interactional purposes can be achieved by displaying inattention. In the final discussion of Goffman\u2019s concept of \u201ccivil inattention\u201d, some historical and sociological dimensions are pointed out along which this concept can be further studied",

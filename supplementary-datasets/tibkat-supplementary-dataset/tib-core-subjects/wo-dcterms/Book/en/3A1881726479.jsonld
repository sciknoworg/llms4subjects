            "abstract": "The full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine has immense local impact and global consequences. Ukraine is experiencing huge human and economic suffering, which will have long-lasting effects. This war has been particularly devastating for the Ukrainian health sector, tremendously increasing the urgent need for specific services and simultaneously obstructing health outcomes and access to health care due to hostilities, disruption of service delivery, and damage and destruction of health facilities. Moreover, the recovery of Ukraine is shrouded in uncertainty as the duration of the ongoing war and the frequency and localization of the attacks are unknown, all occurring against the backdrop of economic challenges within the country and at a global scale. Despite an expected international effort to finance the recovery of Ukraine akin to the Marshall Plan, financial resources may not be easily available or may become more scarce and more expensive. Investments will receive more scrutiny, and competition for funds will increase due to monetary tightening, rising interest rates, and possibly sustained high inflation (International Monetary Fund 2022). However, in the short to medium term, Ukraine is expected to have favorable access to international financing on concessional terms. While Ukraine is struggling with the gruesome immediate impact of the war and a fight for survival, the shared understanding emerges that going back to business as usual will neither be possible nor desirable. This moment may also serve as a window of opportunity for rapid reform and innovation of health service delivery in Ukraine. Improving and reconstructing services while restoring and stabilizing them is critical to aiding a suffering population and to laying strong foundations of governance that will have lasting impacts into the country's future. This document provides a proposal for stakeholdersin the Ukrainian health sector on how service delivery may need to change, how to deal with this change, and how the health sector may come out stronger in the longer term. It focuses on the organization of health care service delivery and shares considerations of how it may develop using a long-term (10+ years) perspective",

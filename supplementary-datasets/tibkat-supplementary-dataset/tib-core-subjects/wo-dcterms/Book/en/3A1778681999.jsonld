            "title": "Hydrogeology : A Global Perspective",
            "abstract": "The field of groundwater hydrology and the discipline of hydrogeology have attracted a lot of attention during the past few decades. This is mainly because of the increasing need for high quality water, especially groundwater. This book, written by 15 scientists from 6 countries, clearly demonstrates the extensive range of issues that are dealt with in the field of hydrogeology. Karst hydrogeology and deposition processes, hydrogeochemistry, soil hydraulic properties as a factor affecting groundwater recharge processes, relevant conceptual models, and geophysical exploration for groundwater are all discussed in this book, giving the reader a global perspective on what hydrogeologists and co-scientists are currently working on to better manage groundwater resources. Graduate students, as well as practitioners, will find this book a useful resource and valuable guide",

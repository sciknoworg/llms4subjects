                "This book deals with electromagnetic theory and its applications at the level of a senior-level undergraduate course for science and engineering. The basic concepts and mathematical analysis are clearly developed and the important applications are analyzed. Each chapter contains numerous problems ranging in difficulty from simple applications to challenging. The answers for the problems are given at the end of the book. Some chapters which open doors to more advanced topics, such as wave theory, special relativity, emission of radiation by charges and antennas, are included. The material of this book allows flexibility in the choice of the topics covered. Knowledge of basic calculus (vectors, differential equations and integration) and general physics is assumed. The required mathematical techniques are gradually introduced. After a detailed revision of time-independent phenomena in electrostatics and magnetism in vacuum, the electric and magnetic properties of matter are discussed. Induction, Maxwell equations and electromagnetic waves, their reflection, refraction, interference and diffraction are also studied in some detail. Four additional topics are introduced: guided waves, relativistic electrodynamics, particles in an electromagnetic field and emission of radiation. A useful appendix on mathematics, units and physical constants is included.Contents1. Prologue. 2. Electrostatics in Vacuum. 3. Conductors and Currents. 4. Dielectrics. 5. Special Techniques and Approximation Methods. 6. Magnetic Field in Vacuum. 7. Magnetism in Matter. 8. Induction. 9. Maxwell\u2019s Equations. 10. Electromagnetic Waves. 11. Reflection, Interference, Diffraction and Diffusion. 12. Guided Waves. 13. Special Relativity and Electrodynamics. 14. Motion of Charged Particles in an Electromagnetic Field. 15. Emission of Radiation."

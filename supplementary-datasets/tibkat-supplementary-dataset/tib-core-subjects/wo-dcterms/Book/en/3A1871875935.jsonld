            "abstract": "\"Studying environmental changes to the seas and oceans through a variety of perspectives and disciplines, this pioneering book outlines the challenges of researching marine environmental issues. With no linear cause-and-effect relationship between marine environmental changes and the often human-induced stressors which produce them, the changes to our seas and oceans are complex and uncertain, arising from multiple and interconnected issues. Bringing together academic expertise from fields of study, this innovative book engages with stakeholders and branches of local ecological knowledge to address marine changes, outlining how they must be studied from multiple perspectives rather than a single academic discipline to reach effective solutions. Discussing marine interdisciplinarity in action, the book features international case studies from diverse fields across the ocean sciences, humanities and social sciences that explore art and science collaborations in practice. Showcasing the practical challenges and opportunities of such research, this will prove an invigorating read for students and scholars across such subject areas as environmental governance and regulation, marine and ocean sciences, sustainability studies and climate change. Its findings will also be of use to policymakers and practitioners concerned with marine changes across the world\"--",

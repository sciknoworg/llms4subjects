            "abstract": "\"The book's content is designed to provide practical guidance and insights for conducting experiments in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and publishing the results in scientific journals. It includes a detailed explanation of how to conduct HRI experiments and what to do and what not to do to get an article accepted for publication. It is tailored to those seeking to deepen their understanding of HRI methodologies, statistical measurements, and research design. The case studies and examples featured in the book focus on interactions between social robots and specific demographics such as children and older adults, making it relevant for individuals working in healthcare, education, and related domains. Also covered are common statistical measurements used in HRI research and quantitative, qualitative, and meta-analyses. The concepts are illustrated with several international case studies of interactions between social robots and children and older adults and robot learning instead of programming. The final chapter explores current trends in HRI and provides insights into what to look for in the coming years. It includes an extensive reference section to help HRI researchers in all these areas. This book will appeal to an international audience of advanced students, researchers, industry, and others who are actively engaged or interested in the field of HRI\"--",

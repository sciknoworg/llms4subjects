            "abstract": "\"Prefabricated housing is a practical solution since it is faster to build, less expensive than site-built houses, and potentially more energy efficient -- all aspects that are attractive to homeowners. According to manufacturers, they are seeing the trend for house size coming down but with higher quality amenities. Sheri Koones has authored a series of five prefabulous books; this one is her sixth. She includes a variety of prefab homes from small to large, including modular, SIPS (structural insulated panels), panelized, and kit built. The houses are from a range of locations across the United States and Canada. Koones includes luxurious, expensive houses as well as some modest, lower-cost homes. She includes two houses that replaced homes that burned down in the California fires. There are several ADUs (accessory dwelling units). The prefab manufacturers have changed in many cases since she wrote her last Prefabulous book in 2016. Although this book includes some of the best older companies, it also includes houses built by new, up-and-coming manufacturers.\" --",

                "An imperative, all-inclusive guide to designing, operating, and maintaining mission critical equipment and systemsThis proven guide offers a comprehensive study of the fundamentals of mission critical systems, which are designed to maintain ultra-high reliability, availability, and resiliency of electrical, mechanical, and digital systems and eliminate costly downtime. With an emphasis on clean energy and energy security, this Second Edition offers insight into the mission critical environment, featuring the industry improvements, standards, and techniques prevalent today. The author draws upon decades of experience in mission critical facilities engineering, offering recommendations for maintaining essential operations based on his firsthand knowledge of what does and does not work. Practical in focus, the text helps readers configure and customize their designs to correspond to their organizations' unique needs and risk tolerance. Most chapters in this text concentrate on an individual component of the mission critical system, including standby generators; automatic transfer switches; uninterruptible power supplies; fuel, fire, and battery systems; energy security; and data center cooling, along with other common challenges facing industry engineers. For each component, the author sets forth applications, available models, design choices, standard operating procedures, emergency action plans, maintenance procedures, and applicable codes and standards. This new edition emphasizes green technologies and certifications, illustrating alternative strategies for generating power in a cleaner, more efficient manner while maintaining business reliability and resiliency. New chapters on energy security and integrating clean energy into mission critical applications have been added. A description of the U.S. energy infrastructure's dependency on oil in relation to energy security in the mission critical industry is discussed. In addition, extensive photographs and diagrams illustrate how individual components and integrated systems work, and the author highlights measures that are mandated by policy and regulation.In today's global digital economy and 24/7 business operations, mission critical systems are at the forefront of concerns among both private and public operations. Architects, property managers, facility managers, building engineers, information technology professionals, data center personnel, and electrical and mechanical technicians will consult this t ..."

                "Dyadic (Walsh) analysis emerged as a new research area in applied mathematics and engineering in early seventies within attempts to provide answers to demands from practice related to application of spectral analysis of different classes of signals, including audio, video, sonar, and radar signals. In the meantime, it evolved in a mature mathematical discipline with fundamental results and important features providing basis for various applications. The book will provide fundamentals of the area through reprinting carefully selected earlier publications followed by overview of recent results concerning particular subjects in the area written by experts, most of them being founders of the field, and some of their followers. In this way, this first volume of the two volume book offers a rather complete coverage of the development of dyadic Walsh analysis, and provides a deep insight into its mathematical foundations necessary for consideration of generalizations and applications that are the subject of the second volume. The presented theory is quite sufficient to be a basis for further research in the subject area as well as to be applied in solving certain new problems or improving existing solutions for tasks in the areas which motivated development of the dyadic analysis."

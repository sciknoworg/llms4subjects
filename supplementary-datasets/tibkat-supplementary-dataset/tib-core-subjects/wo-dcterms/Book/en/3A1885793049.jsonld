            "abstract": "Muddy Thinking in the Mississippi River Delta uses the story of mud to answer a deceptively simple question: How can a place uniquely vulnerable to sea level rise be one of the nation\u2019s most promiscuous producers and consumers of fossil fuels? Organized around New Orleans and South Louisiana as a case study, this book examines how the unruly Mississippi River and its muddy delta shaped the people, culture, and governance of the region. It proposes a framework of \u201cmuddy thinking\u201d to gum the wheels of extractive capitalism and pollution that have brought us to the precipice of planetary collapse. Muddy Thinking calls upon our dirty, shared histories to address urgent questions of mutual survival and care in a rapidly changing world. \u201cNed Randolph urges us to pivot our attention to the profound complexity (and deep historicity) of mud. This is a brilliant book, ingeniously conceived, deftly argued, and beautifully written.\u201d \u2014 Patrick Anderson, author of Autobiography of a Disease \u201cMuddy Thinking in the Mississippi River Delta describes looping patterns of multivalent extractivism, while witnessing and calling forth righteous resistance, tender coexistence, and hope amid the messy petro-delta-apocalyptic.\u201d \u2014 Rebecca Snedeker, coauthor of Unfathomable City: A New Orleans Atlas \u201cRandolph\u2019s embrace of muddy alternatives to the capitalist and technopolitical vectors of the Anthropocene exemplifies beautifully how Energy Humanities can stay with the troubles of these times.\u201d \u2014 Dominic Boyer, author of No More Fossils \u201cMud is Randolph\u2019s point of departure for understanding the region\u2019s past and future\u2014a vehicle of disruption and constraint, certainly, but also, in Randolph\u2019s deft reading, the very condition of possibility for sustaining life amid ecological ruin.\u201d \u2014 Valerie Hartouni, Professor Emerita, UC San Diego",

            "abstract": "\"Among international financial centres (IFCs), London is known as the 'Western hub of Islamic Finance', on account of its well-developed legal infrastructure. However, Brexit has threatened London's status and consequently, the financial services industry is moving to Dublin to continue operating in the Euro region. Similarly, Islamic finance (IF) service providers in the UK are also looking to Dublin for expansion of this niche area in euro member states. This is the first book to be written about Islamic finance operations in the Eurozone. The book offers an in-depth description of International Financial Centres and the growth of Islamic Finance, compares the growth of Islamic finance in London, Dubai and Kuala Lumpur, outlines the implications of Brexit for financial service providers in London in general and Islamic investors in particular and also presents a case study of Ireland to establish the latter as the most appropriate country to promote IF in the Eurozone. The time is particularly right for a book exploring the potential of Ireland to emerge as a Eurozone hub of Islamic finance, as a result of Britain's exit from Europe. The book will cater to the needs of readers studying Islamic finance (IF) in the disciplines of economics, business, law, and religion. A secondary market includes practitioners, such as policymakers, lawyers, fund managers, accountants, regulators and international investors, who will be interested in exploring the benefits that the UK and Ireland have to offer the Islamic finance industry\"--",

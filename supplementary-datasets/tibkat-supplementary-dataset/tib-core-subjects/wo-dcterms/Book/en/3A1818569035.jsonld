                "This book serves as a practical resource for start-ups looking for innovating their business models in domestic and global markets. It describes the innovative business practices adopted by start-ups during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a special emphasis on value proposition innovation and business model innovation more generally. The BMI-Pandemic 2.15 model, which is an expanded version of the Odyssey 3.14 model, is presented to highlight 15 guidelines for innovating business models during pandemics. In order to promote open innovation, this book emphasizes the value of strategic alliances with academic libraries, peer start-ups, and freelancers. Additionally, using actual start-up case studies, it demonstrates how important technological innovation is for gathering feedback, prototyping, and conducting both secondary as well as primary market research. The need of regularly experimenting with new approaches, learning from mistakes, and enhancing current processes are also emphasized in this book. Theoretical insights are linked with practical experiences of start-ups amid the pandemic. With a perfect balance of empirical research and assessment study types, this book is a source of quick knowledge for entrepreneurs, academics and researchers on how to enhance a company\u2019s innovative capacities and success rates."

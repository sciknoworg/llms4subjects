            "abstract": "Scholars have offered insight into the Davidic Covenant and the future hope for Israel. However, their works up to this point have overlooked a detailed influence of 2 Samuel 7 on Ezekiel 34 and 37. Therefore, reading the text of Ezekiel in relation to the original form of the Davidic Covenant may reveal further indications of the literary, theological and conceptual influence of 2 Samuel 7 and the help it provides in understanding the function of the promised ruler in Ezekiel 34 and 37. To establish this influence, an intertextual approach proves to be relevant. The intertextual approach used for the exegesis in this book establishes how biblical books are connected and proves the influence of the text of 2 Samuel on that of Ezekiel 34 and 37. The study of 2 Samuel 7 in relation to the Davidic Covenant underscores God\u2019s faithfulness and concern for his people. Godly leadership is the kind of leadership that God desires for his people. Looking at the Davidic Covenant closely and God\u2019s promises in the text of Ezekiel encompasses important implications for African leadership",

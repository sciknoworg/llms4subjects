            "abstract": "This twenty-third volume in Erasmus' Opera omnia (ASD) is the third volume ofthe ninth 'ordo', that is the 'ordo' of the Apologies. The division into 'ordines' each'ordo' being devoted to a specific literary or thematic category - was laiddown by Erasmus himself for the posthumous publication of his works (c\u00a3 Generalintroduction, ASD I, pp. x, xvii-xviii, and C. Reedijk, Tandem bona causa triumphat.Zur Geschichte des Gesamtwerkes des Erasmus von Rotterdam. Vortrage derAeneas-Silvius-3tiftung an der Universitat Basel, XVI, Basel/Stuttgart, 1980,pp. 12 sqq., 21-22. For the reason why the collected Apologies eventuallybecame the ninth 'ordo,' see the Preface to ASD IX,2, p. vii).The present volume contains the Apologia ad Iacobum Fabrum Stapulensem,edited by Andrea W Steenbeek (Leiden). It is the slightly adapted version of herLeiden Ph.D. thesis (1994) which was supervised by Professor H.]. de longe.The Conseil international pour l'edition \u00b7des reuvres completes d'Erasmemourns the loss of the former director of North-Holland Publishing Company,Mr. M.D. Frank, who died on 9 november 1995.

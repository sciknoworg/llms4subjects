            "abstract": "This book analyzes the theoretical and political positions of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) against imperialism in the context of the Second Boer War, taking into consideration the following components: colonialism, in the sense of the SDF's assessment of the European colonial expansion and the reality of colonial peoples, in this case the situation of the Boer people and the native populations of South Africa; colonial politics, understood as the discussions of the government of the colonies, whether the possibility of establishing some type of imperial federation or the need to abandon them; imperialism itself, which included debates on the economic causes of the expansion of powers and its character as a generalized policy of bourgeois states or phase of capitalism; the imperialist war and national defense in the sense of the possibility of a war between the European powers and the need to defend Great Britain and its possessions and, the second Boer war itself, which implies taking into account the causes attributed to the conflict, the positions of the different party members (supporting or condemning the conflict) and the means to stop it",

                "\"This book offers an analytical overview of established electric generation processes, along with the present status & improvements for meeting the strains of reconstruction. These old methods are hydro-electric, thermal & nuclear power production. The book covers climatic constraints; their affects and how they are shaping thermal production. The book also covers the main renewable energy sources, wind and PV cells and the hybrids arising out of these. It covers distributed generation which already has a large presence is now being joined by wind & PV energies. It covers their accommodation in the present system. It introduces energy stores for electricity; when they burst upon the scene in full strength are expected to revolutionize electricity production. In all the subjects covered, there are references to power marketing & how it is shaping production. There will also be a reference chapter on how the power market works\"--Provided by publisher",
                "Significant breakthroughs in the research and development of electricity power generation have been non-existent over the last few decades. Weaving new technologies into existing monolithic processes remains the accepted pathway for implementing change, and can be more aptly classified as maintenance rather than restructuring. In an effort to revitalize a technologically dormant electrical industry in need of fresh approaches, Electricity Power Generation integrates historical analysis, insight into emerging power sources, and forward-thinking perspective to help spur innovative new ways for harnessing energy.Electricity Power Generation looks at conventional power sources such as hydroelectric, thermal, and nuclear power production, along with current renewable alternatives, such as wind and solar energy, to provide an overall view of where power generation has taken us and where it can eventually lead us. This book:. Offers basic insight into the power sector and offers the latest technology. Can be used as a comprehensive reference tool and a teaching aid. Is highly illustrated and written in language that is simple and easy to read . Contains chapters on the compelling developments in tidal and wave energy. Covers power marketing and how it is shaping the methods for generating powerAs power generation operates within the context of environmental issues, exploration of new energy solutions becomes paramount. Electricity Power Generation focuses on this concern and calls for the development of a new paradigm-one that champions sustainability by advancing powerful alternatives for cleaner and more efficient ways of generating power. Digamber M. Tagare is founder and Managing Director of Madhav Capacitors Pvt. Ltd. He is responsible for bringing capacitor manufacturing technology to India, and was awarded with the title of \"Father of Capacitor Industries in India\" from Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers Association (IEEMA) in 2002. Mr. Tagare has published more than 100 technical papers and four books on capacitors and reactive power management. He is a member of both the National Association of Corrosion Engineers and the Electrical Research Association, as well as a Senior Life Member of the IEEE"

                "Hungary was once a frontrunner of democratization. However, since Viktor Orb\u00e1n came to power in 2010, the country has been the subject of critical media coverage and concerns due to illiberal policies and anti-EU rhetoric. The book helps to analyze and evaluate the developments by providing relevant case knowledge. It provides sound insights into Hungary\u2019s system of government, society, parties and media, as well as selected policy areas. It focuses on how different policy areas have been influenced by the EU, traces important lines of development over the past decades, and compares the findings with other states of the region. The authors\u2019 professional expertise and broad knowledge of the political systems of Hungary and Europe provide a well-founded analysis of the developments in the region. The editors Dr. Ellen Bos is Professor of Comparative Politics with a focus on Central and Eastern Europe in the EU and Vice-Rector for Research and Young Researchers at Andr\u00e1ssy University Budapest. Dr. Astrid Lorenz is Professor of the Political System of Germany and Politics in Europe and Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Philosophy at Leipzig University.",

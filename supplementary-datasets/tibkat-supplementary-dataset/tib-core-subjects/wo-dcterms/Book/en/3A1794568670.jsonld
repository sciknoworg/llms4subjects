            "abstract": "Energy management systems (EMSs) are nowadays considered one of the most relevant technical solutions for enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and economy of smart micro/nanogrids, both in terrestrial and vehicular applications. For this reason, the recent technical literature includes numerous technical contributions on EMSs for residential/commercial/vehicular micro/nanogrids that encompass renewable generators and battery storage systems (BSS) The volume \u201cEnergy Management Systems for Optimal Operation of Electrical Micro/Nanogrids\u201d, was released as a Special Issue of the journal Energies, published by MDPI, with the aim of expanding the knowledge on EMSs for the optimal operation of electrical micro/nanogrids by presenting topical and high-quality research papers that address open issues in the identified technical field. The volume is a collection of seven research papers authored by research teams from several countries, where different hot topics are accurately explored. The reader will have the possibility to benefit from original scientific results concerning, in particular, the following key topics: distribution systems; smart home/building; battery energy storage; demand uncertainty; energy forecasting; model predictive control; real-time control, microgrid planning; and electrical vehicles",

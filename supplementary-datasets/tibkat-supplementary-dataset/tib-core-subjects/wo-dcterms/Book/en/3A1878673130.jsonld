                "This book focuses on the basic common technologies of smart manufacturing system and smart workshop. The applications of artificial intelligence in manufacturing system have been addressed from different perspectives, for example, smart optimization of cutting parameters, smart process planning, smart workshop and scheduling, and smart integration of process planning and scheduling. In the process of writing, this book highlights the combination of basic theory and engineering practice. In the basic theory part, the book clearly explains the basic issues of smart manufacturing system, including the core support technology of smart manufacturing, the basic theories and models of cutting parameter optimization, process optimization and scheduling, and the basic concepts and intelligence of smart manufacturing workshop model, optimization methods, etc. In the engineering practice part, this book enumerates a large number of research cases, trying to clearly demonstrate the basic problems of manufacturing system intelligence, and each chapter is accompanied by typical cases to help readers better understand and master the basic theories involved in stamping."

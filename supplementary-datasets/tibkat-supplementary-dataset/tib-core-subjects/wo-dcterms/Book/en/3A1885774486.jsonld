            "abstract": "Why are some figures hidden from history? Eliza Orme, despite becoming the first woman in Britain to earn a university degree in Law in 1888, leading both a political organization and a labour investigation in 1892, and participating actively in the women\u2019s suffrage movement into the early twentieth century, is one such figure.   Framed as a \u2018research memoir\u2019, Eliza Orme\u2019s Ambitions fills out earlier scant accounts of this intriguing life, while speculating about why it has been overlooked. Established historian Leslie Howsam shapes the story around her own persistent curiosity in the context of a transformed research landscape, where important letters and explosive newspaper accounts have only recently come to light. These materials show how Orme\u2019s career ambitions brought her into conflict with the male-dominated legal community of her time, while her political ambitions were cut short by disputes with other women activists whose notions of political strategy she repudiated. In public, Orme was a formidable debater for the causes she supported and against opponents whose strategies\u2014even for women\u2019s suffrage\u2014she repudiated. In private, she was generous, warm, and witty, close to friends, family, and her female partner. Howsam\u2019s account of uncovering Orme\u2019s professional and personal trajectory will appeal to academic and non-academic readers interested in the progress and setbacks women experienced in the late-Victorian and Edwardian decades",

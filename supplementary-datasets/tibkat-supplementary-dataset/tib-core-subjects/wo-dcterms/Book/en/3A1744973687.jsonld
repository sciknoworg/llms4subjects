                "Almost every person works at some point in their lives. The Research Handbook on Work and Well-Being examines the association of particular work experiences with employee and organizational health and performance. Ronald J. Burke and Kathryn M. Page bring together an impressive collection of contributions where well-being is considered an umbrella term for happiness, satisfaction, flow, engagement, commitment and organizational identification, among other concepts. Chapters describe successful organizational efforts to achieve high levels of employee well-being and creating psychologically healthy workplaces. They cover topics such as transformational leadership, organizational support, training and development and supportive work-family policies and programs. Acknowledging that work experiences and conditions can also contribute to dissatisfaction, insecurity, illness, injuries and even death, they also examine negative work experiences and conditions such as abusive supervision, occupational stress, little control and insecurity. Practical and engaging, this Handbook will appeal to academics and students interested in work and health. Containing the latest research evidence, it will also offer valuable insights to human resource managers, organizational wellness managers and occupational health practitioners",

                "I applaud The Fukushima Catastrophe \u2013 To What End? and its authors Lau Kin Chi, Huang Xiaomei and He Zhixiong, because it analyzes how human and environmental risks are exacerbated by political and industrial policies that put profits above the protection of the people. -- Rebecca Johnson, co-founder, International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), Laureate of Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 This book serves as a timely, critical reminder of the dangers of ignoring or obfuscating the multi-layered terrain of nuclear power, including its largely unaccounted for social and ecological costs, and the world\u2019s inability to deal with nuclear waste disposal. -- Anita Rampal, Professor and Dean (retired), Faculty of Education, University of Delhi, India Based on a variety of interviews with residents, farmers, scientists, journalists and activists who have been affected by the Fukushima catastrophe, the authors underscore the personal, political and humanitarian impacts in testimonies, science and photos. The book engagingly addresses diverse issues that continue to haunt and persist, and calls for collective responsibility to deal with the devastating environmental, economic and social consequences of nuclear energy. The book offers a critique of the violent history of modernism and supremacy of science that have been articulated into all forms of social injustice and ecological injustice. Lau Kin Chi is Coordinator, Programme on Cultures of Sustainability at the Centre for Cultural Research and Development, Lingnan University, Hong Kong, China. Huang Xiaomei is a freelance translator based in Hong Kong, China. He Zhixiong is Director of the Digital Section, Green Ground Rural Reconstruction Social Enterprise Alliance, China.",

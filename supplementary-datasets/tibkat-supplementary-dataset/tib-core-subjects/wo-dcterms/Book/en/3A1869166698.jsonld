            "abstract": "This book considers the evolution and characteristics of Nigeria\u2019s third-generation literature, which emerged between the late 1980s and the early 1990s and is marked by expressive modes and concerns distinctly different from those of the preceding era.  The creative writing of this period reflects new sensibilities and anxieties about Nigeria\u2019s changing fortunes in the post-colonial era. The literature of the third generation is startling in its candidness, irreverence as well as the brutal self-disclosure of its characters, and it is governed by an unusually wide-ranging sweep in narrative techniques. This book examines six key texts of the oeuvre: Maria Ajima\u2019s The Web, Okey Ndibe\u2019s Foreign Gods, Inc., Teju Cole\u2019s Open City, Chika Unigwe\u2019s On Black Sisters Street, Lola Shoneyin\u2019s The Secret Lives of Baba Segi\u2019s Wives, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s The Thing Around Your Neck. The texts interpret contemporary corruption and other unspeakable social malaise; together, they point to the exciting future of Nigerian literature, which has always been defined by its daring creativity and inventive expressive modes. Even conventional storytelling strategies receive revitalizing energies in these angst-driven narratives.  This book will be of interest to students and researchers of contemporary African literature, Sociology, Gender and women\u2019s studies, and post-colonial cultural expression more broadly",

            "abstract": "Build professional, cloud-ready web applications from frontend to backend using the latest features of Django and React Key Features Explore the advanced features of - popular frameworks like Django and React by working on hands-on projects Launch your career as a full-stack Python web developer with this step-by-step guide Learn to deploy complete web applications to AWS Book Description Django developers often need to rely on frontend developers to build a client-side solution for their web apps. By combining the capabilities of React with Django, this book creates a complete learning path to go from being a backend developer to a full stack developer in no time. This book will help you use React to build state-of-the-art UI layouts and Django to create an immaculate backend. This web development book will help you discover the full potential of combining the dual power of the two most popular frameworks - React and Django. You'll build full stack applications, including a RESTful API in the backend and an intuitive frontend, while exploring the advanced features of both frameworks. You'll also explore how the dynamic functionality of the React framework can be used to build your frontend systems and how the ORM layer of Django helps in simplifying database interactions. This will in turn boost the development process for building the backend and facilitate the building of full stack applications. By the end of the book, you will be able to create a dynamic full stack app starting from scratch on your own. What you will learn Explore how things work differently under the hood in the frontend as well as the backend Discover how to build an API with Django Start from scratch to build an intuitive UI using React's capabilities Dockerize and prepare projects for deployment Deploy an API and UI using AWS services such as AWS EC2, S3, and AWS Cloudfront Who this book is for This book is for Django web developers who want to get started with full-stack development and learn a frontend framework that can be quickly bootstrapped with the backend to build full-stack applications. Familiarity to React and JavaScript would be an added advantage",

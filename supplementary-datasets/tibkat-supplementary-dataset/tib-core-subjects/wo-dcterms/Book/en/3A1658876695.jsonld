This book provides the guidelines and tutorial projects to show you how to translate your existing iOS app to the Android platform. You\u2019ll use your mobile app knowledge to structure your Android apps in a similar way to how you would structure your iOS apps. To implement use cases with detailed screens, the most common mobile topics are discussed, including user interfaces, managing data, and networking with remote services. As you move through the book, you\u2019ll create Android apps with rich UI components to handle common CRUD operations locally and remotely. There are many Android goodies described in the book. Instead of relying on routine text descriptions, you\u2019ll discover the uniqueness of Android and appreciate the many features that are unique to the platform. This book also explores more powerful mobile UX patterns that are commonly used on the iOS and Android platforms. When you finish reading Migrating to Android for iOS Developers, you\u2019ll be an Android developer as well as an iOS developer. And, you will be fully convinced you can do everything in Android that you can do in iOS"

The reading of the book is fluid, pleasant and carries the academic rigour necessary to be a widely read and used work in the academy.\" -- Paulo Ueti, Journal of Theology for Southern Africa \"Castillo\u2019s book is an important scholarly work that offers an attractive vision of a political ecology rooted in and fertilized by the creative wisdom of God.\" --Hilda P. Koster, Modern Theology, University of St. Michael\u2019s College, University of Toronto What is the relationship between salvation, human liberation, and care for creation? To answer this question Daniel Castillo expands on the ideas presented in Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s classic work A Theology of Liberation and proposes a novel concept: green liberation theology. In this compelling and original work Castillo places Guti\u00e9rrez in dialogue with a diverse array of theological, ecological, and socio-scientific discourses, drawing upon the work of Jon Sobrino, Willie James Jennings, Walter Brueggemann, Ellen Davis, and others, paying special attention to Pope Francis\u2019 encyclical Laudato Si\u2019",

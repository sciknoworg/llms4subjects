            "abstract": "Road transportation is a basic need for mobility and daily life. Currently, there are a number of challenges in dealing with distressed pavement and seeking new materials with sustainability in mind in pavement systems. Therefore, it is important to conduct further research in the following areas: (1) pavement structure, materials, and design; (2) pavement models as better solutions for pavement constructions; (3) pavement mechanics for improved understanding and mechanism analyses; (4) utilization of recycled materials for environmentally friendly solutions; (5) maintenance and rehabilitation for an extended life span of pavement; (6) intelligent construction for project management, energy conservation, and future constructions; and (7) innovative approaches to test and evaluate the performance of pavement materials. The purpose of this Special Issue \"Achievements and Prospects of Advanced Pavement Materials Technologies\" is to explore new research ideas for pavement materials as described above",

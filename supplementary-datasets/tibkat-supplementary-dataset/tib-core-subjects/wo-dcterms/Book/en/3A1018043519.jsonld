            "abstract": "Adaptive control is the control method used by a controller which must adapt to a controlled system with parameters which vary, or are initially uncertain. An adaptive control system utilizes on-line identification of which either system parameter or controller parameter, which does not need a priori information about the bounds on these uncertain or time-varying parameters. These approaches consider their control design in the sense of Lyapunov. Besides, there are still some branches by combining adaptive control and other control methods, i.e., nonlinear control methods, intelligent control methods, and predict control methods, to name but a few. Addresses some original contributions reporting the latest advances in adaptive control. It aims to gather the latest research on state-of-the-art methods, applications and research for the adaptive control theory, and recent new findings obtained by the technique of adaptive control. Apparently, the book cannot include all research topics. Different aspects of adaptive control are explored. Chapters includes some new tendencies and developments in research on a adaptive formation controller for multi-robot systems; L1 adaptive control design of the the longitudinal dynamics of a hypersonic vehicle model; adaptive high-gain control of biologically inspired receptor systems; adaptive residual vibration suppression of sigid-flexible coupled systems; neuro-hierarchical sliding mode control for under-actuated mechanical systems; neural network adaptive PID control design based on PLC for a water-level system; and fuzzy-based design of networked control systems with random time delays and packet dropout in the forward communication channel--",

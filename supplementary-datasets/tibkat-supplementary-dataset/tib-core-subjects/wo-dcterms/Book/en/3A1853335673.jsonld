            "title": "Owning Books and Preserving Documents in Medieval Jerusalem : The Library of Burhan al-Din",
            "abstract": "In the late medieval period manuscripts galore circulated in private collections and in educational libraries in the cities of the Middle East. Yet very few have left a documentary trail or have survived as an easily identifiable compact corpus. Writing their histories, understanding their social settings and comprehending their intellectual profiles is therefore a challenge.This book discusses the only known private book collection from pre-Ottoman Jerusalem for which we have a trail of documents. It belonged to an otherwise unknown resident, Burh\u0101n al-D\u012bn; after his death, his books were sold in a public auction and the list of objects sold has survived.This list \u2013 edited and translated in this volume \u2013 shows that a humble part-time reciter of the late 14th century had almost 300 books in his house, evidence that book ownership extended beyond the elite. Based on a corpus of almost fifty documents from the \u1e24aram al-shar\u012bf collection in Jerusalem, it is also possible to get a rare insight into the social world of such an individual. Finally, the book gives a unique insight into book prices as it will make available the largest such set of data for the pre-Ottoman period",

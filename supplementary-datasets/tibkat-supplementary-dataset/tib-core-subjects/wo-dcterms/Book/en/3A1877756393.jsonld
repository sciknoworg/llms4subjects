            "abstract": "The fruit and nut crops are laden with health benefits. As people are becoming more conscious about their health and nutritional uptake, the worldwide demand and consumption of fruit and nut crops are steadily increasing. This has made it hard to keep pace between the rate of fruit and nut production and its consumption. To meet this increasing demand, there is a need to produce improved, better yielding, and high-quality fruit and nut crops. This book intends to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of fruit and nut crops. Such information covered in this book will directly enhance both basic and applied research in fruit and nut crops and will particularly be useful for students, scientists, researchers, teachers, breeders, policy-makers, and growers",

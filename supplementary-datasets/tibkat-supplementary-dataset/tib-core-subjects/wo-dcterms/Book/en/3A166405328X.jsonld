As well as slipping phenomena, other important and relevant friction related concepts and applications are presented to clearly guide you through this complex topic. This book explains the use of equipment such as tribometers in measuring friction in falls and their level of accuracy. It explains other measuring techniques used and assumptions that come up when working with friction in fall cases, and shows which ones are erroneous and which are valid. It also discusses other aspects that apply to the physics of friction in slip and fall accidents, and gives you a back-to-basics understanding of the physics of falls. It is a great companion volume to Slips, Trips, Missteps and Their Consequences. It is an essential book and a call to action for any professional currently involved in the investigation, research and litigation of slip and fall incidents.\"--",

            "abstract": "Cryptography An introduction to one of the backbones of the digital world Cryptography is one of the most important aspects of information technology security, central to the protection of digital assets and the mitigation of risks that come with increased global connectivity. The digital world is wholly reliant on secure algorithms and protocols for establishing identity, protecting user data, and more. Groundbreaking recent developments in network communication and a changing digital landscape have been accompanied by similar advances in cryptography, which is more central to digital life than ever before. This book constitutes a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to the algorithms, protocols, and standards which protect the modern internet. Built around both foundational theories and hundreds of specific algorithms, it also incorporates the required skills in complex mathematics. The result is an indispensable introduction to the protocols and systems which should define cryptography for decades to come. Readers will also find: Over 450 problems with accompanying solutions to reinforce key concepts and test retention Detailed discussion of topics including symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, random number generation, user authentication, and many more Over 200 figures and tables that provide rich detail to the content Cryptography: Algorithms, Protocols, and Standards for Computer Security is ideal for undergraduate and graduate students in cryptography and information technology subjects, as well as for researchers looking for a working reference on existing cryptographic algorithms and protocols.",

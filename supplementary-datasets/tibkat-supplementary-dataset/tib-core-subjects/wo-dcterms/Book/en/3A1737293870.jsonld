            "abstract": "\"Engineering systems and products are an important element of world economy and each year billions of dollars are spent to develop, manufacture, operate, and maintain systems and products around the globe. Because of this, global competition is forcing reliability and other professionals to work closely during the product design and manufacturing phase. This book is an attempt to meet the need for a single volume that considers a wide range of applied reliability topics. The material covered will be treated in such a manner that the reader will require no previous knowledge to understand it. The sources of most of the material presented will be given in the reference section at the end of each chapter. At appropriate places, the book will contain examples along with their solutions and at the end of each chapter there will be numerous problems to test reader comprehension. This will allow the volume to be used as a textbook as well as a reference. This book will be useful to many people including design professionals, system engineers, reliability specialists, graduate and senior undergraduate students, researchers and instructors of reliability engineering, and engineers-at-large\"--",

                "This international conference was organized by the sponsoring agencies with the following objectives in mind: to bring together active researchers involved in energy compression, switching, and storage who have a major interest in plasma physics, electron beams, electric and magnetic energy storage systems, and high voltage and high current switches. Areas of interest include: Slow systems: 50-60 Hz machinery, transformers, flywheel-homopolar generators, slow capacitors, inductors, and solid state switches. Inter\u00ad mediate systems: fast capacitor banks, superconducting storage and switch\u00ad ing, gas, vacuum, and dielectric switching, nonlinear (magnetic) switching, 5 6 fast (10 - 10 Hz) capacitors and fuses. Fast systems: Marx, Blumlein, oil, water, and pressurized water dielectrics, switches, magnetic insula\u00ad tion, electron beams, and plasmas. The Editors extend thanks to all the authors, and attendees (and their supporting institutions, and companies), everyone of whom in his own measure helped to make the conference a success. The Editors further wish to thank the members of the Scientific Committee for the help they have given in organizing the conference and in editing, especially J. C. Martin and H. L. Laquer. Special recognition is due the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory whose Electrical Engineering Department provided the Secretary of the Scientific Committee and one of the Editors, and the yeowoman services of Sharon Dodson and Cheri Johnson in all the mailings, correspondence, and receiving and organizing of the manuscripts. The LLL Technical Information Department provided the design and printing of the conference announcements and the instructional formats for the authors' manuscripts.",

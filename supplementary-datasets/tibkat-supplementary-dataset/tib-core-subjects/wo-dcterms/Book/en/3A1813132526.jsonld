            "abstract": "\"Proteomics aims to study all the proteins of human and other living systems, and their properties to provide an integrated view of cellular processes. The proteomic study involves the application of high-throughput technologies that are rapidly evolving and new platforms are coming forward regularly with versatile novel applications and are valuable tools for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. This book provides a detailed understanding of the basics of proteins and proteomics, Gel based-proteomics techniques, basics of mass-spectrometry and quantitative proteomics, Interactomics: basics and applications, and advancement in proteomics. It also covers basic knowledge about sample preparation, mass spectrometry workflow, different chromatography technologies and quantitative proteomics. It also highlights the application and challenges of various high throughput integrated proteomics technologies capable of fast and accurate screening of thousands of biomolecules are found to be very effective for studying disease pathobiology and identification of next-generation biomarkers and potential drug/ vaccine targets, and therefore considered as valuable tools for multidisciplinary research. Features: Basics of proteins and proteomics techniques In-depth understanding of mass-spectrometry and quantitative proteomics An overview of interactomics and its application for translational research. Advancement in the field of proteomics and challenges in clinical applications. We hope the knowledge gained from the reading of the text will intrigue and motivate the young minds to explore future opportunities in the constantly evolving field of proteomics\"--",

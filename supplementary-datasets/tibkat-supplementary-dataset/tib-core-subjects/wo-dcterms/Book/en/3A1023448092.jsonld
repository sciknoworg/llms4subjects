                "'Wow, this book includes all of the best and most path-breaking original research on trade and the environment, all in one place. These authors have tackled some of the most difficult and vexing problems in economic policy analysis: does trade worsen the environment, by allowing wider exploitation? Or, can trade improve the environment, by allowing clean technology transfer? Is the abatement achieved by unilateral pollution control offset by increased pollution elsewhere? The conditions for each such outcome are carefully analyzed by the different papers in this book, as carefully selected by an editor who knows this field and has made major contributions to it.'--Don Fullerton, University of Illinois, US. This volume brings together a selection of recent articles by leading scholars on the economics of international trade and the environment. The collection incorporates key papers published between 2000 and 2013 that investigate the major themes in the field including the effects of globalization on environmental outcomes, the effects of environmental policy on international competitiveness, evidence on the pollution haven hypothesis, effects of trade on the sustainability of renewable resources, interaction between trade policy and environmental policy and trade and climate change. This insightful collection is an essential reference for students, researchers and policymakers",

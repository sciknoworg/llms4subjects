            "abstract": "Memory in Place brings together Indigenous and non-Indigenous                    scholars and practitioners grappling with the continued potency of memories and                    experiences of colonialism. While many of these conversations have taken place                    on a national stage, this collection returns to the rich intimacy of the local.                    From Queensland's sweeping Gulf Country, along the shelly beaches of south                    Sydney, Melbourne\u2019s city gardens and the rugged hills of South Australia,                    through Central Australia\u2019s dusty heart and up to the majestic Kimberley, the                    collection charts how interactions between Indigenous people, settlers and their                    descendants are both remembered and forgotten in social, political, and cultural                    spaces. It offers uniquely diverse perspectives from a range of disciplines                    including history, anthropology, memory studies, archaeology, and linguistics                    from both established and emerging scholars; from Indigenous and non-Indigenous                    contributors; and from academics as well as museum and cultural heritage                    practitioners. The collection locates some of the nation\u2019s most pressing                    political issues with attention to the local, and the ethics of commemoration                    and relationships needed at this scale. It will be of interest to those who see                    the past as intimately connected to the future",

            "abstract": "From the dawn of civilization, humans have been dreaming of happy, healthy and long-life. Our life expectancy is twice longer than 100 years ago. We know more about the diseases. Therefore we have developed new drugs to fight against them. The demand for drugs was so high that we developed Pharma industries. Although Pharma industries took responsibility of producing the needed drugs and gave us a quality of life, misuse of drugs brought further complication. Therefore, discovery, production, distribution, and the phase of administration of patients' quality assurance has to be controlled with a technological procedure and tight regulations to make the system as effective as possible for the benefit of human health. Our book provides selected but vital information on the sources, tools, technologies and regulations regarding the current status of medicine development",

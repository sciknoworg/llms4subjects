            "abstract": "The development of Industry 4.0 technologies is based on the rapid growth of the computing capabilities of mobile wireless technologies, which has made it possible to significantly expand the range of digital services and form a conglomeration of socio-cyber-physical systems and smart technologies. The First Section discusses the issues of building security systems based on the proposed Concept of multi-contour security systems, taking into account the hybridity and synergy of modern targeted cyber-attacks, their integration with social engineering methods. This approach not only increases the level of security, but also forms an objective approach to the use of post-quantum security mechanisms based on the proposed Lotka-Volterra models.  The Second Section analyzes the features of the functioning of social Internet services and establishes their role in ensuring the information security of the state. An approach is proposed to identify signs of threats in the text content of social Internet services, which will allow to quickly respond to changing situations and effectively counteract such threats. A classifier of information security profiles of users of social Internet services has been developed to assess the level of their danger as potential participants in disinformation campaigns. A method for identifying and evaluating the information and psychological impact on user communities in services is proposed. Models of conflict interaction of user groups in social Internet services are considered on the example of civil movements. To effectively counter threats to information security of the state, it is proposed to use the concept of synergistic user interaction and self-organization processes in a virtual community. Particular attention is paid to countering the manipulation of public opinion in the decision-making process by users of social Internet services.  The Third Section proposes a biometric security system that works to authenticate users based on a comparison of their fingerprints and certain templates stored in a biometric database. A method for determining the contour based on the passage of a curve and the filtering function of contour lines has been developed. The stage of skeletal identification is analyzed in detail. The Ateb-Gabor method with wave thinning has been developed. The performance of skeletal algorithms such as the Zhang-Suen thinning algorithm, the Hilditch algorithm, and the Ateb-Gabor method with wave decimation is analyzed. The presented results of experiments with biometric fingerprints based on the NIST Special Database 302 database showed the effectiveness of the proposed method. The software and firmware were developed using the Arduino Nano",

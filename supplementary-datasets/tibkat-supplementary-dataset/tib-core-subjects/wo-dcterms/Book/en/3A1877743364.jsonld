            "abstract": "This book contains well-written monographs within the broad spectrum of applied mathematics, offering an interesting reading of some of the current trends and problems in this fascinating and critically important field of science to a broad category of researchers and practitioners. Recent developments in high-performance computing are radically changing the way we do numerics. As the size of problems is expected to grow very large in the future, the gap between fast and slow algorithms is growing rapidly. Novel classes of numerical methods with reduced computational complexity are therefore needed to make the rigorous numerical solution of difficult problems arising in an industrial setting more affordable. The book is structured in four distinct parts, according to the purpose and approaches used in the development of the contributions, ranging from optimization techniques to graph-oriented approaches and approximation theory, providing a good mix of both theory and practice",

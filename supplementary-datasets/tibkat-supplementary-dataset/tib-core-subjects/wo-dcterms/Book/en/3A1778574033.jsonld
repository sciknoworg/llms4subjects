            "abstract": "The purpose of optimization is to maximize the quality of lives, productivity in time, as well as interests. Therefore, optimization is an ongoing challenge for selecting the best possible among many other inferior designs. For a hundred years in the past, as optimization has been essential to human life, several techniques have been developed and utilized. Such a development has been one of the long-lasting challenges in engineering and science, and it is now clear that the optimization goals in many of real-life problems are unlikely to be achieved without resource for computational techniques. The history of such a development in the optimization techniques starts from the early 1950s and is still in progress. Since then, the efforts behind this development dedicated by many distinguished scientists, mathematicians, and engineers have brought us today a level of quality of lives. This book concerns with the computational optimization in engineering and techniques to resolve the underlying problems in real life. The current book contains studies from scientists and researchers around the world from North America to Europe and from Asia to Australia",

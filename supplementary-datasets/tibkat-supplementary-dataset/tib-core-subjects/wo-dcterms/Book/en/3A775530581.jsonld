            "abstract": "The primary purpose of this proceedings is to look at a common body of water shared by Canada and the US and to summarize knowledge about the dynamics of this system with a primary focus of land use, water management, and bridging the gap between researchers and the public. From the preface: Lake Champlain spans two states, Vermont and New York, as well as two nations, the United States of America and Canada. Such a large body of water facing a wide variety of environmental stresses cannot be put on the path of restoration without the concerted efforts of motivated stakeholders. In order to be effective, however, these stakeholders must not only be dedicated to their own goals, but more importantly, be aware of, fully understand, and support the efforts of a myriad of other goals brought to the table by other dedicated groups. While easier said than done, Lake Champlain has and will continue to benefit from the cooperation and partnerships spanning international to local venues. This monograph represents the result of one of many partnerships between the United States and Canada; specifically the 2002 Spring Symposium sponsored by the Lake Champlain Research Consortium that was hosted by the Missisquoi Bay Watershed Corporation (Corporation Bassin Versant Baie Missisquoi) at the Fort Saint-Jean Campus, May 20-23, 2002. The focus of this meeting was to bring together a wide variety of stakeholders to not only learn about new developments and research in the basin, but to forge new and stronger bonds for future cooperation and management of this truly great lake",

            "abstract": "Fiber-to-the-Home Technologies is fundamentally based on all the variable factors of development and advancement of the promising technology of FTTH, which is or going to be the key broadband telecom access technique to the end users. The optical technological issues cover from network architectures to component development and integration, including analysis of the transported signals and survey of the FTTH projects and the standards, with the aim to obtain a broad analysis of all technical elements and concepts involved in near future deployment. FTTH is the key true broadband telecom access technique to the end-users. It is lately gaining a practical high interest as enabling technological limitations are being solved, in a cost-effective way. While access network deployment based on fiber is becoming comparable in cost to competing technologies (and even cheaper in some scenarios), the great difference on performances and future-proof technology, makes today the fiber an attractive choice. The increasing interest for new broadband IP services like bi-directional video communications between individuals will be only efficiently supported in its full quality by the optical media. The text represents a prospect of future in access networks. Considering their direct impact in both the end-users and operators or service-providers, we consider it can bring a new era, generating new perspectives and jobs. Fiber-to-the-Home Technologies tries to make people know about the existence and incredible perspectives of Fiber-to-the-Home. As a conclusion, the presented techno-economical advances in all-optical access networks in this text, both in research and commercial levels, reveal that Fiber-To-The-Home can feasibly progress from the research stage to the massive commercial field in a hopefully short-term period. Even today, the analysis leads the fiber to be considered as the right medium choice in new access network deployment for new operators",

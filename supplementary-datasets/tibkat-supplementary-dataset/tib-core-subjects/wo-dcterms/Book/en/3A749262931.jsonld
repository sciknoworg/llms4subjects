            "title": "Infrared Astronomy with Arrays : The Next Generation",
            "abstract": "This book reveals the remarkable revolution which has occurred in infrared astronomy in recent years as the result of technology breakthroughs in the development and availability of tiny imaging devices known as `arrays'. The book contains the proceedings of a conference at the University of California, Los Angeles in July 1993 at which about 300 participants from all over the world met to discuss the progress and astronomical applications of infrared array detectors. A key feature of the book is the mix of papers describing the detector technology, astronomical instruments or observational methods, with those describing the latest, exciting astrophysical conclusions based on measurements made with the new arrays. In many cases, the images and spectra shown were spectacular, and it was difficult to appreciate that the results were for infrared rather than optical wavelengths. Astronomers, instrument designers and representatives of the infrared detector industry were all present. Reviews of the state-of-the-art in near infrared imaging and spectroscopy and mid-to-far infrared imaging and spectroscopy from ground-based observatories are mixed with reviews of planned space missions such as HST-second generation instruments, ISO, and SIRTF. Prospects for IR astronomy from Antarctica are also described. Finally, the first infrared astronomical science from the 10-m W.M. Keck Telescope is described. Also, numerous astronomical results and new instrumentation ideas are summarized in over 100 poster papers. This book provides an invaluable reference work and an excellent introduction for all astronomers to the rapidly growing field of infrared astronomy. Scientific topics range from studies of solar system objects to galaxies at very high redshifts, and include almost everything in between e.g., star forming regions, the Galactic Center, globular clusters, starburst galaxies and cosmology. Only a few years ago none of these studies would have been possible",

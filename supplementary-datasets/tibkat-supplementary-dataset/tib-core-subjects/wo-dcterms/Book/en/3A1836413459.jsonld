            "abstract": "Cultural Revolutions argues that reason itself is cultural, but no less reasonable for it. Lawrence Cahoone systematically defines culture and gauges the consequences of the ineradicably cultural nature of cognition and action, yet argues that none of this implies relativism. Cahoone offers a definition of culture as teleologically organized practices, artifacts, and narratives and analyzes the notion of cultural membership in relation to race, ethnicity, and \u201cprimordialism.\u201d He provides a theory of culture\u2019s role in how we form our sense of reality and argues that the proper conception of culture dissolves \u201cthe problem\u201d of cultural relativism.   Applying this perspective to Islamic fundamentalism, Cahoone identifies its conflict with the West as representing the break between two of three historically distinctive forms of reason. Rather than being \u201cirrational,\u201d he shows, fundamentalism embodies a rationality only recently devalued\u2014but not entirely abandoned\u2014by the West",

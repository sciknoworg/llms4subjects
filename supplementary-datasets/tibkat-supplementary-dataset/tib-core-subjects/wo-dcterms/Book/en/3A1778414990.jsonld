            "title": "Fluid Interfaces",
            "abstract": "Fluid interfaces are promising candidates for confining different types of materials, e.g., polymers, surfactants, colloids, and even small molecules, to be used in designing new functional materials with reduced dimensionality. The development of such materials requires a deepening of the physicochemical bases underlying the formation of layers at fluid interfaces as well as on the characterization of their structures and properties. This is of particular importance because the constraints associated with the assembly of materials at the interface lead to the emergence of equilibrium and features of dynamics in the interfacial systems, which are far removed from those conventionally found in traditional materials. This Special Issue is devoted to studies on the fundamental and applied aspects of fluid interfaces, and attempts to provide a comprehensive perspective on the current status of the research field",

            "abstract": "This book, entitled Radio Frequency Identification Fundamentals and Applications, Bringing Research to Practice, bridges the gap between theory and practice and brings together a variety of research results and practical solutions in the field of RFID. The book is a rich collection of articles written by people from all over the world: teachers, researchers, engineers, and technical people with strong background in the RFID area. Developed as a source of information on RFID technology, the book addresses a wide audience including designers for RFID systems, researchers, students and anyone who would like to learn about this field. At this point I would like to express my thanks to all scientists who were kind enough to contribute to the success of this project by presenting numerous technical studies and research results. However, we couldn\u2019t have published this book without the effort of InTech team. I wish to extend my most sincere gratitude to InTech publishing house for continuing to publish new, interesting and valuable books for all of us",

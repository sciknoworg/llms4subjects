            "title": "Building Better Learning Environments in the Philippines",
            "abstract": "Evidence from around the world has shown that improving school infrastructure leads to better learning outcomes. For example, a 2011 review of the economics literature over the last 20 years showed that the availability of basic school infrastructure (such as classrooms, desks, and chairs) and facilities (such as electricity, libraries, and blackboards) is frequently associated with better student learning achievement. These findings have been backed up by a systematic review of recent impact evaluations, which showed that infrastructure investments have a positive impact on school enrollment rates, attendance rates, and learning achievement. Also, research in the Philippines has shown that reducing the number of students per classroom is associated with better student learning outcomes, particularly in rural schools. The purpose of this policy note is to provide a snapshot of the state of existing school infrastructure in the Philippines and to assess the government systems that build and repair school buildings and facilities. The findings come from a comprehensive survey of the public education system carried out for the Philippines Public Education Expenditure Tracking and Quantitative Service Delivery Study (PETS-QSDS) that tracked public education expenditure and assessed the quality of education services. In assessing government systems, it primarily focused on projects managed by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), which is responsible for the bulk of school infrastructure projects",

            "abstract": "There have been many iterations of the Joan of Arc story: \u201ctestimonies,\u201d books, and films have attempted to capture the drama of one of history\u2019s most famous gender warriors. But few, if any, have been undertaken by an author who met her subject matter with such recognition and insight, a fellow warrior, a rebel in kind. kari edwards, a transgender activist and key figure in the Bay Area experimental writing scene of the late 1990s and early 2000s, was provocative and prescient in her concern for the way that language inflects, inflicts, and regulates gender norms. Her persistent efforts to break linguistic binaries and barriers have given her texts an ongoing urgency after her untimely death in 2006.  This book brings to life an important document discovered in the late poet\u2019s archive at the Poetry Collection at the University of Buffalo. The several notebooks and partial typescript (as well as various plans and notes) of edwards\u2019 unfinished d\u00f4Nrm\u2019-l\u00e4-p\u00fcsl, uncovered by Tina \u017digon, offer an intriguing glimpse of a major new direction in edwards\u2019 work, one in which her avant-garde instincts are channeled through rigorous research on this medieval figure. In this retelling \u2013 better to say \u201cremixing\u201d \u2013 of Joan of Arc\u2019s fateful trial and martyrdom, we find the major theme so richly laced throughout edwards\u2019 oeuvre: the courageous (but also depressingly mundane) struggle against the stifling regulation of language, appearance, and norms. edwards\u2019s Joan of Arc, even in its incomplete and abbreviated form (which \u017digon calls a \u201cpossible version\u201d of edwards\u2019s manuscript), offers an exciting engagement with one of the medieval period\u2019s most challenging and mysterious figures",

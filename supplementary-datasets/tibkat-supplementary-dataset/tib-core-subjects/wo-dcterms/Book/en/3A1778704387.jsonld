            "abstract": "The main goal in compiling this book was to highlight the situation in Africa in terms of AIDS and opportunistic diseases. Several chapters reveal great poverty, an apocalyptic situation in many parts of Africa. Global migration of people resulted in their exposure to pathogens from all over the world. This fact has to be acknowledged and accepted as African reality. New, unconventional hypotheses, not determined by established dogmas, have been incorporated into the book, although they have not yet been sufficiently validated experimentally. It still applies that any dogma in any area of science, and medicine in particular, has and always will hinder progress. According to some biologists, in the future, AIDS is very likely to occur in a number of variations, as a direct result of the ongoing processes in the global human society. Thus, we urgently need a comprehensive solution for AIDS, in order to be ready to fight other, much more dangerous intruders",

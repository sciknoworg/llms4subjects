The expanded and updated edition explores new and emerging ideas, themes, and findings, including the latest research from neuroscience and developmental psychology.

Chapters discuss a wide range of topics including assessment, the role of family in nurturing talent, and issues specific to subgroups such as disadvantaged gifted children and gifted children with special needs. In addition, the handbook provides guidelines for creating relevant interventions and designing curriculum for this diverse population. Topics featured in the Handbook include: \u00b7 The social and emotional world of the gifted. \u00b7 Emotional intelligence and the gifted. \u00b7 Perfectionism in gifted students. \u00b7 Depression and suicide among gifted children. \u00b7 Career counseling for the gifted and talented. \u00b7 Best practices in the identification and assessment of the gifted. The Handbook of Giftedness in Children, Second Edition is a must-have resource for researchers, clinicians and related professionals, policy makers, and graduate students across such interrelated disciplines as child and school psychology, social work, and education policy and politics as well as special and general education, public health, school nursing, occupational therapy, psychiatry, school counseling, and family studies"

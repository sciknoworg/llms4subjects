            "title": "Aspects in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy",
            "abstract": "Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a slow and smooth continuous extracorporeal blood purification process. It is usually implemented over 24 hours to several days with gentle removal of fluid overload and excess uremic toxins. CRRT, which is based on the physiological principles of diffusion, ultrafiltration, convection, and adsorption, can be performed as slow continuous ultrafiltration, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration, and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis. Over many years, CRRT has been shown to be an effective dialysis therapy for hemodynamically unstable patients with acute kidney injury, brain injury, and/or multiorgan failure in intensive care units. Aspects in CRRT covers selected important topics with a practical approach to the management of different aspects of CRRT. All chapters have been updated and are well referenced, supported by well-illustrated figures and tables, and written by distinguished and experienced authors. Aspects in CRRT is considered as a guide to daily practice in intensive care units, and a reference for medical and nursing staff involved in taking care of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury, sepsis, and multiorgan failure",

            "abstract": "Home, and therefore homelessness, can have different meanings according to one\u2018s background but it mandates a sensitive response. An adequate approach to it should be insightful of its implications, and so, a common understanding of the term was formulated. Through brainstorming (see Fig. 1) the team in charge of the topic defined homelessness as the lack of physical shelter and social relations that support the dignity of life. At the same time, the relation with dignity of life included: a good quality of physical shelter (by keeping up with hygiene standards, providing adequate protection from environment, and having access to all essential services); the possibility to access health facilities; the existence of economic opportunities; and access to and positive participation in a social network (for a feeling of belonging and good relations with others). It was also noticed that a homelessness situation could happen during different periods and because of many reasons, but it becomes especially concerning when such case strikes suddenly and persists for long. In Athens, after the lengthened economic crisis of 2013, about 9,100 people experienced some form of visible homelessness in the wider metropolitan area (ANDRIOPOULOU et al. 2017: p. 2). Despite the significant deterioration in the problem, no changes in the policy have been made - the current range of policies working in the issue focus on the management of its most extreme and publicly visible manifestations (KOURACHANIS 2015: p. 123), leaving a need for new responses to the issue. New strategies should have a more conscious approach of the matter and, furthermore, they need to be a milestone in building social resilience so that future crisis can be overcome faster.",

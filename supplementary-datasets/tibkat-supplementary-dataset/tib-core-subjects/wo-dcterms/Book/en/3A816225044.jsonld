Drawing on Whitley\u2019s Theory of Scientific Change, the study analysed the degree of \u2018professionalisation\u2019 of the Information Systems Discipline, the overarching research question being \u2018To what extent is Information Systems a distinct and mature discipline in Australia?\u2019The book chapters are structured around three main sections: a) the context of the study; b) the state case studies; and c) Australia-wide evidence and analysis. The book is crafted to be accessible to IS and non-IS types both within and outside of Australia. It represents a \u2018check point\u2019; a snapshot at a point in time. As the first in a hoped for series of such snap-shots, it includes a brief history of IS in Australia, bringing us up to the time of this report.The editorial team comprises Guy Gable, architect and leader; Bob Smyth, project manager; Shirley Gregor, sponsor, host and co-theoretician; Roger Clarke, discipline memory; and Gail Ridley, theoretician. In phase two, the editors undertook to examine each component study, with a view to arriving at an Australia-wide perspective",

            "title": "Chapter 10 Transformations of the Media Sphere : Amplifying Opportunity Structures for Populism",
            "abstract": "This book explores the mechanisms and elements of populism to develop new theoretical and methodological approaches. Much as populism has been researched, it remains a contested notion without coherent de\ufb01nition and methodology and shaped by dimensions such as ideology, communication style, discourse, mobilization, and organization. It has simultaneously mobilized emotions, produced symbols, a\ufb00ected subjectivity and gender relations, and can manifest itself in di\ufb00erent ways and appear in hybrid forms, such as in the cases of Silvio Berlusconi, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and Donald Trump. International expert contributors explore how such a variety of phenomena can be explained and analyzed, expanding the scope of populism research by proposing a multidimensional and complex understanding of populism. They argue for a greater epistemological di\ufb00erentiation and propose a methodology that integrates di\ufb00erent \ufb01elds of politics. This complex approach makes it possible to analyze populism as a multifaceted phenomenon and to understand how populisms a\ufb00ect politics and society. Aimed at postgraduates and researchers in populism as well as scholars in political science and sociology, media, communication, cultural, gender, and global studies, the volume also contributes to a better understanding of manifestations of right-wing and authoritarian populism in the twenty-\ufb01rst century",

            "abstract": "In this book, nine papers focusing on different fields of power electronics are gathered, all of which are in line with the present trends in research and industry. Given the generality of the Special Issue, the covered topics range from electrothermal models and losses models in semiconductors and magnetics to converters used in high-power applications. In this last case, the papers address specific problems such as the distortion due to zero-current detection or fault investigation using the fast Fourier transform, all being focused on analyzing the topologies of high-power high-density applications, such as the dual active bridge or the H-bridge multilevel inverter. All the papers provide enough insight in the analyzed issues to be used as the starting point of any research. Experimental or simulation results are presented to validate and help with the understanding of the proposed ideas. To summarize, this book will help the reader to solve specific problems in industrial equipment or to increase their knowledge in specific fields",

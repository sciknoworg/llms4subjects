            "abstract": "The two fields of knowledge \u201cgeology\u201d and \u201chydrology\u201d always go hand in hand, often giving rise to the terms \u201cgeohydrology\u201d and \u201chydrogeology.\u201d The importance of the science of water, commonly called \u201chydrologic science,\u201d is always complemented by the \u201cscience of the interior of the earth.\u201d Whereas hydrology is concerned with the quality and quantity of underground water, its movement, extraction, and recharge, geology talks of the rock matrix and the structure in which this water is contained, stored, and moved around.In recent times, the knowledge of geohydrology or the hydrology of groundwater has gained an impetus many times its original scale; and with that, acquisition, expansion, research, advancement, and dissemination of this knowledge have become more significant. With so many dimensions of geohydrology available for exploration, research, and technological advancement, any work contributing to any dimension of geohydrology and groundwater will find its right place. This compilation of chapters is going to play a very important part in furthering the knowledge of geohydrology and may prove an interesting and useful read for various cross-sections of academia, researchers, engineers, hydrologists, and all categories of water consumers",

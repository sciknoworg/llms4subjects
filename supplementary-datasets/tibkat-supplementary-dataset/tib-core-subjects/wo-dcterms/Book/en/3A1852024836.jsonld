            "abstract": "\"Port engineering primarily deals with the design, construction, operation, management, and maintenance of ports, overlapping with many other disciplines. This book provides an introductory text to prospective (graduate) port engineers and presents a wide variety of port subjects for practicing engineers. It covers all topics related to port engineering in a fundamental way including dredging, aids to navigation, marinas, environmental issues, and dry bulk, general cargo, multi-purpose, Ro-Ro and, ferry terminals. Discussions targeted at a conceptual design level are augmented by examples and case studies. Features: Covers all aspects of port engineering including maritime trade, environmental aspects, port management, and so forth. Illustrates design of port terminals. Discusses site selection for a new port, the factors to be considered and ways to compare different potential port sites. Explores asset registers and individual asset maintenance plans. Includes case studies, examples, and practical and user-friendly guidelines. This book is aimed at graduate students in port engineering or more specifically: port design, port planning, terminal design, marinas, dredging, port maintenance, shipping and maritime trade, aids to navigation, and transport engineering\"--",

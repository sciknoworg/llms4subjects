            "abstract": "This is the latest book in a series of cardiovascular-related texts from IntechOpen Publishing. The present volume considers general aspects of cardiac disease and is divided into three distinct sections covering cardiac risk, cardiorenal pathology, and novel interventional surgical techniques. The chapters offer insight into the current state of the art with respect to the risks of developing cardiovascular diseases, maintenance of patent vascular access in patients with the cardiorenal syndrome, and a plethora of novel interventional technologies all aimed at salvaging damaged tissue and improving prognosis and reducing mortality. This volume of 18 chapters is intended for general medical and biomedical students at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. It also offers insightful updates on recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiac diseases and the new techniques added to the medical armamentarium to improve the outcomes and prevent mortality and would be of interest to those working in academia and healthcare science",

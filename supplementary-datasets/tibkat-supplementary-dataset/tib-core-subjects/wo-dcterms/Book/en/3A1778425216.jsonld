            "title": "Chapter 3 D. Natsagdorj, Mongolian travel writing, and ideas about national identity",
            "abstract": "In 1927, upon his arrival in Berlin, D. Natsagdorj, one of approximately 45 young Mongolian students who participated in an educational program in Germany and France, composed a long travel poem, \u201cNotes on the Trip to Berlin.\u201d Not only does this poem serve as an early example of Natsagdorj\u2019s writing, it emphasizes Natsagdorj\u2019s role as a didactic writer for the early Mongolian People\u2019s Republic, in particular in conveying the values of the cosmopolitan socialist, a modern subjectivity that quite consciously separated itself from the previous aristocratic, Buddhist, and pastoral identities of pre-revolutionary Mongolia. \u201cNotes on the Trip to Berlin\u201d provides a geographical orientation of the new economic and cultural flows from Mongolia to Western Europe through the Soviet Union. Natsagdorj\u2019s poem is also significant because it is one of the few examples of Mongolian travel literature and enables Natsagdorj to actively resist the image of Mongolians perpetuated by Western travel writers. From the perspective of Natsagdorj\u2019s Mongolian readers, \u201cNotes on the Trip to Berlin\u201d teaches them the process of navigating socialist and pre-revolutionary identities as Natsagdorj grapples with socialist and pre-revolutionary literary forms and language",

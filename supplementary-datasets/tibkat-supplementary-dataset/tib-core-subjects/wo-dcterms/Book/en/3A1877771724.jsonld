            "abstract": "This open access book examines the depiction of Korean history in recent South Korean historical films. Released over the Hallyu (\u201cKorean Wave\u201d) period starting in the mid-1990s, these films have reflected, shaped, and extended the thriving public discourse over national history. In these works, the balance between fate and freedom\u2014the negotiation between societal constraints and individual will, as well as cyclical and linear history\u2014functions as a central theme, subtext, or plot device for illuminating a rich variety of historical events, figures, and issues. In sum, these highly accomplished films set in Korea\u2019s past address universal concerns about the relationship between structure and agency, whether in collective identity or in individual lives. Written in an engaging and accessible style by an established historian, Fate and Freedom in Korean Historical Films offers a distinctive perspective on understanding and appreciating Korean history and culture",

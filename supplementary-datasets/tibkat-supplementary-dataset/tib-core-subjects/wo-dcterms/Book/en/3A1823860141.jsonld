                "This proceedings volume convenes peer-reviewed, selected papers presented at the XXVIII International Joint Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IJCIEOM) that was held in Mexico City, Mexico, July 17-20, 2022, with a special focus on applications of industrial engineering and operations management for research and practice. Fields covered include operations, manufacturing, industrial and production engineering and management, emphasizing optimization models and data science applications to real-world problems. In this book, the reader will find works on topics as optimization models; stochastic optimization; digital transformation in the supply chain; data science applications in operations management; Industry 4.0: manufacturing planning & control; blockchain; intelligent transportation systems; sustainable and reverse logistics; big data and demand planning; predictive and prescriptive analytics; last-mile delivery optimization; stochastic inventory models; new trends in information technology for operation management; stochastic optimization; optimization models for omnichannel; safety in operation management; and more. This volume includes relevant information for academics, since most of the chapters focus on real-world case studies and systematic reviews, but also for professionals in the industrial sector as it presents solutions to complex industrial challenges. Previous 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 IJCIEOM proceedings can also be found in Springer's catalog.",

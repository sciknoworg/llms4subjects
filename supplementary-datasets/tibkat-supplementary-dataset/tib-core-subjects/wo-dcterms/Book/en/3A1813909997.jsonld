            "abstract": "\"Fundamentals of Thermal Spraying discusses the thermal spraying concept and its uses are explained elaborately. Starting from the historical development of thermal spraying, the book is very comprehensive and pitching more for an informed reader. Herein, self-explaining schematics highlight the conceptual notes and depicting the concept deeply for better understanding for the graduates of Materials Science and Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Production & Manufacturing Engineering, Design Program. It also aims at the staff of companies that are specifically working on surface engineering with thermal spraying. The chapters are pitched with schematics and keeping undergraduate students in mind for its adoption as a textbook. Each aspect from starting powder, spraying parameters, diagnostics and coating deposition provided an in-depth understanding. The major parts of the instrumentation, spraying gun which is the fundamental aspect of the different thermal spraying conditions are discussed as well. The solved examples, numerical problems and descriptive questions are included for self-assessment for the purpose of self-learning. The important case studies from aerospace, biomedical, manufacturing, wettability, etc. domains are highlighted with practical application of the thermally sprayed coatings. Thus, it can impact the readers to inspire and involve in the research and development in the thermal spray coatings\"--",

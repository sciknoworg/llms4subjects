                "\u2018Marchetti offers an original reading of Italian foreign policy as \u201chybrid diplomacy\u201d grounded in an extensive analysis of eight relevant case studies where partnerships between government (in particular the MFA) and civil society have been crucial in producing a successful human rights or humanitarian outcome. The list of interviewees makes for a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of Italian foreign policy and is a testimony to the original quality of the research. No doubts in the land of Machiavelli many would be sceptical of Marchetti\u2019s argument, but this is a must-read nevertheless for all those interested in the changing nature of foreign policy and IR and the unexpected surprising resources of the Bel Paese!\u2019 \u2013Fabio Petito, University of Sussex, UK, and ISPI, Italy \u2018Marchetti\u2019s book is an admirable dissection of the relationship between non-state actors (NSAs) and Italian foreign policy. The theoretical focus is the growing presence of non-state actors in IR, and the hybrid quality of their relations with state actors. Specifically, and with particular reference to Italy, he emphasises that the relationship is not one-sided, but hybrid, with gains for both states, for which NSAs act as force-multipliers, and for NSAs which receive greater access to policy-making. The argument that these relations are synergistic is a welcome corrective to the general assumption that these relations are antagonistic.\u2019 \u2013Neil MacFarlane, University of Oxford, UK This book explores a new way of doing diplomacy through the engagement with non-governmental organizations, here referred to as hybrid diplomacy. Today\u2019s global politics is played out most successfully by the combined actions of different actors. A specific type of partnership is that between governments and civil society organizations, which is particularly effective in advancing new issues and promoting the norm changes that have been discussed at length in IR and sociological literatures. Italy, as a middle power with a strong non-profit sector, is well positioned to take advantage of this diplomatic mode.

            "abstract": "It is assumed that the impact of natural and man-made hazards on society in terms of damage cannot be avoided. To reduce potential disaster levels and to assess which policies have had a positive outcome, a careful comparison should take place on the procedures implemented in the management of crises. The experiences with the earthquakes in the Pianura Padana area and central regions of Italy in the last ten years have been incorporated in the 'After the Damages' advanced training project. This project aims to showcase recent innovations and advancements in post-disaster management, so as to take a more proactive role in post-disaster management, and to respond more effectively when disasters occur. This volume provides insights into the dynamics and negative effects of natural and man-made hazards (i.e., earthquakes, fires, floods, droughts, volcanic eruptions, etc.), including more updated approaches to deal with post-disaster phases. The book also offers tools to deal with possible international crisis scenarios and mitigate the social impact of vulnerabilities through risk reduction. Built Heritage in post-Disaster Scenarios aims at public administration managers, government agency representatives, international organizations, researchers, and professionals in architecture, engineering, and earth science.

            "abstract": "The is the first book to document the highly innovative Terminal in Hong Kong, completed in 2018, with a rare glimpse at all stages of plans, design, and construction. Located centrally in Hong Kong, this is the largest below ground station in the world. The high-speed rail terminus station will connect Hong Kong to Beijing with the largest rail network in history, expected to strengthen the city s strategic position as the southern gateway of China. West Kowloon Station enjoys a spectacular location with a panoramic view of the Hong Kong skyline, but when Bromberg s team entered the competition to design it, they encountered a problem the station is mostly 100 feet belowground. His solution was to ensure the station was civic-minded and to create a large volume capped by a shell-like dome that rises from the earth, capturing daylight and sending it deep underground. This book contains never-before-seen sketches, models, renderings, drawings, and all-new photography of the building as well as an interview with the architect",

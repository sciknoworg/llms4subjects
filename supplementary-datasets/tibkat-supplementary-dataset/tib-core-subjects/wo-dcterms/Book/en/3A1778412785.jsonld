            "title": "Chapter Spatial Estimation of Soil Erosion Risk Using RUSLE/GIS Techniques and Practices Conservation Suggested for Reducing Soil Erosion in Wadi Mina Catchment (Northwest, Algeria)",
            "abstract": "To meet the pressing water needs in Algeria, the state has put in place a strategy consisting of the creation of hydraulic infrastructure for the mobilization of surface water resources. In fact, 74 dams are currently in operation; these structures are silting up at a rapid pace, generating an estimated annual loss of 45 million m3. Sidi Mhamed Benaouda dam located in the Oranian hill, with a water capacity of respectively 241 million m3 plays a crucial economic role in this region. The protection of this dam against erosive processes is a pressing economic goal. To do this, the RUSLE/GIS approach was used to map the erosive hazard. The results obtained in the Mina catchment, following a subdivision of 1315 homogeneous land parcels, show a total annual loss of 60 million tons/year with an average loss of 11.2 t/ha/year. About 50% of the catchment area was predicted to have very low to low erosion risk, with soil loss between 0 and 7.4 t/ha/year. Erosion risk is moderate over 13.9% of the catchment, where calculated soil loss is between 7.4 and 12 t/ha/year. Erosion risk is high to dangerous over 36.1% of the catchment, where calculated soil loss is more than 12 t/ha/year. According to this study, it appeared clearly that we must intervene quickly by using reliable and effective conservation techniques",

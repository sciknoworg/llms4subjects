                "For this invaluable collection, Professor Link has selected the most significant articles that have emerged in the last fifty years in the field of innovation policy. The first volume addresses the foundations of innovation policy and covers essential topics such as governments' role in innovation, the patent system and fiscal policies that promote innovation. The second volume explores specific innovation policies and their social impact, including public research and development, the changing role of universities in the innovation process and technology transfer policies. In his introduction, Professor Link offers an authoritative and insightful overview of innovation policy in industrialized nations, identifying at least two paradigms that motivate governments' role in innovation policy"

            "abstract": "\"This new volume presents an array of new and emerging techniques in the food processing sector, focusing on the extraction, encapsulation, and health benefits of bioactive Compounds. It illustrates various applications of novel food processing extraction and encapsulation techniques along with the health and safety aspects of plant-derived bioactive compounds and functional foods Some of the sustainable and green extraction techniques discussed include novel extraction techniques, such as microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasonic assisted extraction (UAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), and rapid solid-liquid extraction (RSLE). The volume also covers the principles and methods of encapsulation, its role and application in protection and stabilization and as a targeted delivery system for enhanced nutritional health benefits. Various encapsulation methods, such as spray drying, spray cooling/chilling, fluidized bed coating, coacervation, liposome entrapment, extrusion, inclusion complexation, etc., are discussed in detail for application in the food industry. Novel Processing Methods for Plant-Based Health Foods: Extraction, Encapsulation, and Health Benefits of Bioactive Compounds also highlights the potential of nutraceuticals and biological active compounds in human health, various sources, consumers' acceptance, safety aspects, and their application in development of functional foods\"--",

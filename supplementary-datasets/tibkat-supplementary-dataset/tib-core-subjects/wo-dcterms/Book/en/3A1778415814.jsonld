            "abstract": "In the current age of information explosion, newly invented technological sensors and software are now tightly integrated with our everyday lives. Many sensor processing algorithms have incorporated some forms of computational intelligence as part of their core framework in problem-solving. These algorithms have the capacity to generalize and discover knowledge for themselves and to learn new information whenever unseen data are captured. The primary aim of sensor processing is to develop techniques to interpret, understand, and act on information contained in the data. The interest of this book is in developing intelligent signal processing in order to pave the way for smart sensors. This involves the mathematical advancement of nonlinear signal processing theory and its applications that extend far beyond traditional techniques. It bridges the boundary between theory and application, developing novel theoretically inspired methodologies targeting both longstanding and emergent signal processing applications. The topics range from phishing detection to integration of terrestrial laser scanning, and from fault diagnosis to bio-inspired filtering. The book will appeal to established practitioners, along with researchers and students in the emerging field of smart sensor signal processing",

            "abstract": "This volume argues that relational realism can help us to make better educational policy that is more effective in practice. Basem Adi draws on critical realism to thoroughly re-examine fundamental assumptions about how government policymaking works, developing an ontological basis from which to examine existing government approaches and imagine an alternative approach based on a relational realist-informed critical pedagogy.  Adi casts familiar issues in a new light by drawing on a less familiar theoretical and meta-theoretical tradition, offering a critique that can be productively engaged with by many educational organizations to tackle the issues they face.  A Relational Realist Vision for Education Policy and Practice will be of great interest to academics of sociology, critical realism, sociological theory and education, as well as policymakers and educators seeking a theoretical perspective on their work",

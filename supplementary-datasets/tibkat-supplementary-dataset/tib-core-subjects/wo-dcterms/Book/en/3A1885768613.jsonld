            "abstract": "Arundati Roy (2020) states that historically pandemics have forced humans to  break with the past and imagine their world anew. This chapter, set in the COVID-19 pandemic, centres the importance of cognitive justice which is an essential part of the struggles for justice against domination. Cognitive justice is used as a lens to explore the case story of Cape Town Together (CTT), which was a response to COVID-19. The social movement was built, bottom up, challenging the deep racial and class divides that are a signature of Cape Town. The concept of \u2018professors of the street\u2019 emerged as part of CTT. This concept is explored by locating it within the context of the pandemic and within CTT\u2019s learning/teaching/organising practices. It is argued that \u2018professors of the street\u2019 are a provocation to challenge the dominant knowledge hierarchies that prevail \u2013 it is a metaphor for the critical importance of grassroots, local knowledge in times of \u2018crisis\u2019. The teaching/learning /organising ethos within CTT provided fertile soil for \u00abprofessors of the street\u00bb to emerge as an example of the enactment of cognitive justice within a crisis. The case story offers insights for organising for social-ecological justice in various \u2018crisis\u2019 situations",

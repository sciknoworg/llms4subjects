            "abstract": "\"In this authoritative book, Ioanna Hadjiyianni and Kleoniki Pouikli incisively map out the regulatory landscape of ship recycling, exploring the main international and European regulatory approaches that govern its environmental impacts. In light of the transnational demands of environmental justice, they critically assess the interaction between multiple regimes from the perspective of key environmental principles and the role of the EU as a global standard setter for shipbreaking. Analysing the complex business of dismantling end-of-life ships, the book takes a deeper look at the practice of shipbreaking and examines the appropriate balance between environmental protection, economic development and social justice. The authors survey the EU's role as a significant global actor on environmental protection and maritime issues, often determining the relationship between the different regimes before they are settled at the international level. They also examine the effectiveness of these regimes, as well as their legal uncertainties and jurisdictional loopholes, through the lens of environmental principles and justice and in the context of recent developments related to the European Green Deal. The Regulatory Landscape of Ship Recycling provides valuable insights for academics and postgraduate students in law, politics and environmental studies. Legal practitioners in environmental law, sustainability law, maritime and shipping law and industry actors involved in shipbreaking will equally benefit from this fundamental resource\"--",

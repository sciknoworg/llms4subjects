            "abstract": "The DC/AC microgrid system is a crucial empowering technology for the integration of various types of renewable energy sources (RES) accompanied by a smart control approach to enhance the system reliability and efficiency. This book presents cutting-edge technology developments and recent investigations performed with the help of power electronics. Large-scale renewable energy integration presents challenges and issues for power grids. In particular, these issues include microgrid adaption to RES, AC machines, the new configuration of AC/DC converters, and electrification of domestic needs with optimal cost expenses from domestic standalone microgrids. Furthermore, this book elaborates cutting-edge developments in electric vehicle fast charging configuration, battery management, and control schemes with renewable energies through hardware-in-loop testing and validation for performance durability in real-time application. Overall, the book covers the diverse field of microgrids, allowing readers to adopt new technologies and prepare for future power demands with sustainable green engineering",

            "abstract": "\"This study shows some generic characteristics from sports that are of relevance to samhandling structures under risk. The findings are based on a case study of the concept of \u201cTotal Football\u201d and the Rosenborg Football Club (RBK) in Norway. Football is a dynamic sport with several factors that come into play and where flexible solutions are demanded. The case is also of relevance for organizations in handling risk. RBK\u2019s samhandling is based on \u201cTotal Football\u201d and flow theory. In analyzing RBK, we also apply theories of improvisation. RBK created a platform that gave both direction to choices and a clear playing pattern. This platform further ensured that tasks could be executed at high speed and high intensity, described as \u201cflow\u201d. Flow contributed to both speed and precision in the playing pattern. It is concluded that the following is relevant for other organizations: 1) Forming a deeper understanding of samhandling and ensuring top management commitment; 2) Creating, establishing and maintaining samhandling in a manner that suits the organization; and 3) Minimal structures can be of great importance for organizations in unforeseen and risky situations.\"",

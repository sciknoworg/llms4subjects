Ever since it was set up at the start of the 20th century, its own transformations have run alongside those of Greek society, thanks to the determined action of all those involved. It was once frequented by tens of thousands of students and managed a vast network of subsidiary schools, today, it is an essential player in Greek cultural life: so many writers, painters, sculptors, musicians and film directors, as well as scientific researchers from every discipline have walked and continue to walk its halls. This book, based on a huge range of never-before-seen sources and archival documents, retraces the main phases of this shared history",

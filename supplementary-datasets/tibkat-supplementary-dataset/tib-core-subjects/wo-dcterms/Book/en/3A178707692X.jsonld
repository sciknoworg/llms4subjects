                "Part I of this book provides design engineers an elemental understanding of the variables that influence pressure drop and heat transfer in plain and micro-fin tubes to thermal systems using liquid single-phase flow in different industrial applications. The author and his colleagues were the first to determine experimentally the very important relationship between inlet geometry and transition. On the basis of their results, they developed practical and easy to use correlations for the isothermal and non-isothermal friction factor (pressure drop) and heat transfer coefficient (Nusselt number) in the transition region as well as the laminar and turbulent flow regions for different inlet configurations and fin geometry. The work presented in Part I of the book provides the thermal systems design engineer the necessary design tools. Part II of this book provides design engineers using gas-liquid two-phase flow in different industrial applications the necessary fundamental understanding of the two-phase flow variables. Two-phase flow literature reports a plethora of correlations for determination of flow patterns, void fraction, two- phase pressure drop and non-boiling heat transfer correlations. However, the validity of a majority of these correlations is restricted over a narrow range of two-phase flow conditions. Consequently, it is quite a challenging task for the end user to select an appropriate correlation/model for the type of two-phase flow under consideration. Selection of a correct correlation also requires some fundamental understanding of the two-phase flow physics and the underlying principles/assumptions/limitations associated with these correlations. Thus, it is of significant interest for a design engineer to have knowledge of the flow patterns and their transitions and their influence on two-phase flow variables. To address some of these issues and facilitate selection of appropriate two-phase flow models, Part II of this book presents a succinct review of the flow patterns, void fraction, pressure drop and non-boiling heat transfer phenomenon and recommend some of the well scrutinized modeling techniques. Reviews pressure drop, heat transfer coefficient, and inlet configuration effect in the transition region Includes void fraction correlations for flow patterns, pipe orientations, models for pressure drop calculations Presents non-boiling two-phase flow heat transfer correlations for different flow patterns and pipe orientations.",

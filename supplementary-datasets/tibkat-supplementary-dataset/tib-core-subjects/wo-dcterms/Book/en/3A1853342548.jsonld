            "abstract": "The article discusses Gustav Shpet\u2019s phenomenology and aesthetic theory as part of early Soviet culture. The author suggests that the \u2018official\u2019 acceptance of Shpet\u2019s philosophy, particularly through GAKhN, is emblematic of the internal complexity of the cultural regime in the 1920s. Shpet\u2019s pre-revolutionary phenomenology was praised for its modernizing potential, while his later anti-avant-garde art theory was criticized as old-fashioned and unscientific. Yet both were welcomed by Marxist thinkers and the Bolshevik regime. Shpet\u2019s involvement in Soviet culture from 1917 to 1929 can thus be seen as a reflection of its gradually changing needs. His aesthetics of \u2018new realism\u2019 and the \u2018inner form of the word\u2019 were deemed useful until the end of the 1920s, when he was finally charged with \u2018idealism\u2019 and \u2018anti-communism\u2019. Nonetheless, Shpet\u2019s neo-classical cultural conception can be considered part of a broad conservative turn that eventually led to the introduction of socialist realism",

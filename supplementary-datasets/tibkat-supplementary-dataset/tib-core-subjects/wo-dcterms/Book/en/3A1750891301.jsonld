            "abstract": "\"Mathematical modeling is both a skill and an art and must be practiced in order to maintain and enhance the ability to use those skills. Though the topics covered in this book are the typical topics of most mathematical modeling courses, this book is best used for individuals or groups who have already taken an introductory mathematical modeling course. Advanced Mathematical Modeling with Technology will be of interest to instructors and students offering courses focused on discrete modeling or modeling for decision making. Each chapter begins with a problem to motivate the reader. The problem tells \"what\" the issue is or problem that needs to be solved. In each chapter, the authors apply the principles of mathematical modeling to that problem and present the steps in obtaining a model. The key focus is the mathematical model and the technology is presented as a method to solve that model or perform sensitivity analysis. We have selected , where applicable to the content because of their wide accessibility. The authors utilize technology to build, compute, or implement the model and then analyze the it. Features: MAPLE\u00a9, Excel\u00a9, and R\u00a9 to support the mathematical modeling process. Excel templates, macros, and programs are available upon request from authors. Maple templates and example solution are also available. Includes coverage of mathematical programming. The power and limitations of simulations is covered. Introduces multi-attribute decision making (MADM) and game theory for solving problems. The book provides an overview to the decision maker of the wide range of applications of quantitative approaches to aid in the decision making process, and present a framework for decision making\"--",

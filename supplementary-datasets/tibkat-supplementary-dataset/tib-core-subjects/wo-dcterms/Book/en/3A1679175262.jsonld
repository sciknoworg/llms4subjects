            "abstract": "With Washington trapped in budget battles and partisan gridlock, cities have emerged as the best source of government innovation. Nowhere is this more visible than in New York City. Since taking office in 2002, Mayor Bloomberg has introduced a steady stream of innovative policies, from a competition to recruit a new applied sciences campus and a far-reaching sustainability plan, to micro-apartments and a first-in-the-nation Office of Financial Empowerment. Some reforms have been more successful than others, and some more widely embraced by New Yorkers, but these policy innovations have undeniably reshaped city government, improved service delivery and sparked economic growth. Yet for all of Mayor Bloomberg's achievements, many problems will remain when he exits City Hall at the end of the year. To successfully address these challenges, the next mayor will have to be as ambitious, experimental, and innovative as his or her predecessor. Over the last six months, researchers at the Center for an Urban Future and NYU Wagner interviewed nearly 200 policy experts in cities across the country and around the globe, looking for game-changing reforms that have proven effective in other cities, that are scalable in New York, and that the next mayor could implement. This report, \"Innovation and the City,\" presents 15 of the most promising reforms--from San Francisco's bold plan to establish a $50 college savings account for every kindergartener in public school, Boston's pioneering approach to remaking the 311 system for today's smartphone age, and London's ambitious experiment with crowdfunding for public infrastructure projects.

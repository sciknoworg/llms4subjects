            "abstract": "High-Speed Railways: Environmental Impact and Pollution Prevention and Control considers environmental pollution and pollution control technology in the construction and operation of high-speed rail infrastructure. In six chapters, this new volume introduces high speed rail and environmental impact, considers environmental pollution and prevention in high speed railways, and covers the prediction, measurement and prevention of key environmental aspects of the railway. The title gives engineers the means to understand and mitigate the major environmental impacts of building and operating high-speed railways in the modern world.High-speed railways offer a low-carbon and environmentally-friendly future for public railways. However, building and operating high speed railways at scale causes stress both to the environment and to people living nearby. Impacts include noise, vibration, air and water pollution, electromagnetic radiation, and solid waste from construction sites and the normal operation of the railway. In turn, analyzing the impact of high speed rail has grown in urgency",

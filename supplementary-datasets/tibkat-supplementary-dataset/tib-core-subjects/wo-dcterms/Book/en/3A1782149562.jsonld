                "\"Nanotechnology, if applied strategically and carefully, can provide sustainable solutions to many global challenges and lead us toward sustainable development. Sustainable innovations derived from nanotechnology applications can help us achieve several of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs), a set of forward-looking goals for the world to adopt in order to achieve economic, social and environmental sustainability. The world is facing challenges on all three dimensions of sustainable development--economic, social and environmental. More than one billion people are still living in extreme poverty, as income and wealth inequality are on the rise. The Covid-19 shut down of the global economy is felt most acutely in developing nations, and hundreds of millions of people who had escaped poverty over the past two decades are now being pushed back in to poverty. At the same time, unsustainable consumption and production patterns over many decades have resulted in huge economic and environmental costs as the externalities associated with these unsustainable practices have been left resolved\"--",

            "abstract": "By combating malaria with mosquito nets or building schools and providing basic sanitation, philanthropy is helping transform the developing world. Rich donors are devoting fortunes\u2014many of them earned through computer software, entertainment, and venture capitalism\u2014 to defeating poverty and improving lives, supplementing and in some cases surpassing official aid channels.From billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett to Aliko Dangote and George Soros, the titans of capitalism are backing good causes with their cash. Whether financing new vaccines, building libraries, or buying up Amazon rain forest to protect the environment, philanthropists are supporting innovations and new approaches that are changing lives and building dreams.This issue of F&D looks at the world of targeted giving and social entrepreneurship.\u201c Philanthropy\u2019s role is to get things started,\u201d says Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who is the world\u2019s most generous giver. \u201cWe used foundation funds to set up a system to make market forces work in favor of the poor.\u201d He says that catalytic philanthropy can make a big difference. \u201cGood ideas need evangelists. Forgotten communities need advocates.\u201d Former U.S. President Bill Clinton tells us that networks of creative cooperation between government, business, and civil society can get things done better to solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems.Also in this issue, Prakash Loungani profiles superstar economist Jeffrey Sachs, who helped campaign for debt relief for developing economies and championed the Millennium Development Goals. We look at how, instead of spending commodity price windfalls on physical investments, which are often sources of corruption, governments of poor countries are sometimes well advised to hand some of the income over to their citizens. We examine moves by major central banks to ease our way out of the crisis enveloping advanced economies in our Data Spotlight column, and we hear about how China\u2019s growth inspires creativity in the West",

            "abstract": "This book presents the results of the successful Sensors Special Issue on Intelligent Vehicles that received submissions between March 2019 and May 2020. The Guest Editors of this Special Issue are Dr. David Fern\u00e1ndez-Llorca, Dr. Ignacio Parra-Alonso, Dr. Iv\u00e1n Garc\u00eda-Daza and Dr. Noelia Parra-Alonso, all from the Computer Engineering Department at the University of Alcal\u00e1 (Madrid, Spain). A total of 32 manuscripts were finally accepted between 2019 and 2020, presented by top researchers from all over the world. The reader will find a well-representative set of current research and developments related to sensors and sensing for intelligent vehicles. The topics of the published manuscripts can be grouped into seven main categories: (1) assistance systems and automatic vehicle operation, (2) vehicle positioning and localization, (3) fault diagnosis and fail-x systems, (4) perception and scene understanding, (5) smart regenerative braking systems for electric vehicles, (6) driver behavior modeling and (7) intelligent sensing. We, the Guest Editors, hope that the readers will find this book to contain interesting papers for their research, papers that they will enjoy reading as much as we have enjoyed organizing this Special Issue",

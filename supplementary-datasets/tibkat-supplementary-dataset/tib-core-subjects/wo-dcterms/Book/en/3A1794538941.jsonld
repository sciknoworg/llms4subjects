This book is a collection of novel ideas and findings in these fields, published as part of the Special Issue on Control and Automation. The core focus of this issue was original ideas and potential contributions for both theory and practice. It received a total number of 21 submissions, out of which 7 were accepted. These published manuscripts tackle some novel approaches in control, including fractional order control systems, with applications in robotics, biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, vibratory systems, and wastewater treatment plants. This Special Issue has gathered a selection of novel research results regarding control systems in several distinct research areas. We hope that these papers will evoke new ideas, concepts, and further developments in the field",

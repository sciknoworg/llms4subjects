            "abstract": "In the story of the three baseball umpires, two novice umpires compete in boasting how they respect \u00abtruth\u00bb and the way things \u00abreally\u00bb are. One says, \u00abI call them the way I see them\u00bb; the other, trying to trump this remark, responds, \u00abI call them the way they are\u00bb. Then enters the third, most seasoned umpire, saying, \u00abThey aren\u2019t, until I call them\u00bb.<BR> This book deals with two widely argued issues in literature criticism today, performativity and subjectivity. How do people become who they are? What scripts do they follow when they \u00abdo\u00bb gender, race, and sexuality? Tying into speech act theories and subjectivity theories, as well as gender, race, and sexuality studies, the author explores \u2013 through the close reading of several American texts \u2013 the many ways words make \u00abthings\u00bb in literature",

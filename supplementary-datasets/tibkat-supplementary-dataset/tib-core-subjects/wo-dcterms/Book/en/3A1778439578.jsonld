            "abstract": "\"AI and the Technological Singularity: A Fallacy or a Great Opportunity\" is a collection of essays that addresses the question of whether the technological singularity\u2014the notion that AI-based computers can program the next generation of AI-based computers until a singularity is achieved, where an AI-based computer can exceed human intelligence\u2014is a fallacy or a great opportunity. The group of scholars that address this question have a variety of positions on the singularity, ranging from advocates to skeptics. No conclusion can be reached, as the development of artificial intelligence is still in its infancy, and there is much wishful thinking and imagination in this issue rather than trustworthy data. The reader will find a cogent summary of the issues faced by researchers who are working to develop the field of artificial intelligence and, in particular, artificial general intelligence. The only conclusion that can be reached is that there exists a variety of well-argued positions as to where AI research is headed",

            "abstract": "\"This book explains the principles and techniques of microwave physiological sensing and introduces fundamental results of noninvasive sensing of physiological signatures, vital signs, as well as life detection. Specifically, noninvasive microwave techniques for contact, contactless, and remote sensing of circulatory and respiratory movements and physiological volume changes are discussed. Noninvasive Physiological Measurement: Wireless Microwave Sensing, is written by a pioneering researcher in microwave noninvasive physiological sensing and leading global expert in microwave in biology and medicine. The book reviews current advances in noncontact heart and respiration rate sensing technology and measurement. It includes measurements of physiological signs and signatures from laboratory and clinical testing. The author also discusses the applicable domains and scenarios in which there is an interaction of RF and microwaves with biological matter in gas, fluid, or solid form both from the inside and outside of the human or animal body. The book also provides examples for healthcare monitoring and diagnostic applications through wearables, devices, or remote, non-contact sensors for physiological signals and signature, vital signs, and motion sensing. This book is an essential guide to understanding human body interaction with microwaves and noninvasive physiological sensing and monitoring. This book is intended for researchers and professionals in biomedical, electrical, and computer engineering with an interest in antenna, sensors, microwave, signal processing, and medical applications. It will also be of interest to healthcare professionals, technologists,\"--",

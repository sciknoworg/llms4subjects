                "This book highlights the genomic findings, observations, and analysis of DNA/RNA sequences and protein structure of the dreadful virus of this decade- COVID-19. The Corona group of viruses though known species, the strain that caused the Pandemic of 2019 is a completely new strain, belonging to the same corona family with a novel genetic make-up. This makes it a new pathogen which is causing the current outbreak leaving the global scientific community clueless of any therapeutic breakthrough. NCOV enjoys life threatening pathogenicity with mysterious genetic annotations. This book details and offers insights into its viral genetic arrangement, Virulence factors, probable mutations leading to the evolution of this new strain and more. It contains chapters on Virus evolutionary status and Genetic makeup leading to its pathogenicity which can be a new insight in understanding the nature of this clever microorganism and can pave way to the development of new drugs and Vaccines or a novel diagnostic approach for the early prognosis of the disease. A dedicated chapter on annotation of NCOV-19 virulence genes, translation of the genes to protein product, annotation of the antigenic sites on these proteins is also included. In all, this brief is a complete genomic annotation insight of NCOV-19 using AI, Data analytics and Bioinformatics analysis. In the current situation, this book is an extensive preliminary resource for Medical practitioners, Researchers, Academicians, Scientists, Biochemists, Bioinformaticians and other professionals interested in understanding the genetics of Novel Coronavirus 19, the best possible drug targets, ideal vaccine candidates and novel prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers."

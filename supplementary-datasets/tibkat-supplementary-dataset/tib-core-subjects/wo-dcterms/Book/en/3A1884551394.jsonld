                "This book outlines the global trends and new research directions of medical robotics, while also highlighting associated technical, commercial, regulatory, and economic challenges. In particular, it focuses on three areas of medical robotics: (i) robotic surgery, (ii) rehabilitation and personal assistance, and (iii) hospital automation. With improved safety, efficacy and reduced costs, robotic platforms will soon approach a tipping point, moving beyond early adopters to become part of the mainstream clinical practice, defining the future of smart hospitals and home-based patient care. This book provides an up-to-date, concise, focused, and effective overview of medical robotics, making the content suitable for readers with different technical backgrounds, including bioengineering, robotics, computer science, as well as clinical professionals. The clarity of the exposure of complex topics in simple way makes the book a unique resource for both experienced professionals and novices who approach medical robotics. As a reference for medical robot research, readers can select some chapters according to their own interests."

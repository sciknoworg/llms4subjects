            "abstract": "Within the project \"WEA-Akzeptanz\" a model for the propagation of wind turbine noise was developed using the Crank-Nicolson Parabolic Equation method. For the validation of the model, extensive measurement campaigns were carried out, which included the recording of meteorological and acoustic data. Acoustic quantities were measured at several distances to the wind turbine and under various atmospheric conditions. This data set provides ten validation cases and includes the measured and modeled propagation losses as well as the input parameters required for the modeling. The investigated wind turbine is characterized by a hub height of 119 m and a rotor diameter of 114 m. The measured and modeled sound propagation losses were determined between 178 and 535 m as well as between 178 and 845 m distance to the wind turbine. Consequently, no conclusions about the sound emission can be made from published data. The input parameters for the model were derived from the measurements. The ten validation cases particularly differ in the sound propagation direction.",

                "\"For two hundred years the provision of military security has been a central and defining function of the modern nation-state. The increasing reliance on private military and security companies in contemporary conflict marks a fundamental transformation in the organization of military violence, and it raises issues of accountability and ethics that are of particular concern to feminists. This privatization of force not only enables states to circumvent citizens' democratic control over questions of war and peace, but also undermines the claims for greater inclusion in the military sphere made by women and minority groups over the past decades. Gender and Private Security in Global Politics brings together key scholars in the emerging research area of \"critical gender studies in private security.\" These scholars contend that the privatization of military security is a deeply gendered process, with gendered underpinnings and effects. Consequently, they employ a variety of feminist perspectives, including critical, postcolonial, poststructuralist, and queer feminist perspectives, as well as a wide range of methodological approaches such as ethnography, participant-observation, genealogy, and discourse analysis, in order to consider answers to questions about how to reform and regulate private forces\"--",

This is the first book to develop an extended feminist analysis of private militaries and to draw on feminist concerns regarding power, justice and equality to consider how to reform and regulate private forces\"--"

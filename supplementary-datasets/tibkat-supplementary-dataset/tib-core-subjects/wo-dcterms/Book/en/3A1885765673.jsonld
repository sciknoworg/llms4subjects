            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions that came with it led to unprecedented disruptions in learner development and put them at risk of poor developmental outcomes. It is thus important that the extent of the disruption on their development and the support needs of learners be investigated. Researching the impact of the disruption should focus on holistic development. In this book, the authors use multiple research approaches and methods of gathering data in their respective fields to examine the impact of the disruption and determine the support needs of learners. Data gathered through the different methods are processed and findings are presented. The findings have implications for both practice and future research in the fields of inclusive education, learner support, educational psychology, movement education, Life Orientation and curriculum development",

            "abstract": "The recent earthquakes in 11 provinces in Turkiye affected the learning of more than 5 million students. The natural disasters occurred during a global economic contraction and regional conflicts just after special circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges resulted in learning losses, emotional and psychosocial damages with expensive economic consequences that is estimated at more than 3.5 percent reduction in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually if not tackled carefully and in a timely manner. These challenges require policy decisions to protect the education system and the learning and skills assets given the political commitment to build back better. This report (i) quantified the challenges, (ii) evaluated the immediate steps taken since the 6th of February by the Ministry of National Education (MoNE) and proposes an emergency response system that can be deployed during future disasters and crises, and (iii) recommends a roadmap to support the education system for recovery from the earthquake emergency. The roadmap focuses on the earthquake regions and consists of (i) institutionalizing of an integrated national program targeting education and care aiming at a strong head start for 3-, 4- and 5-years old children and support to mothers and families; (ii) supporting green and resilient reconstruction to provide a learning environment for all children; (iii) establishing a learning catching up program for acceleration and support towards learning and wellbeing of vulnerable groups; (iv) securing the skills asset for improved production and economic growth with a futuristic vision towards green and technological innovations aiming at signature programs in general secondary, vocational education, professional and higher education focusing on the skilling and reskilling agendas; and finally (v) establishing a national center of excellence for education management in emergencies",

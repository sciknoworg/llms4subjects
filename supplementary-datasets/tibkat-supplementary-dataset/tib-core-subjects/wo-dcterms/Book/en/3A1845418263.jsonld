            "abstract": "\"Develop, Deploy, and Sustain High-Performance Virtual Prototyping for Advanced R&DOrganizations must reduce time-to-market, costs, and risks while producing higher-quality products that grow ever more complex. In response, many are turning to advanced software for rapidly creating and analyzing virtual prototypes, and accurately predicting the performance and behavior of the systems they represent. This requires a deep understanding of physics-based digital engineering and high-performance computing, as well as unique organizational and management skills. Now, Douglass Post and Richard Kendall bring together knowledge that engineers, scientists, developers, and managers will need to build, deploy, and sustain these specialized applicationsincluding information previously available only in proprietary environments.Post and Kendall illuminate key issues with a detailed book-length case study based on their work at the U.S. DoD's pioneering Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments (CREATE) program, which developed eleven of the field's most advanced software tools.Students will find a detailed roadmap for planning, organizing, managing, and navigating complex organizations to successful delivery; as well as detailed descriptions of each step in the process, with clear rationales and concrete examples. The authors share detailed references, a convenient glossary and bibliography, sidebars on overcoming real-world challenges, and more. The book reviews the essentials of computational engineering and science and the pivotal role of virtual prototyping. It helps readers to:Plan and manage the paradigm shift from physical to virtual prototypingEstablish, execute, and evolve Agile processes for developing virtual prototyping softwareUnderstand and implement virtual prototyping tools and workflowsVerify and validate prototyping systems to ensure accuracy and utilityRecruit and retain a specialized workforce, and train and support usersExplore additional emerging roles for virtual prototyping\"",

                "The book will provide the first regionally widespread and thematic look at African electoral systems and antecedent issues such as electoral laws, gender, politics, violence, and youth challenges in Africa. It will enrich the discussion on four country-specific studies within a general regional framework that explains and explores a \u201chome base\u201d viewpoint of what occurs before, during and after elections. The book will bring together a discussion of diverse issues under one umbrella, which has never been done before. This book begins a discussion from an academic\u2019s and practitioner\u2019s view of elections, contrasting the intellectual discussion with the author\u2019s personal experience of practical realities on the ground. Additionally, the book will create long-standing and lasting literature that will compare elections in some of Africa's leading democratic countries, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana and Sierra Leone. Emmanuel Saffa Abdulai is Head of the Department of Law, Faculty of Law, University of Sierra Leone. He is also a civil society practitioner working on elections and leading coalitions. He is a pro-democracy activist and was chair of the Political Affairs Cluster of the African Union\u2019s Economic Social and Cultural Council monitored several elections in Africa. He led the legal review process of Sierra Leone's election laws leading to the 2023 elections. .",

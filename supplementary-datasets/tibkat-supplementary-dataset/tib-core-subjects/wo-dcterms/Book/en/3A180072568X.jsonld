Exploring genres as diverse as horror, the war movie, the Western, the costume biopic and the romantic comedy, Katarzyna Paszkiewicz interrogates questions of \u2018genre\u2019 authorship; the blurring of the borders between commercial and independent cinema and gendered discourses of (de)authorisation that operate within each sphere; \u2018male\u2019\u2013\u2018female\u2019 genre divisions; and the issue of authorial subversion in film and popular culture in a wider sense.With its focus on close analysis of the films themselves and the cultural and ideological meanings involved in the reception of genre texts authored by women, this book expands critical debates around women\u2019s cinema and offers new perspectives on how contemporary filmmakers explore the aesthetic and imaginative power of genre.\"",

                "This proceedings volume gathers selected, blinded peer-reviewed contributions presented at the XXIX International Joint Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IJCIEOM), held in Lisbon, Portugal, from June 28th to 30th, 2023. This volume focuses especially on the applications of Industrial Engineering and Operations Management for research and practice. It includes relevant information for academics since most of the chapters focus on real-world case studies and systematic reviews. It also provides valuable insights for professionals in the industrial sector by presenting solutions to complex industrial challenges. The 2023 iteration of the IJCIEOM conference had the theme \"Developing resilience in Industrial Engineering and Operations Management\" and aimed to analyze the resilience of supply chains in the post-COVID-19 era. The works published in this volume focus on how Digital Transformation (DX) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made the manufacturing and service industry more resistant to VUCA elements (i.e., volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous). Regarding DX and AI, the research specifically focused on supply chain management, project management, and Industry 4.0. Other studies explore how industrial engineering incorporated innovative and technological concepts into service and product operations. Overall, this volume provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners alike as it presents numerous relevant contributions in identifying new challenges and opportunities for industrial engineering and operations management. This conference was sponsored by renowned international industry engineering associations, particularly the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), the Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers (IISE), and the Asociaci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo de la Ingenier\u00eda de Organizaci\u00f3n (ADINGOR)."

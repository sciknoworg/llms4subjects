                "This volume presents cutting edge research from the frontiers of functional equations and analytic inequalities active fields. It covers the subject of functional equations in a broad sense, including but not limited to the following topics: Hyperstability of a linear functional equation on restricted domains Hyers\u2013Ulam\u2019s stability results to a three point boundary value problem of nonlinear fractional order differential equations Topological degree theory and Ulam\u2019s stability analysis of a boundary value problem of fractional differential equations General Solution and Hyers-Ulam Stability of Duo Trigintic Functional Equation in Multi-Banach Spaces Stabilities of Functional Equations via Fixed Point Technique Measure zero stability problem for the Drygas functional equation with complex involution Fourier Transforms and Ulam Stabilities of Linear Differential Equations Hyers\u2013Ulam stability of a discrete diamond\u2013alpha derivative equation Approximate solutions of an interesting new mixed type additive-quadratic-quartic functional equation. The diverse selection of inequalities covered includes Opial, Hilbert-Pachpatte, Ostrowski, comparison of means, Poincare, Sobolev, Landau, Polya-Ostrowski, Hardy, Hermite-Hadamard, Levinson, and complex Korovkin type. The inequalities are also in the environments of Fractional Calculus and Conformable Fractional Calculus. Applications from this book's results can be found in many areas of pure and applied mathematics, especially in ordinary and partial differential equations and fractional differential equations. As such, this volume is suitable for researchers, graduate students and related seminars, and all science and engineering libraries. The exhibited thirty six chapters are self-contained and can be read independently and interesting advanced seminars can be given out of this book"

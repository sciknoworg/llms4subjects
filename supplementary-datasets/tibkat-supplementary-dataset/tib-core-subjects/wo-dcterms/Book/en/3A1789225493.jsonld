            "abstract": "If you are studying forensic science, or a related course such as forensic chemistry or biology, then this book will be an  indispensable companion throughout your entire degree programme. This \u2018one-stop  text will guide you through the wide range  of practical, analytical and data handling skills that you will need during your studies. It will also give you a solid grounding in the  wider transferable skills such as teamwork and study skills.  This third edition of Practical Skills in  Forensic Science builds upon the excellent foundation of its predecessors and provides an easy-to-read guide to help you develop  the skills you need to succeed. It retains the key features of earlier editions, with a layout that explains the essential elements of  practical techniques and procedures in a step-by-step manner to help you understand their application in the context of forensic science.  Features include:  Coverage of a wide range of practical aspects from fingerprint recovery, trace evidence  examination, bodily fluid examination and DNA analysis, as well as broader skills such as tackling numerical problems and passing exams. Case examples, guidelines for documentation and reporting results, plus advice on the legal aspects of forensic science provide  you with an understanding of the professional role of a forensic scientist. New material on personal development planning, learning styles, e-learning and avoiding plagiarism. Updated sections on software for graphical and statistical analysis. Worked examples and \u2018How To  boxes provide practical guidance and support. Key points highlight critical features of methodology. Use of margin tips, definitions and illustrations throughout. Additional sources of further study identified for every chapter. Safety notes highlight specific hazards and appropriate practical steps to minimise risk.  Study exercises (and answers) in each chapter help to reinforce learning.

            "abstract": [
                "This book traces the rise of the far right AfD from its inception in 2013 to its re-election to the Bundestag in 2021, emphasizing the party\u2019s nature as a \u201cpopulist issue entrepreneur\u201d and covering the three major crises that have shaken European party politics \u2013 the Eurozone crisis, the so-called refugee crisis, and the COVID pandemic. Currently, books on the topic of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) are largely limited to historical treatments and surface level analyses of the political party. This volume has the virtue of being both empirically rigorous as well as conceptually nuanced: it seeks to understand the party\u2019s political trajectory and attraction to supporters by analyzing its voters using advanced quantitative methodologies, as well as interpreting the party\u2019s communication strategies through mixed empirical methods. It embeds this account within a theoretically well-grounded argument. The argument emphasizes three important explanatory conditions \u2013 a favorable political opportunity structure, issue entrepreneurship, and the party\u2019s stages of political development. Michael A. Hansen is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Turku, Finland. He previously held a Postdoctoral position at Lund University and was an Assistant Professor at University of Wisconsin Parkside. Jonathan Olsen is Professor and Chair, Department of Social Sciences and Historical Studies at Texas Woman's University, USA.",

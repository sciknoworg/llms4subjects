            "title": "Evaluation of Harm Reduction Service Delivery in Cebu City, Philippines (2013-2015)",
            "abstract": "The Kamagayan Comprehensive Care Center (KC3) clients report being very satisfied with the comprehensive package of health services offered under the BCP and they feel welcome and accepted at the KC3. Community members in Kamagayan, including family members of the KC3 clients, also praise the service as an excellent intervention. Virtually all key stakeholders interviewed noted that the KC3 team had performed especially well in building trust between clients and their health service providers, families, and community. In that sense, community-based advocacy efforts were successful at generating an enabling environment for service delivery. The KC3 clients, family members, and community representatives also appreciated efforts from the KC3 team to promote demand reduction through counseling, Narcotics Anonymous (NA) sessions, and privileged access to the Argao Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (TRC). There is great demand and genuine interest among the KC3 clients and patients' clients to become peer educators and provide support to PWID. The professionalization of PWID through peer educator roles has also reportedly reduced stigma and discrimination and increased acceptance of PWID in the community. Should services for PWID be scaled up in Cebu and beyond, recruiting a workforce of peer educators should not be a critical challenge, an important lesson learned for future harm reduction projects in the Philippines",

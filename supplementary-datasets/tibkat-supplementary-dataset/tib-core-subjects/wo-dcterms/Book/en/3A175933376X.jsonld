                "If you are a designer, producer, marketer, or researcher creating products for children, it is essential that you are aware of the key differences between children and adults when it comes to user journeys. While children might speak the same language as adult users, what they are actually communicating can be completely different. User Research with Kids explores these differences and more. Author Thomas Visby Snitker walks you through how to best approach user research with children through the processes of conceptualization, design, prototyping, and eventually the launch. Adults who research kids\u2019 experiences venture into a familiar yet foreign land where the inhabitants speak a different (yet familiar) language and have different behavioral norms and values. It is important for researchers to decipher and understand this language. Including children in the process will lead to better targeted and better designed products, and User Research with Kids will help you attain this goal. Snitker\u2019s useful insights in this book will help professionals and students in all sectors of research, design, and innovation. User Research with Kids will teach you how to better work with children using key approaches, such as understanding what play is and holistically measuring experience from a child\u2019s cognitive perspective. Apply research rigor and best practices for your next product launch, and expand your user understanding with User Research with Kids."

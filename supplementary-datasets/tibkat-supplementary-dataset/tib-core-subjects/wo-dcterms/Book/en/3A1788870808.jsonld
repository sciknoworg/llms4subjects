                "\u2018This collection of essays brings together fresh voices in international criminal law to tackle perhaps the most misunderstood, and potentially the most important, concept in modern international criminal law: complementarity. By addressing the prospects and challenges of national-level prosecution of the most serious crimes in international law, the book opens up avenues for further reflection.\u2019 \u2014 Dire Tladi, Professor and NRF SARChI Chair of International Constitutional Law, South Africa This book critically examines the issues pertaining to the Rome Statute\u2019s complementarity principle. The focus lies on the primacy of African states to prosecute alleged perpetrators of international crimes in their respective jurisdictions. The chapters explore states\u2019 international and domestic obligations to hold perpetrators of international crimes to account before the national courts, and demonstrate the complexity of enforcing national accountability of alleged perpetrators of international crimes while also ensuring that post-conflict African states achieve national healing, reconciliation, and sustainable peace. The contributions reject impunity for international crimes whilst also considering these complexities. Emphasis further lies on the meaning of accountability in the context of the politics of selective international criminal justice for crimes committed before the establishment of the International Criminal Court.

                "This book is the first research collection by the Malaysian Society for Automatic Control Engineers (MACE). Numerous applications of control engineering, sensor, and instrumentation technology in robotics, industrial automation, and other mechatronic systems are presented in this book. The book begins by introducing control engineering in robotics and industrial automation. It progresses through a series of chapters, discussing the application of control engineering in various areas such as: brake-by-wire technology; web scrubber systems; robot localization; and, autonomous navigation systems. Coverage of swarm robotics behaviors and applications of sensor technology in the field of music, biomedical technology, and structural analysis takes the book beyond its core of mechatronic systems and demonstrates a more diverse application of the ideas it presents. Each chapter provides comprehensive and detailed coverage of the main ideas, design methods, and practical needs of its chosen topic, making this book accessible and useful to researchers, engineers, postgraduates, and undergraduate students. .",

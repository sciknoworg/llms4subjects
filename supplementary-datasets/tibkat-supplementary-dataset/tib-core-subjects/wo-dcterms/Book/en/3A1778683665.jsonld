            "title": "New Trends and Developments in Biometrics",
            "abstract": "In recent years, biometrics has developed rapidly with its worldwide applications for daily life. New trends and novel developments have been proposed to acquire and process many different biometric traits. The ignored challenges in the past and potential problems need to be thought together and deeply integrated. The key objective of the book is to keep up with the new technologies on some recent theoretical development as well as new trends of applications in biometrics. The topics covered in this book reflect well both aspects of development. They include the new development in forensic speaker recognition, 3D and thermo face recognition, finger vein recognition, contact-less biometric system, hand geometry recognition, biometric performance evaluation, multi-biometric template protection, and novel subfields in the new challenge fields. The book consists of 13 chapters. It is divided into four sections, namely, theory and method, performance evaluation, security and template protection, and other applications. The book was reviewed by editors Dr. Jucheng Yang and Dr. Shanjuan Xie. We deeply appreciate the efforts of our guest editors: Dr. Norman Poh, Dr. Loris Nanni, Dr. Dongsun Park, Dr. Sook Yoon and Ms. Congcong Xiong, as well as a number of anonymous reviewers",

            "abstract": "Noise has various effects on comfort, performance, and human health. For this reason, noise control plays an increasingly central role in the development of modern industrial and engineering applications. Nowadays, the noise control problem excites and attracts the attention of a great number of scientists in different disciplines. Indeed, noise control has a wide variety of applications in manufacturing, industrial operations, and consumer products. The main purpose of this book, organized in 13 chapters, is to present a comprehensive overview of recent advances in noise control and its applications in different research fields. The authors provide a range of practical applications of current and past noise control strategies in different real engineering problems. It is well addressed to researchers and engineers who have specific knowledge in acoustic problems. I would like to thank all the authors who accepted my invitation and agreed to share their work and experiences",

            "abstract": "\"3D printed electronics have captured much attention in recent years, owing to their success in allowing on-demand fabrication of highly-customisable electronics on a wide variety of substrates and conformal surfaces. This textbook helps readers understand and gain valuable insights into 3D printed electronics. It does not require readers to have any prior knowledge on the subject. 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing of Electronics: Principles and Applications provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress and discusses the fundamentals of the 3D printed electronics technologies, their respective advantages, shortcomings and potential applications. The book covers conventional contact printing techniques for printed electronics, 3D electronics printing techniques, materials and inks inks for 3D-printed electronics, substrates and processing for 3D-printed electronics, sintering techniques for metallic nanoparticle inks, designs and simulations, applications of 3D-printed electronics, and future trends. The book includes several related problems for the reader to test his or her understanding of the topics. This book is a good guide for anyone who is interested in the 3D printing of electronics. The book is also an effective textbook for undergraduate and graduate courses that aim to arm their students with a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of 3D printed electronics\"--",

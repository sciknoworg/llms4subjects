            "abstract": "The article deals with interrelations of voice, body and technology in popular music from a musicological perspective. It is an attempt to outline a systematic approach to the history of music technology with regard to aesthetic aspects, taking the identity of the singing subject as a main point of departure for a hermeneutic reading of popular song. Although the argumentation is based largely on musicological research, it is also inspired by the notion of presentness as developed by theologian and media scholar Walter Ong. The variety of the relationships between voice, body, and technology with regard to musical representations of identity, in particular gender and race, is systematized alongside the following cagories: (1) the \u201cabsence of the body,\u201d that starts with the establishment of phonography; (2) \u201camplified presence,\u201d as a signifier for uses of the microphone to enhance low sounds in certain manners; and (3) \u201chybridity,\u201d including vocal identities that blend human body sounds and technological processing, whereby special focus is laid on uses of the vocoder and similar technologies",

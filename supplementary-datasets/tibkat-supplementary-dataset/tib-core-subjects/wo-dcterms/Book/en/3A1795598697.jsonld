                "This book highlights the contribution of artificial intelligence for mathematics education. It provides concrete ideas supported by mathematical work obtained through dynamic international collaboration, and discusses the flourishing of new mathematics in the contemporary world from a sustainable development perspective. Over the past thirty years, artificial intelligence has gradually infiltrated all facets of society. When it is deployed in interaction with the human designer or user, AI certainly raises new ethical questions. But as soon as it aims to augment intelligence in a kind of human-machine partnership, it goes to the heart of knowledge development and the very performance of work. The proposed themes and the sections of the book address original issues relating to the creation of AI milieus to work on mathematics, to the AI-supported learning of mathematics and to the coordination of \u00ab usual \u00bb paper/pencil techniques and \u00ab new \u00bb AI-aided educational working spaces. The authors of the book and the coordinators of each section are all established specialists in mathematics didactics, mathematics and computer science. In summary, this book is a must-read for everyone interested in the teaching and learning of mathematics, and it concerns the interaction between the human and the machine in both directions. It contains ideas, questions and inspiration that invite to take up the challenge of Artificial Intelligence contributing to Mathematical Human Learning."

            "title": "The Stone Age of Qeqertarsuup Tunua (Disko Bugt) (Vol. 336):A regional analysis of the Saqqaq and Dorset cultures of Central West Greenland",
            "abstract": "The present text is a revised version of the Ph.D. thesis Tent Rings and Stone Tools defended bythe author on March 11th 2005 at the University of Copenhagen.Saqqaq and Dorset sites excavated by the author in the southern part of Qeqertarsuup Tunua (DiskoBugt) form the empirical basis for a comparison of Saqqaq and Dorset settlement in the area. Earlierreconstructions of the cultural history were based mainly on observations of stratified middens. Incontrast to this, the present work focuses on the horizontal dimension within the archaeologicalrecord. As a consequence, settlement patterns, dwelling types and the spatial organisation ofdwellings are the principal objectives.Saqqaq and Dorset settlement patterns are broadly similar and it is concluded that there is littleevidence to suggest any major difference in economy or adaptation between the two periods. BothSaqqaq and Dorset settlement patterns are characterised by a number of large settlements locatedstrategically near the most productive biotopes. Minor settlements, most often occupied during thewarm season, are found within the catchment area, indicating annual recurring dispersal of thepopulation during the warmer months. Only Sydostbugten, in Southeastern Qeqertarsuup Tunua,appears to exhibit significant differences between Saqqaq and Dorset settlement patterns. LargeDorset settlements have not been found in Sydostbugten and it is suggested that this area, probablydue to climatic oscillations, was less attractive for settlement during the Dorset period than it was inthe Saqqaq. Consequently, the Dorset people seem only to have utilised Sydostbugten forspecialised seasonal camps.Saqqaq and Dorset accommodation comprises distinct summer and winter dwellings. During bothperiods, the summer dwellings are characterised by what are believed to be single family tents.These occur in two principal varieties: Tent rings, with a central hearth, and mid-passage tent rings,where the interior is divided in two by parallel lines of stones. This difference in architecture issuggested to result from variation in the social composition of the inhabitants. Winter dwellings ofboth the Saqqaq and Dorset cultures are characterised by more solidly built structures. In theSaqqaq culture there are platform dwellings and mid-passage structures filled with fire-crackedrocks. During the Dorset, the winter dwellings are characterised by double-platform dwellings , inwhich a central floor area divides the interior into two platforms that are often paved. The presenceof more than one hearth or lamp stand, as well as mirrored distributions of the most frequent toolcategories to the left and right of the central floor area, is interpreted as a result of these dwellingsbeing occupied by two families.Chapter 7 focuses on Saqqaq raw material distribution from killiaq sources in the vicinity ofQaarsut and Angissat. The raw material distribution from these two sources is characterised as aregional and local system. The procurement and subsequent distribution of raw materials fromAngissat in Southern Qeqertarsuup Tunua appears thus to have been imbedded in the local resourceexploitation. Much of the raw material extraction appears to have been carried out by huntingparties visiting the outcrop during summer hunting trips. In contrast to this, Qaarsut at Nuussuaqshows evidence of a more comprehensive production of preforms, which were distributed throughoutWestern Greenland.Economically as well as socially, there appear to be numerous similarities between the Saqqaq andDorset cultures. However, when evaluating the radiocarbon dates, there appears to be discontinuitybetween the two periods as is also suggested by earlier excavations of stratified deposits. In SisimiutDistrict, to the south of Qeqertarsuup Tunua, the latest Saqqaq dates overlap with the oldest Dorsetdates. Theoretically, there could be continuity between the two periods outside QeqertarsuupTunua, however the archaeological evidence for such a development has yet to be found.When the cultural history of Qeqertarsuup Tunua is compared with that of Peary Land, the dwellingtypes and chronological units appear very similar. In the case of Dorset and Independence II, thesimilarities also extend to include the lithic inventory. As a consequence it is difficult to maintain adivision between Dorset in Western and Southern Greenland and Independence II in the HighArctic",

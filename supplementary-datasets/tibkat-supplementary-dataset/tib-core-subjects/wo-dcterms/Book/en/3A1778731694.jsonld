            "abstract": "Papua New Guinea has a complex \u2018law and order\u2019 problem and an entrenched epidemic of HIV. This book explores their interaction. It also probes their joint challenges and opportunities\u2014most fundamentally for civic security, a condition that could offersome immunity to both. This book is a valuable and timely contribution to a limited but growing body of scholarship in the social and structural contexts of HIV epidemiology in Papua New Guinea. The volume offers a unique collection of interdisciplinary insights on the connections between law and order and the HIV epidemic and is presented in a manner accessible to a wide audience, scholars and lay people alike\u2026 Significantly, this is the first volume to critically examine the complex and inexorable links between HIV, gender, violence, and security within a theoretical framework thv at illuminates the challenges of the epidemic for PNG\u2019s future cohesion and stability as a young nation\u2026The importance of this courageous book cannot be overstated. While it communicates an urgent and potent message about the need for immediate action \u2026 it offers insightful reflections on the processes and possibilities of social transformation that undoubtedly will have enduring scholarly and practical value.

                "Designing inclusively is no longer an option for companies. It is a business essential. Global populations are getting older, legislation is increasingly prohibitive of unnecessary exclusion and consumer attitudes are beginning to change. Exclusivity is out, inclusivity is in. Research communities the world over are responding to this change in design emphasis. Conferences such as the Cambridge Workshops on Universal Access and Assistive Technology (CWUAAT) offer a forum for researchers from diverse and varied disciplines to bring their perspectives on inclusive design together. This book has been inspired by the second CWUAAT, held in Cambridge, England in March 2004. It contains chapters from an international group of leading researchers in this field. Contributions focus on the following topics: design issues for universal access and assistive technology; enabling computer access and new technologies; and, assistive technology and rehabilitation robotics. This series of conferences is aimed at a broad range of interests, with a general focus on the development of products and solutions. Numerous case studies are used to raise awareness of the challenges faced in developing truly inclusive products, along with examples of good practice for design for a more inclusive world."

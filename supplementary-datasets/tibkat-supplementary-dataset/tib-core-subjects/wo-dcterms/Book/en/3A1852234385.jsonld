            "abstract": "This book offers the latest research results in security and privacy for Intelligent Edge Computing Systems. It presents state-of-the art content and provides an in-depth overview of the basic background in this related field. Practical areas in both security and risk analysis are addressed as well as connections directly linked to Edge Computing paradigms. This book also offers an excellent foundation on the fundamental concepts and principles of security, privacy and risk analysis in Edge Computation infrastructures. It guides the reader through the core ideas with relevant ease.  Edge Computing has burst onto the computational scene offering key technologies for allowing more flexibility at the edge of networks. As Edge Computing has evolved as well as the need for more in-depth solutions in security, privacy and risk analysis at the edge. This book includes various case studies and applications on Edge Computing. It includes the Internet of Things related areas, such as smart cities, blockchain, mobile networks, federated learning, cryptography and cybersecurity.  This book is one of the first reference books covering security and risk analysis in Edge Computing Systems. Researchers and advanced-level students studying or working in Edge Computing and related security fields will find this book useful as a reference. Decision makers, managers and professionals working within these fields will want to purchase this book as well",

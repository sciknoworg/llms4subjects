            "abstract": "In the last few decades civil engineering has undergone substantial technological change which has, naturally, been reflected in the terminology employed in the industry. Efforts are now being made in many countries to bring about a systematization and unification of technical terminology in general, and that of civil engineering in particular. The publication of a multilingual dictionary of civil engineering terms has been necessitat\u00aded by the expansion of international cooperation and information exchange in this field, as well as by the lack of suitable updated bilingual dictionaries. This Dictionary contains some 14.000 English terms together with their German, French, Dutch and Russian equivalents, which are used in the main branches of civil engineering and relate to the basic principles of structural design and calculations (the elasticity theory, strength of materials, soil mechanics and other allied technical disciplines); to buildings and installations, structures and their parts, building materials and prefabrications, civil engineering technology and practice, building and road construction machines, construction site equipment, housing equipment and fittings (including modern systems of air conditioning); as well as to hydrotechni\u00adcal and irrigation constructions. The Dictionary also includes a limited number of basic technical expressions and terms relating to allied disciplines such as architecture and town planning, as well as airfield, railway and underground construction. The Dictionary does not list trade names of building materials, parts and machines or the names of chemical compounds. Nor does it give adverbial, adjective or verbal terms.",

            "abstract": "Well into the twenty-first century, achieving gender equality in the economy remains unfinished business. Worldwide, women\u2019s employment, income, and leadership opportunities lag men\u2019s. Building and using a one-of-a-kind database that covers 193 countries, this book systematically analyzes how far we\u2019ve come and how far we have to go in adopting evidence-based solutions to close the gaps. Spanning topics including girls\u2019 education, employment discrimination of all kinds, sexual harassment, and caregiving needs across the life course, the authors bring the findings to life through global maps, stories of laws\u2019 impact in courts and beyond, and case studies of making change. A powerful call to action, Equality within Our Lifetimes reveals how gender equality is both feasible and urgently needed to address some of the greatest challenges of our generation. \u201cAn inspirational title to further the advancement of comprehensive gender equality, which goes beyond formal and protective equality to substantive equality that underpins transformative laws, policies, and, above all, results on the ground.\u201d \u2014 VIRGINIA BRAS GOMES, Former Chairperson of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \u201cThis book makes a compelling case, based on both quantitative and qualitative data, for how and why gender equality benefits everyone. Governments would be wise to heed this lesson.\u201d \u2014 YASMEEN HASSAN, Global Executive Director, Equality Now \u201cThis book is an essential handbook for those invested in gender equality law and policy.\u201d \u2014 CATHERINE FISK, Barbara Nachtrieb Armstrong Professor of Law, University of California, Berkeley School of Law",

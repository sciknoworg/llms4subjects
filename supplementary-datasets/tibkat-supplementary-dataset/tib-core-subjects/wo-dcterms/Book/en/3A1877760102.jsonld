With its diverse conceptual scope, commitment to cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural research, this edited collection works to broaden the conception of \u2018consent\u2019 as an evolving entity in both theory and practice by foreground disciplinary diversity. The chapters are grouped into five sections: \u2018Culture and Resistance\u2019; \u2018Consent on Screen\u2019; \u2018Coercion and Violence\u2019; \u2018Practice and Pedagogies\u2019; and \u2018Futures of Consent\u2019, each presenting plural articulations of consent as it circulates across contemporary life, from media and cultural production to technology and pedagogy. Consent: Legacies, Representation, and Frameworks for the Future is of value to undergraduate and graduate students studying gender studies, sociology, media studies and law",

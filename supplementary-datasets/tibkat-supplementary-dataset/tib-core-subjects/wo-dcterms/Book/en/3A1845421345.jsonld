            "abstract": "This text offers comprehensive coverage of a wide range of concepts related to articulation and phonology. The text\u2019s strong, clinical emphasis along with the variety of helpful learning aids makes this text ideal for understanding critical topics.  In this comprehensive fourth edition of Articulatory and Phonological Impairments: A Clinical Focus, a range of topics are covered including, an overview of phonetic transcription and diacritics used to document disordered speech, several theoretical models, including newer nonlinear frameworks, phonological development, and relevant diagnostic and therapeutic suggestions for special populations discussed in detail. Additionally, the application of theoretical principles to practical examples creates a bridge for students between conceptual learning and the understanding of principles based on their application. These topics, coupled with the learning aids throughout the text, strengthen the conceptual framework and through application, demonstrate that the student has understood specific principles. A large portion of the text is devoted to specific assessment and treatment details of articulatory and phonological disorders including a section on childhood apraxia of speech, cerebral palsy, cleft lip and palate, mental disability, hearing impairments, acquired dysarthrias, and apraxia of speech.  These topics are encompassed in a clinical framework which continues to provide practical examples and the application of principles to real-life situations",

This use of critical thinking will minimize the likelihood of mistakes that can result in the wasting of finite resources and the possible loss of life. Included in this book are examples, both successful and unsuccessful, for each of the functions on which industrial engineers focus. These examples include the critical questions that were asked that resulted in success and those questions that were not asked that resulted in failure. Integration of Methods Improvement and Measurement into Industrial Engineering Functions is applicable to students, new graduates, and practitioners in the areas of industrial engineering, human factors, materials processing, quality control, asset management, production control, and supply chain management, as well as those concerned with safety issues\"--",

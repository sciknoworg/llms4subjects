                "This book presents synthesis techniques for the preparation of low-dimensional nanomaterials including 0D (quantum dots), 1D (nanowires, nanotubes) and 2D (thin films, few layers), as well as their potential applications in nanoelectronic systems. It focuses on the size effects involved in the transition from bulk materials to nanomaterials; the electronic properties of nanoscale devices; and different classes of nanomaterials from microelectronics to nanoelectronics, to molecular electronics. Furthermore, it demonstrates the structural stability, physical, chemical, magnetic, optical, electrical, thermal, electronic and mechanical properties of the nanomaterials. Subsequent chapters address their characterization, fabrication techniques from lab-scale to mass production, and functionality. In turn, the book considers the environmental impact of nanotechnology and novel applications in the mechanical industries, energy harvesting, clean energy, manufacturing materials, electronics, transistors, health and medical therapy. In closing, it addresses the combination of biological systems with nanoelectronics and highlights examples of nanoelectronic\u2013cell interfaces and other advanced medical applications. The book answers the following questions: \u2022 What is different at the nanoscale? \u2022 What is new about nanoscience? \u2022 What are nanomaterials (NMs)? \u2022 What are the fundamental issues in nanomaterials? \u2022 Where are nanomaterials found? \u2022 What nanomaterials exist in nature? \u2022 What is the importance of NMs in our lives? \u2022 Why so much interest in nanomaterials? \u2022 What is at nanoscale in nanomaterials? \u2022 What is graphene? \u2022 Are pure low-dimensional systems interesting and worth pursuing? \u2022 Are nanotechnology products currently available? \u2022 What are sensors? \u2022 How can Artificial Intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology work together? \u2022 What are the recent advances in nanoelectronic materials? \u2022 What are the latest applications of NMs?",

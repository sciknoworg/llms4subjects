            "abstract": "In Adulterous Nations, Tatiana Kuzmic enlarges our perspective on the nineteenth-century novel of adultery and how it often served as a metaphor for relationships between the imperial and the colonized. In the context of the long-standing practice of gendering nations as female, the novels discussed\u2014Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch, Fontane\u2019s Effi Briest, and Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina, along with \u0160enoa\u2019s The Goldsmith\u2019s Gold and Sienkiewicz\u2019s Quo Vadis\u2014can be understood as depicting international crises on the scale of the nuclear family. Kuzmic argues that the hopes, anxieties, and interests of European nations in this period can be discerned in the destabilizing force of adultery. Reading the work of \u0160enoa and Sienkiewicz, Kuzmic illuminates the relationship between the literature of dominant nations and that of the semicolonized territories that posed a threat to them. Kuzmic\u2019s study enhances our understanding of not only these novels but nineteenth-century European literature more generally",

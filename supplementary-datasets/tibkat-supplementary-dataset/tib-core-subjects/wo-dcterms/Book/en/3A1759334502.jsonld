            "abstract": "This book is an open invitation to the enterprise of re-imagining an alternative decolonial development project in Africa. It does this by focusing on the triple themes of African agency, development finance, and African developmental states in the context of an emerging multipolar world system. The book must be read as an affirmatively disruptive inquiry into the twin evils of global coloniality and global capitalist economic relations that have kept Africa on the lower rungs of the global pecking order, thereby preventing the rooting of an alternative development paradigm on the continent. As such, the book seeks to contribute towards the project of extricating the financing of development in Africa from the clutches of the Global North and the emerging powers of the Global South. In this way, it is a call for Afro-rebellion against the old and new forms of global coloniality and global capitalism. While the book is of major interest to scholars and students of African Studies, Development Studies, International Development Cooperation, International Relations, International Trade and Investment, Diplomacy, Africa\u2013China Relations, and Political Science, it is equally meant for the general reader as it assumes no prior knowledge in any of the field of enquiry other than interest in the development of the African continent.

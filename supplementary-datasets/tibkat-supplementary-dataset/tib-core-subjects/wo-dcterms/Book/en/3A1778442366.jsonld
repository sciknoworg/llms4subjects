            "abstract": "Biophysical chemistry is one of the most interesting interdisciplinary research fields. Some of its different subjects have been intensively studied for decades. Now the field attracts not only scientists from chemistry, physics, and biology backgrounds but also those from medicine, pharmacy, and other sciences. We aimed to start this version of the book Biophysical Chemistry from advanced principles, as we include some of the most advanced subject matter, such as advanced topics in catalysis applications (first section) and therapeutic applications (second section). This led us to limit our selection to only chapters with high standards, therefore there are only six chapters, divided into two sections. We have assumed that the interested readers are familiar with the fundamentals of some advanced topics in mathematics such as integration, differentiation, and calculus and have some knowledge of organic and physical chemistry, biology, and pharmacy. We hope that the book will be valuable to graduate and postdoctoral students with the requisite background, and by some advanced researchers active in chemistry, biology, biochemistry, medicine, pharmacy, and other sciences",

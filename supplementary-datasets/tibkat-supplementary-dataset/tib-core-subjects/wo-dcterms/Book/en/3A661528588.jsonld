                "Origins and consequences of child-labor restrictions : a macroeconomic perspective / Matthias Doepke, Dirk Krueger -- Changes in the distribution of family hours worked since 1950 / Ellen R. McGrattan, Richard Rogerson -- The labor market and female crime / Bryan Engelhardt, Guillaume Rocheteau, Peter Rupert -- An economic history of fertility in the United States : 1826-1960 / Larry E. Jones, Mich(c)\u00d8ele Tertilt -- Families and careers / Gueorgui Kambourov, Iourii Manovskii, Irina A. Telyukova -- Filling the poverty gap, then and now / James P. Ziliak. - Over the past several decades there have been substantial changes in the size, composition, educational level, work activity, and locational choice of families. The aim of this book series is to provide a better understanding of the forces that have led to the choices and consequent observed changes. The aforementioned changes have likely resulted from varied sources. The initial book will provide a collection of articles at the frontier of research on issues relevant to family decision making and the outcomes of such decisions. The book will contain theoretical as well as empirical insights. Future volumes will focus more narrowly on particular topics.The term family economics is, admittedly, quite broad; however, it was chosen precisely for that feature. The topics to be covered are vast, yet likely interrelated: What explains the rise in labor force participation of women over the past fifty years? What role does technological advance in the household sector play in understanding the behavior of labor force participation and hours of work at home and in the market? What explains the increase in occupational mobility over the past several decades? What factors might be important in explaining the increased rate of divorce? What effect does the increased divorce rate have on the outcomes of children? How much does schooling choice matter for child outcomes?What are the factors that lead to migration/immigration? What explains the explosion in personal bankruptcy rates observed over the past two decades? These are examples of questions that are currently being asked by researchers throughout the world. Moreover, the answers to such questions can help guide policy makers in understanding how their decisions affect the choices made by individuals and families. The book series will provide readers with a solid theoretical framework as well as a thorough description of the relevant data",

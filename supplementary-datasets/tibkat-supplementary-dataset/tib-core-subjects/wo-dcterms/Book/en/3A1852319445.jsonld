            "abstract": "This advisory services and analytics (ASA) study focuses on the empowerment of South Sudanese girls and women. The report provides a cohesive overview of the barriers to empowering girls and women in South Sudan, as well as evidence-based programs and strategies that have been successful in the country and other similar fragile contexts. Focusing on both global and country-specific evidence, which has been informed by a desk review, the report also focuses on successful strategies and programs to understand what is being done and what works worldwide for women and girls. This ASA builds on several programs currently in place for South Sudan, providing synergies across various sectors. The findings from this ASA will be particularly impactful for an emerging operation in South Sudan that focuses on the empowerment of women. Specifically, this ASA will create synergies with the South Sudan Women's Social and Economic Empowerment Project, given that its target population is also girls and women. This report will attend to strategies to empower women from the social and economic perspective and its support to the institutional environment to facilitate this. Further, the South Sudan Women's Social and Economic Empowerment Project may benefit from the findings and recommendations from this ASA, especially from an economic perspective, as it embarks on implementation and seeks to empower women in South Sudan",

            "abstract": "Research efforts in the past ten years have led to considerable advances in the concepts and methods of smart manufacturing. Smart Manufacturing: Concepts and Methods puts these advances in perspective, showing how process industries can benefit from these new techniques. The book consolidates results developed by leading academic and industrial groups in the area, providing a systematic, comprehensive coverage of conceptual and methodological advances made to date. Written by leaders in the field from around the world, Smart Manufacturing: Concepts and Methods is essential reading for graduate students, researchers, process engineers, and managers. It is complemented by Smart Manufacturing: Applications and Case Studies, which covers the applications of smart manufacturing concepts and methods in process industries and beyond.- Takes a process-systems engineering approach to design, monitoring, and control of smart manufacturing systems - Brings together the key concepts and methods of smart manufacturing, including the advances made in the past decade - Includes coverage of computation methods for process optimization, control, and safety, as well as advanced modelling techniques",

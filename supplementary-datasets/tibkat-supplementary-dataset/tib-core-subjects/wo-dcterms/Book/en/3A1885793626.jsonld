With respect to historical terminologies, however, research has been dominated by linguistic approaches. Breaking new ground, Coming to Terms collects eleven articles that combine an interest in the history of knowledge, mostly ancient Greek, with research on scientific terminologies. They all share an interest in terminological practices, that is, questions such as how and when to coin a term and then what to do with it. Among the fields discussed are astronomy, the Roman surveyors, Aristotelian science, Renaissance and modern biology, contemporary medicine, ancient Chinese philosophy, 20th-century physics, and colonial linguistics. Confronting ancient with modern terminologies, the collection intends to test integrative interpretive approaches. Thus, the collection documents how rich ancient (and modern) terminologies are and shows that they are, beyond lexicography, worth being studied per se. ; Terminologies present various challenges to their inventors and to their users, ranging from epistemic adequacy over linguistic concerns to matters of strategy and group construction.

            "abstract": "Mid-century modern continues its resurgence. Discover Australia's best examples of modernist residential architecture thoughtfully adapted for the present day. The intuitive design, sun-lit spaces and tranquil vibe of Modernist houses still have an enduring appeal today. But can these homes be updated for contemporary living while maintaining the integrity of the original architecture? The New Modernist House presents twenty-one mid-century homes respectfully restored and renewed for future generations to enjoy. Designs by some of the period's heavyweights - including Anatol Kagan, Alistair Knox and Ernest Fooks - have been sensitively updated by today's creative innovators. Alongside stories of the passionate homeowners, architects and collaborators who have given these homes new life, a historical overview and section on practical considerations inform those drawn to a Modernist dream house. This colourful volume is both a useful resource for those embarking on their own renovation journey, and a sourcebook of inspiration for delighting in moments of nostalgia",

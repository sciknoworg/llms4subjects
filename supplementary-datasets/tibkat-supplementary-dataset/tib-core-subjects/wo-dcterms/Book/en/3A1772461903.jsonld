                "\"Writing this book has posed a number of challenges. One is that racism is ongoing; while we were writing this book, many examples of extreme racism were occurring on a nearly daily basis-killings of unarmed Black men and women by the police with minimal accountability; a president who, along with his cabinet, worked to push draconian policies and a racist agenda; and the forced caging of immigrant children along with the deportation of their parents. Another challenge is that there are many levels of racism. We could not concentrate only on racist stereotypes, or institutional racism, or interpersonal and intergroup racism. Knowledge of all forms of racism is relevant to helping professionals, as is knowing how to address them. Therefore, we had to place racism in a historical context and link it to other related forms of oppression, such as classism, sexism, and heterosexism. Thus, this book approaches racism comprehensively, with an emphasis on how helping professionals can respond\"--",

            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Since its inception in the early 1980s, capillary electrophoresis (CE) offers a great deal of flexibility as a modern analytical technique, and has found applications within many fields of analysis, particularly pharmaceutical science and biochemistry. Until now, food analysts have had difficulties in adopting the technique due to the lack of written guidance. Capillary Electrophoresis for Food Analysis: Method Development provides basic information and the support needed to enable food analysts to utilise the technique for the development of new separation methods. Designed specifically for the needs of food analysts, the book takes the reader step by step through the process of developing and troubleshooting CE methods. Worked examples are included to make it ideal as a laboratory companion as well as a library reference source",

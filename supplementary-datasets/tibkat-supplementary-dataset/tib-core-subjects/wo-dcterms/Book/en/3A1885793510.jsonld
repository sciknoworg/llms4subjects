The KKR Aceh was                    founded in late 2016, as a product of the 2005 peace deal between the Indonesian                    government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM). It has since faced many                    challenges\u2014not least from Indonesia\u2019s security forces and former GAM leaders,                    who have joined together in their determination to maintain impunity for their                    respective roles in the conflict. Indeed, the commission would not have been                    established without the tireless work of civil society actors, including                    non-government organisations and other humanitarian groups. In Resisting                    Indonesia\u2019s Culture of Impunity, the editors set out to amplify the role of                    these civil society actors in the KKR Aceh and in transitional justice in                    Indonesia. Each chapter has been written by a team of authors, composed                    predominantly of commissioners and staff from the KKR Aceh itself, members of                    key civil society organisations, and academics. Further, the editors aim to                    scrutinise the KKR Aceh from the inside and analyse the establishment and                    operation of what is perhaps the only genuine state-sponsored attempt to                    implement transitional justice in Indonesia today",

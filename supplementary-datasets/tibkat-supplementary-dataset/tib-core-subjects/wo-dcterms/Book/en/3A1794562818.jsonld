            "abstract": "Childhood obesity continues to be a global problem, with several regions showing increasing rates and others having one in every three children overweight despite an apparent halt or downward trend. Children are exposed to nutritional, social, and obesogenic environmental risks from different settings, and this affects their lifelong health. There is a consensus that high-quality multifaceted smart and cost-effective interventions enable children to grow with a healthy set of habits that have lifelong benefits to their wellbeing. The literature has shown that dietary approaches play key roles in improving children\u2019s health, not only on a nutritional level but also in diet quality and patterns. An association between the nutritional strategy and other lifestyle components promotes a more comprehensive approach and should be envisioned in intervention studies. This Special Issue entitled \u201cChild Obesity and Nutrition Promotion Intervention\u201d combines original research manuscripts or reviews of the scientific literature concerning classic or innovative approaches to tackle this public health issue. It presents several nutritional interventions alongside lifestyle health factors, and outcome indicators of effectiveness and sustainability from traditional to ground-breaking methods to exploit both qualitative and quantitative approaches in tackling child obesity",

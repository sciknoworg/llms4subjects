            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, In the last few years there have been many exciting and innovative developments in the field of membrane protein structure and this trend is set to continue. Structural Biology of Membrane Proteins is a new monograph covering a wide range of topics with contributions from leading experts in the field. The book is split into three sections: the first discusses topics such as expression, purification and crystallisation; the second covers characterisation techniques and the final section looks at new protein structures. The book will hence have wide appeal to researchers working in and around the field and provide an up-to-date reference source. Introductory sections to each topic are accompanied by more detailed discussions for the more experienced biochemist. Detailed descriptions of experimental methods are included to demonstrate practical approaches to membrane protein structure projects. The book also offers an up-to-date reference source in addition to descriptions of new and emerging developments, including state-of-the-art techniques for solving membrane protein structures.  Structural Biology of Membrane Proteins encompasses both basic introductions and detailed descriptions of themes and should appeal to a wide range of biochemical scientists, both experienced and beginner",

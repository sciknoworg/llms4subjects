                "'Research Handbook on Women in International Management is a welcome addition to the literature on international management, and a must-read for any scholar, from any country, seeking to develop theory and/or research in this field. The book is remarkable for its diversity, covering past, present and future, every region of the world, and many different types of international experience, and family circumstance. Thorough and thought-provoking.' --Kerr Inkson, The University of Auckland Business School, New Zealand and co-author, with Yvonne McNulty, of Managing Expatriates: A Return on Investment Approach. 'This book provides a competent coverage of the key issues confronting women in international management. It offers a balanced view of the challenges women in many parts of the world face and the reasons why such challenges exist. It is timely and valuable contribution to the current debates in the international HRM literature.' --Dana Minbaeva, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark. The Research Handbook on Women in International Management is a carefully designed collection of contributions that provides a thorough and nuanced discussion of how women engage in international management. It also offers important insights into emerging and new areas of research warranting future consideration. The Handbook commences by reviewing the history of the literature, from the development of the discipline through the current state of research, and progresses into examinations of how socio-cultural and organizational issues affect women, with reference to work/life issues and family. Matters affecting women in international management and work in diverse areas of the globe are then examined, including the Arab Middle East, East Asia, South America, and Western and Central Europe. Next, themes including self-initiated expatriation, women in non-traditional families, and women in the mining industry are explored. The Handbook concludes with a few explicitly reflective chapters by academics working within the field"

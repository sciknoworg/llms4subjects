            "abstract": "\"In the rapidly advancing modern world, scientific and technological understanding and innovation are reaching new heights. Computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer have emerged as powerful tools, playing a pivotal role in the analysis and design of complex engineering problems and processes. With the ability to mathematically model various engineering phenomena, these computational tools offer a deeper understanding of intricate dynamics before the physical prototype is created. Widely employed as simulation tools, computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer codes enable the virtual or digital prototype development of products and devices involving complex transport and multiphasic phenomena. They have become an indispensable element of the agile product development environment across diverse sectors of manufacturing, facilitating accelerated product development cycles. \"Modeling and Simulation of Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer\" delves into the fascinating world of fluid dynamics and heat transfer modeling, presenting an extensive exploration of these subjects. The book is a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and students seeking to comprehend and apply numerical methods and computational tools in fluid dynamics and heat transfer problems. Esteemed as a leading publication in the fields of heat transfer and computational fluid dynamics, it serves as a platform for exchanging fundamental ideas among researchers worldwide. The book is meticulously crafted to introduce scientists, engineers, educators, research scientists, and both undergraduate and graduate students to computational and analytical techniques for fluid flow and heat transfer. Emphasizing the latest experimental and analytical original research in heat transfer and fluid dynamics, the book showcases a detailed coverage of problems such as one-dimensional, two-dimensional, steady-state, and transient conduction and convection. Furthermore, it presents the author's significant contributions to the development of mathematical models and the application of mathematical methods for analyzing nonlinear dynamic processes. Key Features of the Book: Covers the analysis of advanced thermal engineering systems. Explores the simulation of various fluids with slip effect. Applies entropy and optimization techniques to thermal engineering systems. Discusses heat and mass transfer phenomena. Explores fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media. Captures recent developments in analytical and computational methods used to investigate complex mathematical models of fluid dynamics. Covers the application of mathematical and computational modeling techniques to fluid flow problems in various geometries\"--",

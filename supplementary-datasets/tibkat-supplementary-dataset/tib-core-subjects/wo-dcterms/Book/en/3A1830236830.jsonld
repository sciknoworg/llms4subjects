                "This book provides a developing country perspective on the internationalization of science and the role of science, technology and innovation diplomacy (STID) in leveraging scientific cooperation for sustainable development. Through more than 20 articles contributed by individuals from government departments and academic and research institutions in nine developing countries, it provides a conceptual understanding of the subject and reveals the prevailing perceptions on its practices. The book highlights the significance of international cooperation at bilateral, regional and multilateral levels as well as the challenges in developing North-South Cooperation and the need for strengthening STID in foreign policy and strategies of governments. The book is a useful reference for scientists, technologists, researchers, diplomats, government officials, policy makers and other stakeholders who are engaged directly or indirectly in STID and associated activities."

                "This book establishes a nexus between corruption in public procurement and the prevailing crisis of governance in Africa. The African continent is characterised by the growing concern for the deteriorating human security. In the midst of these woes, African political leaders are known for their stupendous wealth and riches through expropriation of national resources for personal benefits. This growing inequality in the continent has become a major driver for a series of violent and criminal activities, which have added to the worsening governance crisis. Thus, the abuse of public power for advancing private gain constitutes an impediment to effective public service delivery, thereby engendering a crisis of governance. The consequence of this is not limited to the socio-economic growth and welfare of citizens, but it often also jeopardizes the democratic credentials and objectives of the state. Nirmala Dorasamy is Professor in the Department of Public Management and Economics at the Durban University of Technology (DUT), Durban, South Africa. She is an award-winning researcher at the university. Her research focuses on ethics and public sector management, with an emphasis on enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of public service delivery. She has established international linkages in collaborative research with Swinburne University of Technology, Federation University, and Monash University, Australia, the American University in Cairo, MUST University, Kenya, and Mendel University, Czech Republic. Omololu Fagbadebo is Research Fellow at the Durban University of Technology, South Africa. He previously taught Political Science at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria, and University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. He was Press Secretary to the Speaker, Osun State House of Assembly, Nigeria, 1999-2003. He participated in the Study of the United States Institutes (SUSI) on American Politics and Political Thought Fellowship at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2010. His research focuses on comparative politics, legislative studies, public governance, development studies, public institutions, and African government and politics."

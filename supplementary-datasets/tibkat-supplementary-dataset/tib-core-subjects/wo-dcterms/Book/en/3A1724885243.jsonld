            "abstract": "This toolkit is the first of its kind to provide information on promoting and protecting the nutritional status of mothers and children in crises and emergencies. Latin America and the Caribbean is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to major crises and emergencies. This toolkit aims to improve the resilience of the most vulnerable in times of intensified nutritional needs, most notably pregnant and lactating mothers as well as children less than two years of age. Its principal objective is to offer countries, when faced with the transition from stable times into and out of crisis, clear guidance on how to safeguard the nutritional status of mothers and children during times of stability, crisis, and emergency. The principal objective of this toolkit is to offer clear guidance, in a single-source compilation, that will assist countries in safeguarding the nutritional status of mothers and children during times of stability, crisis, and emergency. It aims to inform changes in countries' policies and practices and to guide their attempts to deal with persistently high prevalence rates of malnutrition among their poorest, least educated, and indigenous populations. This toolkit has been crafted so that it can be readily used by non-nutrition specialists",

            "abstract": "Indonesia has been an independent nation for only 70 years, yet it has already reached middle-income status and aims to reach high-income status by 2045. While high levels of economic growth have facilitated impressive development, key gaps have emerged in human capital. To address these gaps, the government is shifting its efforts toward developing and harnessing the level of human capital and skills Indonesians will need to become more competitive in a fast-changing world. To help the GoI tackle its current skills challenges, the World Bank carried out a comprehensive diagnostic of the country's workforce-development system. The GoI is currently preparing a technical and vocational education and training (TVET) long-term strategy and, through BAPPENAS, had requested that the World Bank carry out an assessment of the current state of the Indonesian system to inform this strategy. The diagnostic uses the System Assessment for Better Education Results (SABER) tool developed by the World Bank, which focuses on the areas of governance, financing, information, quality assurance, access, and relevance to business. Implemented in more than 30 countries, the SABER-Workforce Development (SABER-WfD) gauge brings international standards to inform Indonesia's current practices and catalyze policy discussions on how to improve its WfD system. The results summarized below provide a baseline for understanding the current status of the WfD system in Indonesia, as well as a basis for discussing how best to strengthen it for the coming years. The assessment covers the state of the Indonesian system up to September 2019, and it highlights the recent reforms that may indicate developments. Because data collection was carried out in 2019, any developments post-COVID-19 are not included in the assessment",

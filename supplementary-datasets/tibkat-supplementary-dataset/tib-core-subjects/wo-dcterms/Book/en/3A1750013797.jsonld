                "\u201cThis is an exemplary political economy analysis of what has happened across Africa since the contemporary global land grabbing occurred more than a decade ago. While the topic and questions addressed may sound familiar to many readers who have been tracking the issue over the last decade, this volume provides a much needed up to date information, critical insights and nuanced analysis, which place it among the best in Africa\u2019s land rush scholarship and beyond.\u201d \u2014 Tsegaye Moreda, International Institute of Social Studies (ISS), Erasmus University Rotterdam \u201cWhile the stories have faded from the headlines in the decade or so since the trend first emerged, discussions about the implications of large-scale land investments have persisted among academics and development practitioners. This volume manages to both highlight emerging trends and provide an analysis that is rich in contextual detail, while making. an important and timely contribution to discourses on the nexus between law, power and economic development in Africa.\u201d \u2014David Deng, Human Rights Lawyer and Researcher, Detcro LLC This volume provides up-to-date information on what has happened in the African \u2018land rush\u2019, providing national case studies for countries that were heavily impacted. The research will be a critical resource for students, researchers, advocates and policy makers as it provides detailed, long-term assessments of a broad range of national contexts. In addition to the specific questions of land and investment, this book sheds light on the broader international political economy of development in different African countries.

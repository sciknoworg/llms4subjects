            "abstract": "\"The rapid growth of technological developments on the Internet has led many companies to adapt their business to the digital ecosystem and implement new methods and techniques not only to improve the users' experience but also to improve their analytical strategies. What is more, due to the accelerated interconnected world, the amount of information shared on the Internet has widely increased, hence, this allows companies to gather useful data so they can obtain a competitive advantage from it. Therefore, this data utilization has changed the way customers buy and interact with enterprises, obtaining a powerful and personalized user experience along their customer journey. Moreover, in the past few years, the digital ecosystem has been chosen as the main channel used by consumers for the purchase of goods and services. As a result, digital marketing and online advertising have become one of the main strategies used by companies to get to know the results they obtain with their marketing actions. Accordingly, Big Data Marketing has arrived as a novel digital marketing tool applied to emerging technologies on the Internet. Big Data Marketing utilizes large amounts of data to show the proper online audience the right adverts in the accurate moment at any time the audience is using their device. Therefore, advertising can be designed and shown considering users' interests based on what they visit or where they go to. That implies that the user experience is improved as long as they receive personalized adverts focused on what they were curious or concerned about. Besides, companies launch adverts based on Big Data Marketing depending on the interests and offers of each user. Thus, techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Mining, or Business Intelligence have allowed companies to act accordingly in real-time without the user perception. To sum up, the aim is to identify how Big Data Marketing can improve user experience and digital marketing strategies\"--",

                "\u201cAcross thirty three dazzling chapters, this groundbreaking collection from some of the world\u2019s leading migration scholars makes a major contribution to the field of migration studies. Centring south-south migration raises vital theoretical, methodological, and empirical questions for research on mobility globally which go far beyond geographical movements within the symbolic geography of the \u2018Global South\u2019. Situated at the cutting edge of these debates, the contributors to this volume offer food for thought for scholars and students from a range of disciplines and locations.\u201d --Lucy Mayblin, Senior Lecturer, Department of Sociological Studies University of Sheffield. Author of Asylum After Empire: Postcolonial Legacies in the Politics of Asylum Seeking (2017) and Migration Studies and Colonialism (with Joe Turner, 2020) This open access handbook examines the phenomenon of South-South migration and its relationship to inequality in the Global South, where at least a third of all international migration takes place. Drawing on contributions from nearly 70 leading migration scholars, mainly from the Global South, the handbook challenges dominant conceptualisations of migration, offering new perspectives and insights that can inform theoretical and policy understandings and unlock migration\u2019s development potential. The handbook is divided into four parts, each highlighting often overlooked mobility patterns within and between regions of the Global South, as well as the inequalities faced by those who move. Key cross-cutting themes include gender, race, poverty and income inequality, migration decision making, intermediaries, remittances, technology, climate change, food security and migration governance. The handbook is an indispensable resource on South-South migration and inequality for academics, researchers, postgraduates and development practitioners.

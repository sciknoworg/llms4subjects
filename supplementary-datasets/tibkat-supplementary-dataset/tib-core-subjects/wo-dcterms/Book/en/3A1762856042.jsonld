            "abstract": "Establishing a student-centered classroom environment where learning puts students\u2019 interests first is essential for middle school students to learn and thrive. Student success does not simply rely on instruction; it relies on external factors such as school and classroom climate, positive relationships with their teachers and other adults, and a strong sense of belonging with their peers. The young adolescent learner is at a turning point where the need for love, belonging, and acceptance is heightened. Research studies indicate that large percentages of students lack social-emotional competence and believe their teachers do not care about them. Social-emotional learning skills are vital for young adolescents, as are 21st century skills and competencies to prepare them for an information- and technology-driven world.Aligning Social-Emotional and 21st Century Learning in the Classroom: Emerging Research and Opportunities shows teachers practical ways to combine the skills that young adolescents need (social-emotional) and the 21st century skills that they learn to create a culture of success in their middle school classrooms. This book also provides examples of education technologies that teachers can use to promote 21st century learning in their classroom. Highlighting a wide range of topics such as communication skills, critical thinking, social media, and emotional intelligence, this book is crucial for teachers, school administrators, instructional designers, K-12 educators, curriculum developers, academicians, researchers, and students",

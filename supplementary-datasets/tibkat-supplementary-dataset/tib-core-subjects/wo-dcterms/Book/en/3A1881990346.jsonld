            "abstract": "\"This book is an essential guide to IPv6 network slicing. It covers both the fundamentals and cutting-edge technologies of IPv6 network slicing, and provides insights into future industry developments. IP network slicing is an architectural innovation that provides multiple dedicated logical networks on a shared physical network. It comprises a complete set of solutions designed to meet the differentiated service requirements of the 5G and cloud era. This book focuses on IP network slicing based on the data plane of IPv6, a second-generation network layer protocol standard designed to address many of the problems encountered with IPv4. The book explores the technical implementation of IPv6 network slicing by introducing its architecture, implementation solutions, resource partitioning technologies, data plane technologies, and control plane technologies. It also explains how to deploy IPv6 network slicing through slice controllers and provides deployment suggestions based on Huawei practices. It is a must-read for professional engineers involved in network planning, design, and technology support. Researchers and students in information and communication technology and communication system design will also find it useful\"",

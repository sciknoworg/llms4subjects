                "\u201cThis volume casts new light on an age-old issue--the role of religion in forced migration. With chapters by both academics and practitioners, it contributes immensely to our knowledge of forced migration and religion.\u201d \u2014Susan Martin, Donald G. Herzberg Professor Emerita of International Migration, Georgetown University \u201cA welcome addition to the expanding literature on religion and forced migration. It both expands the theoretical framing of how we think about the religion and forced migration nexus and enriches the available case studies. By combining perspectives from both advocates and scholars, this book breaks down the false dichotomy between them.\u201d \u2014Dianna Shandy, Professor of Anthropology, Macalester College and Scholar-in-Residence, Elon University This open access book brings into dialogue migration and religion scholars with spiritual leaders and representatives of faith-based organizations assisting refugees. Migration has always been part of spiritual development. The current 'refugee crisis' has brought to the fore debates regarding the role of religion in defining difference, linking the \u2018refugee crisis\u2019 with Islam, and fear of the \u2018Other.\u2019 Many religious leaders and politicians invoke religious values and call for strict border controls while many humanitarians use religious values to welcome and assist refugees. This book focuses on politics and discourses mobilized by religious beliefs; lived experiences of religion; and faith actors\u2019 responses to forced migration. El\u017cbieta M.

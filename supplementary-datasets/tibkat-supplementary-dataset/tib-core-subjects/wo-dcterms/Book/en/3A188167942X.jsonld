                "Construction is the means by which designing architects and engineers transform a design idea into built reality. It is from this perspective that the subject of 'building construction design' is dealt with by the architect Jos\u00e9 Luis Moro in three comprehensive volumes. Each is dedicated to the methodological, physical and functional fundamentals, the conception of a constructional solution, and finally its implementation in the constructional detail. Not only do the three volumes provide extensive content; they also ensure the greatest possible clarity in the text and graphics, in order to make it easier for learners to access the material. Importantly, they focus not only on conveying technical and scientific information, but also on demonstrating the complex relationships and interactions between design, material and construction. Great importance was attached to developing consistent, overarching and meaningful correlations between the numerous and highly diverse topics covered. After an introduction to planning theory topics, Volume 1 (\"Fundamentals\") addresses sustainability issues in the context of constructional design. This is followed by a discussion of the most important material-related considerations and their consequences for the constructional application of the materials. The range of currently available industrial building products is also presented. Furthermore, the essential requirements and functions that building structures must fulfill from a structural, building physics, building acoustics and fire protection perspective are examined. In closing, the book considers questions of durability.

He is a member of both the Faculty of Architecture and Faculty of Civil Engineering. His research chiefly focuses on the building envelope and design-relevant interactions between structure and architectural form. Professor Moro has had his own architectural practice since 1990."

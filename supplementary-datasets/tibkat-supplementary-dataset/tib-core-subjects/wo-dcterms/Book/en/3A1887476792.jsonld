            "abstract": "\"This book discusses the role and significance of symbols and symbolism in graphical communication towards the establishment of meaningful architecture. It explores how these are effectively applied in architectural education for learner's empowerment in various cultures around the world. The volume examines the developments in graphic representations while recognizing the importance of cognition and its perception in spatial terms. In a scenario where architectural education is at crossroads facing the challenges of global nature, this book highlights the importance of understanding architectural curriculum and design subjects. The author discusses the issues of communicating the knowledge of architecture to heterogeneous groups of students and explains how design fields and learning in architecture can be modified through cognitive instructional methods. The book outlines the methodology to develop symbols and symbolic pedagogical tools for effective communication in architecture. The book will appeal to students, researchers, teachers, and scholars of architecture, design, planning and visual communication. It will also be of interest to architects, artists, spatial designers, town planners, urban planners, and professionals\"--",

                "This open access book invites readers to learn how to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms to perform their research in oceanography. Various examples are exhibited to guide details of how to feed the big ocean data into the AI models to analyze and achieve optimized results. The number of scholars engaged in AI oceanography research will increase exponentially in the next decade. Therefore, this book will serve as a benchmark providing insights for scholars and graduate students interested in oceanography, computer science, and remote sensing. ."

                "Governance in Transition Societies brings together a diverse group of scholars from East and Southeast Asia with an interest in political transitions. The edited volume critically examines the nuances of governance and political change in the region. The book will be of interest to scholars, practitioners and students who are concerned with political and developmental trends in East and Southeast Asia. Contributors offer comparative insights that will appeal to a wider audience concerned with emerging patterns of governance and democracy. Adam Tyson, Associate Professor and Pro Dean International, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Leeds, UK This book brings together scholars based in, or had previously been based in a range of East and Southeast Asian countries, building on their respective primary empirical data and first-hand experience as academics and think tank researchers, in order to pluralise the current debates about governance in transitional societies. In an era of global democratic backsliding, this edited volume offers less-explored local perspectives, to balance the Western-centrism observed in area studies and the focus on former Soviet countries in transit. What is the future of governance in Asia? This book, by attempting to supply a diversity of answers, will interest political scientists, economists, and journalists.

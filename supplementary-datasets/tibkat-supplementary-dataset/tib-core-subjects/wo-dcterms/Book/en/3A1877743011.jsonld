            "abstract": "This book presents new insights into the development of different aspects of petroleum science and engineering. The book contains 19 chapters divided into two main sections: (i) Exploration and Production and (ii) Environmental Solutions. There are 11 chapters in the first section, and the focus is on the topics related to exploration and production of oil and gas, such as characterization of petroleum source rocks, drilling technology, characterization of reservoir fluids, and enhanced oil recovery. In the second section, the special emphasis is on waste technologies and environmental cleanup in the downstream sector. The book written by numerous prominent scholars clearly shows the necessity of the multidisciplinary approach to sustainable development in the petroleum industry and stresses the most updated topics such as EOR and environmental cleanup of fossil fuel wastes",

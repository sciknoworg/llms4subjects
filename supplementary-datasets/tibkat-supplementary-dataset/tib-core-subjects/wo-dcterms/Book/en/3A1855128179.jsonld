            "abstract": "\"Reflecting on the depth of the experience with crises, this innovative book demonstrates what the world can learn from insights into crises from the Japanese perspective. Taking an institutionalist approach with a strong historical precedent, leading scholars in the social sciences and law explore how better to deal with both foreseeable and unforeseen crises. Illustrating their multifaceted and complex nature, the book examines a broad range of crises throughout history, including economic, fiscal and political crises; force majeure events such as pandemics and natural disasters; and military conflicts and acts of war. Chapters consider how various actors anticipate and deal with these crises, looking closely at their different perceptions of crisis and varying degrees of urgency. Analyzing institutional design and response, and the impact of psychological factors on disaster preparedness, the book considers how the decision-making capabilities of individuals can be enhanced to improve institutional capacity. Transdisciplinary, with an international reach, this topical book will prove invaluable to students and scholars across the social sciences, particularly those interested in Asian politics and environmental policy, disaster preparedness and institutional design. It also provides guidance for policymakers working in civil code reform\"--",

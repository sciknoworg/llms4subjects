            "abstract": "Japan\u2019s G20 presidency 2019 asked the International Energy Agency to analyse progress in G20 countries towards technology innovation to accelerate energy transitions. The Japan presidency, which began on 1 December 2018 and runs through 30 November 2019, has placed a strong focus on innovation, business and finance.1 In the areas of energy and the environment, Japan wishes to create a \u201cvirtuous cycle between the environment and growth\u201d, which is the core theme of the G20 Ministerial Meeting on Energy Transitions and Global Environment for Sustainable Growth in Karuizawa, Japan, 15-16 June 2019. A first draft report was presented to the 2nd meeting of the G20 Energy Transitions Working Group (ETWG), held through 18-19 April 2019. This final report incorporates feedback and comments submitted during April by the G20 membership and was shared with the ETWG members. This final report is cited in \u201cProposed Documents for the Japanese Presidency of the G20\u201d that was distributed to the G20 energy ministers, who convened in Karuizawa on 15-16 June 2019. This report, prepared as an input for the 2019 G20 ministerial meeting, is an IEA contribution; it is not submitted for formal approval by energy ministers, nor does it reflect the G20 membership\u2019s national or collective views. The report sets out around 100 \u201cinnovation gaps\u201d, that is, key innovation needs in each energy technology area that require additional efforts, including through global collaboration.",

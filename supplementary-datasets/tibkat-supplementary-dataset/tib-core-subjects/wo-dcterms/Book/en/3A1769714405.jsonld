                "This open access book draws the big picture of how population change interplays with politics across the world from 1990 to 2040. Leading social scientists from a wide range of disciplines discuss, for the first time, all major political and policy aspects of population change as they play out differently in each major world region: North and South America; Sub-Saharan Africa and the MENA region; Western and East Central Europe; Russia, Belarus and Ukraine; East Asia; Southeast Asia; subcontinental India, Pakistan and Bangladesh; Australia and New Zealand. These macro-regional analyses are completed by cross-cutting global analyses of migration, religion and poverty, and age profiles and intra-state conflicts. From all angles, this book shows how strongly contextualized the political management and the political consequences of population change are. While long-term population ageing and short-term migration fluctuations present structural conditions, political actors play a key role in (mis-)managing, manipulating, and (under-)planning population change, which in turn determines how citizens in different groups react. Achim Goerres, PhD (LSE), is Professor of Empirical Political Science at the Department of Political Science and the Interdisciplinary Centre for Integration and Migration Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. Pieter Vanhuysse, PhD (LSE), is Professor of Politics and Public Policy at the Department of Political Science and the Danish Centre for Welfare Studies at the University of Southern Denmark, and Senior Fellow of Social Sciences at the Danish Institute for Advanced Study, Denmark."

                "This book provides the background needed to understand not only the wide field of polymer processing, but also the emerging technologies associated with the plastics industry in the 21st Century. It combines practical engineering concepts with modeling of realistic polymer processes. Divided into three sections, it provides the reader with a solid knowledge base in polymer materials, polymer processing, and modeling. 'Understanding Polymer Processing' is intended for the person who is entering the plastics manufacturing industry and as a textbook for students taking an introductory course in polymer processing. It also serves as a guide to the practicing engineer when choosing a process, determining important parameters and factors during the early stages of process design, and when optimizing such a process. Practical examples illustrating basic concepts are presented throughout the book. New in the second edition is a chapter on additive manufacturing, together with associated examples, as well as improvements and corrections throughout the book. Contents:  o Part I - Polymeric Materials This section gives a general introduction to polymers, including mechanical behavior of polymers and melt rheology o Part II   Polymer Processing The major polymer processes are introduced in this section, including extrusion, mixing, injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding, film blowing, and many others. o Part III   Modeling This last section delivers the tools to allow the engineer to solve back-of-the-envelope polymer processing models. It includes dimensional analysis and scaling, transport phenomena in polymer processing, and modeling polymer processes  Tim A. Osswald is Kuo and Cindy F. Wang Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Engineering and Honorary Professor of Plastics Technology at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and the National University of Colombia. He is author of many books and book chapters, as well as over 100 papers in the field of plastics technology."

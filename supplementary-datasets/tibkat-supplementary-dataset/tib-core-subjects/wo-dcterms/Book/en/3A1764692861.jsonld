            "abstract": "\"Offshore platforms face many risks, including a hostile ocean environment, extreme temperatures, overpressure loads, fire risks, and hydrocarbon explosions, all of which pose unique challenges in designing their topside platforms. The topside design also involves the selection of appropriate materials to reduce fire risk without compromising the functional requirements. These platforms serve valuable, utility, production, and processing purposes, and can also provide living quarters for personnel. Concepts such as basic design, special design, materials selection, and risk hazards are explained in the authors' straightforward classroom style, and are based on their rich experience in both academia and industry. Features Includes practical examples which are solved using international codes to offer a better understanding of the subjects presented Addresses safety and risk of offshore platforms, and considers numerous topside accident scenarios Discusses the structural and mechanical properties of various materials, such as steel and newer functionally graded materials (FGMs) Design Aids for Offshore Topside Platforms Under Special Loads serves as a design manual for multi-disciplinary engineering graduates and practicing professionals working in civil, mechanical, offshore, naval, and petroleum engineering fields. In addition, the book will serve as reference manual for practicing design engineers and risk assessors\"",

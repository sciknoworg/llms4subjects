            "abstract": "\"This unique volume presents the practical tools for architects and urban designers to improve the work processes of architectural design-from the conception to the construction, taking into consideration the personalized world of users, architects, and urban designers. Theory of Experience in Architecture and Urban Design starts from the conception of architectural space as a continuum that goes from the subjective depth of the mind to the objective reality, taking into consideration the perspective of building experiences for users. It is based on the idea that at the heart of that continuum is the experience of architecture and the city as the element that unites them and gives them meaning. The book is divided into two parts. The first part defines what the architectural experience is from the processes of perception, cognition, and evaluation that users and architects make about workplaces and programs. It deals with the phenomenology of the architectural experience from what creates the sense of place and then looks at the taxonomy of the areas of experience and the implications for the architect's work processes. The second part of the book deals with the knowledge and use of tools for the diagnosis of users and places. This section provides the methods that will help to understand the architectural experience desired by the main users of both the architectural object and an urban design, providing a series of techniques that have been proved effective. Key features: Describes the theoretical approaches, methods, and tools necessary for architectural and urban design for creating experiences for users. Provides a deep understanding of the nature of built environments and what they express. Discusses specific methods for in-depth research on users' subjective space through making meaningful contact with them and through appropriate technological means, such as research on their expressions and communications on virtual social networks. This book will help to make urban architects and designers aware of their importance for the implementation of public policies that will work in the very long term, with the expectation that by becoming aware of this role, they can act in accordance with an ethic based on values of protection of life, human solidarity, compassion, vitality, freedom, equality between people and social justice\"--",

            "abstract": "Pakistan is facing a large deficit in electricity supply. A report published by the Government of Pakistan (GoP) in 2013 showed that the electricity supply-demand gap has continuously grown over the past five years and has reached 4,500 to 5,500 Megawatt (MW) in 2013. Such an enormous gap has led to load-shedding of 12-16 hours a day across the country. GoP has set a target to reduce the electricity supply-demand gap to zero by 2017. In order to attain such ambitious target, the GoP has been endeavoring to exploit various options to meet the current and future anticipated electricity needs of the country. In order to support the GoP, the World Bank (WB) has been providing assistance towards continued development of renewable power (RE) generation (hydro, biomass, solar and wind). Therefore, the energy sector meets electricity demand in an efficient, affordable and environmentally sustainable manner. Biomass resource mapping is one of component of the ongoing renewable energy resource mapping project in Pakistan. The objective of this biomass mapping component is to support the sustainable expansion of electricity generation from biomass. This is fulfilled by providing the national government and provincial authorities in Pakistan, and commercial project developers, with an improved understanding of the location and potential of biomass resources. This project is being implemented by the World Bank in Pakistan in close coordination with the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB), a government agency of Pakistan. The project is funded by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), a global knowledge and technical assistance program administered by the WB and supported by eleven bilateral donors. It is part of a major ESMAP initiative in support of renewable energy resource mapping and geospatial planning across multiple countries",

                "This book is intended for students, academics, designers, process engineers and CMM operators, and presents the ISO GPS and the ASME GD&T rules and concepts. The Geometric Product Specification (GPS) and Geometrical Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) languages are in fact the most powerful tools available to link the perfect geometrical world of models and drawings to the imperfect world of manufactured parts and assemblies. The topics include a complete description of all the ISO GPS terminology, datum systems, MMR and LMR requirements, inspection, and gauging principles. Moreover, the differences between ISO GPS and the American ASME Y14.5 standards are shown as a guide and reference to help in the interpretation of drawings of the most common dimensioning and tolerancing specifications. The book may be used for engineering courses and for professional grade programmes, and it has been designed to cover the fundamental geometric tolerancing applications as well as the more advanced ones. Academics and professionals alike will find it to be an excellent teaching and research tool, as well as an easy-to-use guide. This 2nd, revised edition includes several improved features: - It highlights the tools provided in the recently published ISO GPS standards, such as ISO 22081-2021 and ISO 2692-2021. - New concepts and rules in accordance with the latest revision to the GD&T standard, ASME Y14.5.1-2019, Mathematical Definition of Dimensioning and Tolerancing Principles. - Most of the drawings have been redrawn and updated even further to the new standards. - Changes have been made to the text and illustrations to improve readability and clarify the content Additional contents and examples have been included. - The chapters dedicated to profile tolerance and tolerances (ISO 14405) have been extended and rewritten.",

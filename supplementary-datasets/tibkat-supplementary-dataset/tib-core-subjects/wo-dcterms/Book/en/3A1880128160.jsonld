            "abstract": "\"Production processes and engineered systems often involve continuous and discrete variables, and the combination of continuous and sequential operation regimes. Both aspects have been deeply investigated resulting in vast knowledge areas for continuous and discrete control, logic control, as well as hybrid control systems. The scope of this book is the compilation of selected control strategies to automate processes and systems with a practical approach to ease their design, analysis and implementation. The selection of the control schemes is based on capability to provide desired dynamical response or real time performance. Practicity is meant for achieving faster development times of automation projects or system prototypes, by a comprehensive presentation and direct application of methodologies and techniques for efficient and structured programming of control algorithms. Considered methodologies include model-based design, hardware in the loop simulations and structured programming. Signals and systems concepts are exposed as required fundamentals for control, and explored with discrete-time numerical solutions, instead of sophisticated and expensive design and analysis software. PID based control, internal model control and model reference control are reviewed as powerful schemes in terms of performance and suitability for mechatronics systems because of the use of the model in their architecture as a key control element. Finite state machines and Petri nets are presented to solve sequential requirements of direct and supervisory control of many processes and machines. Cyberphysical systems are an industrial technology and an education trend, distinguished by the visual and dynamic models or digital twins of the physical systems. The discussed analysis, design and implementation practices are integrated and applied in the context of cyberphysical systems. This book aims to support multidisciplinary engineers and practitioners in the design of control systems, and is a valuable tool for automation teaching and self-learning\"--",

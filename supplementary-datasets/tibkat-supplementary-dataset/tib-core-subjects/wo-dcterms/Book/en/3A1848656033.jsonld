            "abstract": "\"This unique compendium provides a fact-based analysis of the most prominent energy issues of our time. It covers the period when the Covid pandemic swept across the world and substantially altered energy production and consumption. It discusses lessons learned following the reopening of economies around the world, and recognizes that we are in the midst of the energy transition. Insights into key energy topics, such as the timing of the energy transition and the need for a reliable energy portfolio for national security, are included. Some highlights of the new edition include discussions of climate change; lessons learned from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine; introduction to small-scale, modular nuclear fission reactors; updates on the status of nuclear fusion reactor prototypes; advances in solar power plants and transparent photovoltaic cells; improvements in large-scale wind power; tidal and wave energy converters; oil from algae; the EU Supergrid; the transition to electric vehicles and its impact on demand for oil; and updating the Goldilocks Policy forecast. This textbook can also serve as a useful reference for students, decision makers, opinion leaders and the general public. Previous editions have been used as an introductory energy text for college and MBA students\"--",

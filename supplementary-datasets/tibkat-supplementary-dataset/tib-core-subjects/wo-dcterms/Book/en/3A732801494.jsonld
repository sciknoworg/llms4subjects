The first, treating of the proper positions and different attitudes for men and women, from which all the steps are to be taken and performed; adorned with instructive figures: with a description of the menuet figure, shewing the beautiful turns and graceful motions of the body in that dance. The second, of the use and graceful motion of the arms with the legs in taking the proper movements and forming the contracts, with figures for the better explanation. The whole containing sixty figures drawn from the life, and curiously engraved on copper plates. Done from the French of Monsieur Rameau, by J. Essex, dancing-master",
            "abstract": "This is a translation of one of the most important sources for the study and reconstruction of eighteenth-century dance--Pierre Rameau's 1725 Le ma\u00eetre a danser. Translated by English dancer and writer John Essex (c. 1680-1744), part one of the text and accompanying full-page plates carefully focus on the appropriate manner of walking, feet positions, and bows, and describe a large vocabulary of steps. Part two covers use of the arms while dancing. This English translation was reissued in 1732",

                "Now in an expanded and revised second edition, this book explores sustainability engineering through the lens of the manufacturing and chemical process industries to explain the safe and economical implementation of process designs to transform raw materials into valuable finished products. The author applies the principles of sustainability science to engineering methodology for residential, commercial, and industrial applications that support the perpetual availability of raw materials through recycling, reuse, and repurposing to incorporate inexhaustible supplies and encompasses the management and conservation of these resources in a manner that minimizes negative environmental impacts. New sections include: Coverage of electric power opportunities and challenges (solar, wind, and cogeneration); Efficiency improvement as an energy supply extender; Recycling as a material extender. The book examines relevant energy policies driving and affecting commercial, industrial, and residential energy utilization and includes new industrial case studies. Anyone involved in the design or manufacture of chemicals or the upgrade of existing manufacturing processes will benefit from this book\u2019s suggestions for identifying improvement options while adding the pivotal aspect of sustainability to the usual cost and safety equation optimization elements. A practical, systematic approach introducing holistic process designs emphasizing sustainability as a core requirement; How to combine chemical, mechanical, and natural processes to optimize material and energy utilization sustainably; Suitable for preparing young chemical engineers in the capstone course of senior process design. .",

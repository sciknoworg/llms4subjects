                "Have you ever wanted to include believable physicalbehaviors in your games and projects to give them that extra edge? Physics for JavaScript Games, Animation, andSimulations teaches you how to incorporate real physics, such as gravity,friction, and buoyancy, into your HTML5 games, animations, and simulations. Italso includes more advanced topics, such as particle systems, which areessential for creating effects such as sparks or smoke. The book also addressesthe key issue of balancing accuracy and simplicity in your games andsimulations, and the final chapters provide you with the information and thecode to make the right choice for your project. Physics for JavaScriptGames, Animation, and Simulations assumes you have a basic knowledge ofJavaScript and HTML5. However, no previous knowledge of physics isrequired-only some very basic math skills. The authors present everything frombasic principles to advanced concepts in an approachable way, so you\u2019ll be ableto follow the logic and easily adapt the principles to your own applications. The book is packed full of practical examples of how you canapply physics to your own games and applications.Spring behaviors can be used for anything from tweaking lowrider suspension tocreating cloth simulation; flotationmechanics enable the simulation of submersibles or dirigibles; you can even createyour own solar system with accurate orbits and gravity. It doesn\u2019t matter ifyou\u2019re modeling the Lorentz force in an electromagnetic field or you\u2019remodeling the lift force in a flight simulator, Physics for JavaScript Games, Animation, and Simulations enablesyou to fill your games and applications with accurate and realistic effects",

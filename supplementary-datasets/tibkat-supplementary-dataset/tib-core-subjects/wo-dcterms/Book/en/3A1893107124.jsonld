                "\u2018This collection takes us on a journey through philosophical, theoretical, institutional and policy approaches to the multifaceted federal phenomenon, with pluralism as a method and general theme. With an impressive team of emerging and established scholars as guides, the volume offers a rich kaleidoscope of insights about the potential and pitfalls of federalism as a normative and institutional response to the challenge and promise of pluralism.\u2019 \u2014 Johanne Poirier, McGill University, and Holder of the Peter MacKell Chair in Federalism, Canada. \u2018A pluralist exploration is what is needed to grasp the many facets of federalism, a concept that lives of and nurtures diversity. Pluralism is the essence of federalism, its raison d\u2019\u00eatre, its beginning and ending. The book offers a contemporary account of such richness, bringing together key topics and outstanding contributors.\u2019 \u2014 Francesco Palermo, University of Verona, and Director of the Institute for Comparative Federalism, Eurac Research, Italy. This edited volume provides a solid yet accessible set of contributions for students, specialists, and practitioners of federalism. It also entails a commitment to normalizing the connection between federal studies and scholarship on pluralism and diversity management. With the objective to shed light on a specific theme using the means of a rigorous comprehensive comparative approach, most chapters compare at least two federal systems in connection with a given institutional matter or area of public policy.

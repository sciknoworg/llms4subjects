            "abstract": "This book is a collection of short essays, accessible through open access, which takes the interested reader on a tour across the global higher education landscape. It addresses pertinent themes and challenges in higher education. To mark the 70th anniversary of the International Association of Universities (IAU) and its role in higher education since 1950, experts from around the world share their insights into higher education\u2019s recent past, present and future. The book is divided into six parts: Part I \u2013 \u201c70 years of Higher Education Cooperation and Advocacy\u201d looks back at key events in IAU\u2019s history, its mission and significant activities over time, and remarks on the current global context informing its quest to promote academic partnerships and solidarity on a global scale. Part II \u2013 \u201cFacilitating International Cooperation\u201d provides for different perspectives on the transformation of the internationalisation of higher education and the contribution of higher education to international cooperation. Part III \u2013 \u201cCoding the Values\u201d debates the values upon which higher education was, is and will have to be built to provide for a democratic and inclusive society. Part IV \u2013 \u201cThe Changing Landscape\u201d analyses various aspects of the transformation of higher education in an evolving context across the globe. Part V \u2013 \u201cThe Promise of Education\u201d reflects on the role of higher education, its ideals and shortfalls and what it must do to stay true to its promise to help shape our societies. Part VI \u2013 \u201cOpening up \u2013 The Future of Higher Education\u201d focuses on future scenarios of higher education and call on the reader to envision a different kind of higher education and reimagine the contribution of higher education to society, as well as future roles for the IAU. The book will be of interest to higher education policy makers and academics. It is also of interest to the general public, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges higher education institutions currently face and suggests scenarios of what the future of education might look like",

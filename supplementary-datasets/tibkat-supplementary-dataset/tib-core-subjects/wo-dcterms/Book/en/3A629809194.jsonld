            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Now available in Softcover! This 2nd edition of Plastics is now available in softcover. It provides readers with a good overall general working knowledge of the subject and it aims to give systematic and complete coverage of finishing, from basic fabrication through to the more recent technical ingenuities, which radically change the key characteristics of materials. The book embraces all aspects of the decoration and surface finishing of plastics, reviewing the techniques used, the types of material for which they may be employed, necessary pre-treatments, the problems of finishing (including how to overcome them and methods of test), and possible uses. The fabrication of natural materials, such as bone or horn, was the traditional craft from which the modern industry was born and the book explains how methods and machinery have been adapted, modified and developed for work with plastics. Written by contributors with wide industrial experience, the book is aimed at advanced undergraduates, researchers and technicians, as well as designers of consumer products and those with a general interest in plastics.  It will also prove to be valuable reading for anyone planning a career in manufacturing, not just for plastics but any field in which packaging is used, such as food products or pharmaceuticals",

As well as encompassing a diverse range of collaborative forms and themes, and involving a variety of stakeholders, these collaborative initiatives are all notably shaped by the dynamics of the particular contexts in which they operate. These contexts include individual, organizational, sectoral, spatial, and geographical settings. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on partnering for the SDGs is also apparent. The interplay between these elements offers a useful global\u2013local context for further inquiry and reflection on how deeper and more meaningful collaborative relationships might be developed to achieve the SDG targets and beyond",

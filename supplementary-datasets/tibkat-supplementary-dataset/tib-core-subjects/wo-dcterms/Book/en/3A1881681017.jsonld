                "This book provides an opportunity for researchers, scientists, government officials, strategist and operators and maintainers of large, complex and advanced systems and infrastructure to update their knowledge with the state of best practice in the challenging domains while networking with the leading representatives, researchers and solution providers. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), coupled with the prolificacy of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are creating smart societies that are interconnected. Space exploration and satellite, drone and UAV technology have travelled a long way in recent years and some may debate that we are in the midst of a revolution; in terms of development and the increasing number of these devices being launched. But with this revolutionary progress, it presents itself with new challenges in terms of governance. The ethical implications of connecting the physical and digital worlds, and presenting the reality of a truly interconnected society, presents the realization of the concept of smart societies in reality. Drawing on 14 years of successful events on Information security, digital forensics and cybercrime, the 15th ICGS3-23 conference aims to provide attendees with an information-packed agenda with representatives from across the industry and the globe. The challenges of complexity, rapid pace of change and risk/opportunity issues associated with modern products, systems, special events and infrastructures. In an era of unprecedented volatile, political and economic environment across the world, computer based systems face ever more increasing challenges, disputes and responsibilities and while the Internet has created a global platform for the exchange of ideas, goods and services, however, it has also created boundless opportunities for cyber-crime. This book presents new materials and contributes to knowledge through the technological advances that are being made across artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, blockchain and quantum computing. These technologies driven by a digital revolution are expected to be disruptive and provide major digital transformation in the way societies operate today. As a result, these advances provide social and economic benefits, but, also, provide new challenges that security industry need to raise their game to combat them."

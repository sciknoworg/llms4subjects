            "abstract": "The G.B. Elyakov Pacific Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Far-Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (PIBOC FEB RAS) was founded in 1964 in Vladivostok in the Far East of Russia. Over many years, we have been carrying out studies on the natural products of both marine and terrestrial origin. In collaboration with many Russian and foreign scientists, we have investigated many hundreds of diverse biomolecules, including steroids and terpenoids, quinoid compounds and alkaloids, polysaccharides and lipids, enzymes and lectins, proteins, and peptides. The Institute has a collection of marine microorganisms (KMM) PIBOC, which includes more than 4000 strains of marine bacteria and more than 1000 strains of marine fungi. The biological activity of natural compounds is also being studied. This book includes the 14 manuscripts which covered almost all aspects of PIBOC research activity in the fields of bioorganic chemistry, biochemistry, organic synthesis of natural compounds, marine microbiology, and genetic engineering, and we hope it will provide interesting new information for scientists working in these fields",

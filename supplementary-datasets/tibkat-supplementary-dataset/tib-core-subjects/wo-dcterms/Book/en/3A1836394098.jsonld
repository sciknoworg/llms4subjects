            "abstract": "\"During the Late Bronze Age, the Iron Age and early medieval period (c. 600 BC\u2013AD 1250) settlement at Vik in the \u00d8rland peninsula emerged, flourished, vanished and emerged anew. Local landscape and vegetation development, cross-regional cultural developments and global climatic events were of great significance to the farmer-fisher communities at Vik throughout these periods.  In this book, results from the 2014\u20132016 archaeological excavations at \u00d8rland main air base have been refined and developed. The 13 papers deal with landscape, vegetation and environmental aspects related to the excavated settlement, as well as the spatial and social organization of the built environment. Building traditions, disposal practices, the form and representation of everyday objects, subsistence and landscape use are central to the discussions.\"",

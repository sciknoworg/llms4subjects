            "title": "Emergent Quantum Mechanics. David Bohm Centennial Perspectives",
            "abstract": "Emergent quantum mechanics explores the possibility of an ontology for quantum mechanics. The resurgence of interest in \"\"deeper-level\"\" theories for quantum phenomena challenges the standard, textbook interpretation. The book presents expert views that critically evaluate the significance\u2014for 21st century physics\u2014of ontological quantum mechanics, an approach that David Bohm helped pioneer. The possibility of a deterministic quantum theory was first introduced with the original de Broglie-Bohm theory, which has also been developed as Bohmian mechanics. The wide range of perspectives that were contributed to this book on the occasion of David Bohm\u2019s centennial celebration provide ample evidence for the physical consistency of ontological quantum mechanics. The book addresses deeper-level questions such as the following: Is reality intrinsically random or fundamentally interconnected? Is the universe local or nonlocal? Might a radically new conception of reality include a form of quantum causality or quantum ontology? What is the role of the experimenter agent? As the book demonstrates, the advancement of \u2018quantum ontology\u2019\u2014as a scientific concept\u2014marks a clear break with classical reality. The search for quantum reality entails unconventional causal structures and non-classical ontology, which can be fully consistent with the known record of quantum observations in the laboratory",

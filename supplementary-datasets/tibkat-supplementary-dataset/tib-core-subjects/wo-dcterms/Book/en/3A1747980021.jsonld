                "This book includes a collection of research and practical papers from international research and technology activities on recent developments in infrastructure engineering. Sustainability is increasingly a key priority in engineering practices. With the aging transportation infrastructure and renewed emphasis on infrastructure renovation by transportation agencies, innovations are urgently needed to develop materials, designs, and practices to ensure the sustainability of transportation infrastructure."

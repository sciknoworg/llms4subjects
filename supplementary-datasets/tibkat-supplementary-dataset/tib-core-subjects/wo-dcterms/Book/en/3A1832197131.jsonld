                "\"The essential guide for data scientists and for leaders who must get more from their data science teams. The Economist boldly claims that data are now 'the world's most valuable resource.' But, as Kenett and Redman so richly describe, unlocking that value requires far more than technical excellence. Individual data scientists must fully extend themselves. They must make sure they understand the real problems their companies and agencies face, they must build trust with decision-makers, deal with quality issues, help decision makers become more demanding customers of data science, and they must teach their colleagues how to understand and interpret data science--even conduct basic analyses themselves. Further up in the management chain, managers of data science teams must help senior leaders understand where data and data science fit, ensure their teams are placed in the right spots organizationally, and put in place programs that help the entire organization become data-driven. This Kenett and Redman claim, is the 'real work of data science.' And it is this work that will spells the difference between a good data scientist and a great one, between a team that makes marginal contributions and one that drives the business, between a company that gains some value from its data and one in which data truly is 'the most valuable resource'\"--"

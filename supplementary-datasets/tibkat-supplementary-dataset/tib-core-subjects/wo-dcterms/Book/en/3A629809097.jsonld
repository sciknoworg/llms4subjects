            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, The ongoing progress of science has shown that it is important for analytical scientists to determine not only the presence of particular elements, but also their species. There are many fields where this is applicable, and where there are a number of topics to be addressed. Developing separation and measurement systems for the many element species has tested the resourcefulness of analytical chemists over recent decades. A product of the EU sponsored Speciation 21 Network, this book presents a detailed review of the state-of-the-art of speciation issues in the occupational health, food and environment sectors, along with the main conclusions arising from discussions held during expert meetings. Topics covered include mercury and organotin compounds in the environment; factors affecting the health of workers; the importance of speciation of trace elements for health, and subsequent metabolism in the body; analytical methodologies; risk assessment; and legislation. Trace Element Speciation for Environment, Food and Health provides an insight into applied research in the speciation field and how it has become so important in all the fields represented.  With its comprehensive coverage, it will be of particular interest to researchers in industry and academia, as well as government agencies and legislative bodies",

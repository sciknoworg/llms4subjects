            "abstract": "Production costs are being reduced by automation, robotics, computer-integrated manufacturing, cost reduction studies and more. These new technologies are expensive to buy, repair, and maintain. Hence, the demand on maintenance is growing and its costs are escalating. This new environment is compelling industrial maintenance organizations to make the transition from fixing broken machines to higher-level business units for securing production capacity. On the academic front, research in the area of maintenance management and engineering is receiving tremendous interest from researchers. Many papers have appeared in the literature dealing with the modeling and solution of maintenance problems using operations research (OR) and management science (MS) techniques. This area represents an opportunity for making significant contributions by the OR and MS communities. Maintenance, Modeling, and Optimization provides in one volume the latest developments in the area of maintenance modeling. Prominent scholars have contributed chapters covering a wide range of topics. We hope that this initial contribution will serve as a useful informative introduction to this field that may permit additional developments and useful directions for more research in this fast-growing area. The book is divided into six parts and contains seventeen chapters. Each chapter has been subject to review by at least two experts in the area of maintenance modeling and optimization. The first chapter provides an introduction to major maintenance modeling areas illustrated with some basic models. Part II contains five chapters dealing with maintenance planning and scheduling. Part III deals with preventive maintenance in six chapters. Part IV focuses on condition-based maintenance and contains two chapters. Part V deals with integrated production and maintenance models and contains two chapters. Part VI addresses issues related to maintenance and new technologies, and also deals with Just-in-Time (JIT) and Maintenance",

            "abstract": "Computers and machines were developed to reduce time consumption and manual human efforts to complete projects efficiently. With fast-growing technologies in the field, we have finally reached a stage where almost everyone in the world has access to these high technologies. However, this is just a starting phase because future development is taking a more advanced route in the shape of artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI is under the computer science umbrella, nowadays there is no field unaffected by this high technology. The overall aim of using intelligence learning methods is to train machines to think intelligently and make decisions in different situations the same as humans. Previously, machines were doing what they were programmed to do, but now with AI, devices can think and behave like a human being. This book aims to present the application of advanced analytics and AI in different industries as practical tools to develop prediction, optimization, and make decision models",

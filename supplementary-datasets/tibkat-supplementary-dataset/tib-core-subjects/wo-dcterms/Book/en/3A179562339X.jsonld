            "abstract": "\"This ground-breaking book specifically focuses on the leadership of innovation and entrepreneurship in healthcare by providing a detailed step-by-step framework for effective leadership in the challenging and dynamic healthcare environment. Taking a fresh approach, it utilizes resources within healthcare organizations and the creative abilities of their people to provide a long-term solution to address key global issues, including the aging population, rising costs and long waiting lists, together with the challenges of staff recruitment and retention. Claudine Kearney offers in-depth insights into what is required to achieve success in the development of innovation. Chapters also demonstrate how to lead innovation, entrepreneurship and design thinking in healthcare as well as how to achieve results with a future oriented mindset. Visionary in its approach, the book examines both internal and external healthcare environment, addressing the key elements such as organizational strategy, culture and structure to overcome challenges. It also provides a thought-provoking analysis on the significant global challenges experienced within healthcare following the Covid-19 pandemic. Highlighting key learning points, this book will be an excellent resource for postgraduate students and scholars with a specific focus on medical and scientific innovations as well as those responsible for management within healthcare\"--",

            "abstract": "\"Foreword ASTM International has compiled this valuable companion resource to the American Welding Society (AWS) Structural Welding Code D1.1. All ASTM specifications, practices, and test methods referenced by the AWS Code are found in this publication as well as several other key welding standards. Some standards referenced in the D1.1 code have been withdrawn or superseded by newer ASTM standards, and these current versions are also included. The compilation will be a useful, one-source reference for a broad cross-section of users of AWS D1.1 including those quality professionals, such as inspectors, supervisors, engineers, and managers. The content was developed by the following three ASTM International Committees: A01 on Steel, Stainless Steel and Related Alloys; E07 on Nondestructive Testing; and E28 on Mechanical Testing. These committees, which meet twice a year, have jurisdiction over hundreds of standards. You can be part of this important initiative. ASTM members are individuals and corporations who contribute their expertise to influence the standards being set for their industries. The work of ASTM International members makes products and services safer, better, and more cost effective. In short, ASTM International standards contribute toward product quality, enhancing communication, and overall customer satisfaction\"--",

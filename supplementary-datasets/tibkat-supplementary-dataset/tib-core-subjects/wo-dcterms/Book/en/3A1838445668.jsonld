                "\u201cThis book is very timely. It sheds light on a better Metro Manila within the context of local governance, decentralization and equitable development. Metro Manila\u2019s experience is an excellent study of how institutions continue to evolve given the challenges of metropolitanization and rapid urbanization. This book is a must read for public administration and governance scholars and practitioners who want to understand metropolitan governance not only in the Philippines but in Asia as well.\u201d \u2014 Alex Brillantes, Jr., Professor, National College of Public Administration and Governance, University of the Philippines Diliman \u201cAs the editors convincingly assert, the framework of decentralized local governance in the Philippines is at a crossroads. Urban governance presents particularly daunting challenges, and nowhere more so than in the megalopolis of Metro Manila. In this landmark volume, authors present innovative and timely reform proposals across a range of policy realms. The volume offers a critical first step toward \u201ca better Metro Manila\u201d as it provides policy guidance toward the goal of more responsible local governance and more equitable development outcomes.\u201d \u2014 Paul D. Hutchcroft, Professor of Political Science and Social Change, Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs, The Australian National University This book contributes to efforts in furthering the democratization and development processes in the Philippines by examining the decentralization efforts in Metro Manila. It explores existing as well as proposed development models for governance with focus on the effective and efficient delivery of social services, bringing forth growth with equity through development efforts, and addressing national-local concerns to promote political and socio economic stability in the country. In doing so, the book examines the strong and weak governance points in the National Capital Region of the Philippines, and identifies areas for reform. Teresa S. Encarnacion Tadem is Professor of Political Science at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman and Executive Director, UP Center for Integrative and Development Studies (CIDS). Maria Ela L. Atienza is Professor of Political Science at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman and Co-Convenor, UP CIDS Program on Social and Political Change.",

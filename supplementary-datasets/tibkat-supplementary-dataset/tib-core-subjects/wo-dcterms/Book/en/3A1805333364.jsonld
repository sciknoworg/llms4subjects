                "This open access book explores techniques for working in the field of immunogenetics, i.e. fundamental and translational research into the adaptive immune receptor repertoire. Many chapters are dedicated to lab protocols, bioinformatics, and immunoinformatics analysis of high-resolution immunome analysis, exemplified by numerous applications. Additionally, the newest technological variations on these protocols are discussed, including non-amplicon, single-cell, and cell-free strategies. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and practical, Immunogenetics: Methods and Protocols covers a broad spectrum of methodologies for applications in research and clinical diagnostics to illustrate the impact that immunogenetics has achieved and will further expand in all fields of medicine, from infection and (auto)immunity, to vaccination, to lymphoid malignancy and tumor immunity.",

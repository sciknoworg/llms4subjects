            "abstract": "\"The possibility of future fluctuations in energy security and the potential for climate change-related environmental impacts require an emphasis on clean and renewable energies to safeguard the environment as well as economic stability. The current recalcitrant nature of biomass processing has led researchers to find the most suitable techniques for its depolymerization, as well as various strategies to pretreat biomass which include physical, thermochemical, and biochemical methods and a combination of these. Biomass Energy for Sustainable  Development examines how optimal biomass utilization can reduce forest management costs, help mitigate climate change, reduce risks to life and property, and help provide a secure, competitive energy source into the future. Provides a comprehensive review of biomass energy and focuses on in-depth understanding of various strategies to pretreat biomass including physical, chemical, and biological. Explores multidisciplinary, novel approaches including AI for furthering the understanding and generation of models, theories, and processes in the field of bioenergy. Covers the sustainable development goals for bioenergy, including the related concepts of bioeconomy and the potential environmental impact from reliance on bioenergy\"--",

                "This book aims at the upper-class undergraduate and the graduate students, and practicing engineers in the disciplines of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering, with background knowledge of control. This book, first, explains the components of the haptic systems that are gaining popularity in the virtual reality simulations, the metaverse applications, as well as the remotely operated robotic systems. Next, the book introduces the previous and current widely-adopted methods for modeling and control of the haptic systems. The important metrics of performance such as stability and transparency of the haptic systems are explained and analyzed. Shortcomings of the current methods are discussed using these metrics. The book, then, explains the theories on the input-to-state stability (ISS), and shows how to formulate the control of haptic systems into the ISS framework. Step by step process of control design using the formulation is detailed, and better results are shown with experiment examples. The book develops further the presented approach to secure improved performance under selected issues. For example, better transparency of the haptic rendering, and handling of constant or time-varying time delay present in the haptic control systems."

                "\"This timely Handbook investigates the many perspectives from which to reconsider teaching and learning within business schools, during a time in which higher education is facing challenges to the way teaching might be delivered in the future. Bringing together a diverse range of expert contributors, this Handbook fills gaps in current knowledge and research, whilst expanding and exploring new fields. Topics covered include the use and value of learning technologies, leadership education and continuous professional development of research-based teachers. Crucially, the Handbook considers how faculty at all levels of seniority will be forced to challenge their own modus operandi in designing and delivering teaching. This is especially important during and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, where blended learning should be carefully assessed before it is adopted as part of any course design. Offering both practical suggestions and cutting-edge research into the field, this Handbook will be a key resource for academics, practitioners and students in business and management education who wish to consolidate their teaching and learning and further understand the broader issues surrounding it\"--",

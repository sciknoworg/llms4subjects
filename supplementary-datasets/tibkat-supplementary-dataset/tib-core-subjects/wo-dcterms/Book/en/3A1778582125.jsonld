            "abstract": "What is going on in Kulturskolen \u2013 the Norwegian municipal school of music and performing arts? And what is the relation between the activities in the practice field and research? Kulturskolen is a type of school dependent on cooperation with others \u2013 kindergardens, primary and secondary schools, voluntary and professional cultural life, higher education and nonprofit organizations. The field of research related to Kulturskolen is similarly diverse; including both educational research, artistic research and organizational research.  This anthology is the result of IRISforsk, a research group linked to the development project for kulturskole named IRIS. The IRIS-project was executed in collaboration between The Norwegian Council for Schools of Music and Performing Art and The Savings Bank Foundation DNB/Dextra Musica, and ran from 2014 to 2016. The anthology includes 13 chapters, eight of which are scientific papers evaluated by external peer-review. Contributors in the anthology are affiliated with five different educational institutions. The chapters discuss and visualize the scope of music and art school related research, including didactics, professional-oriented and management-focused issues, as well as organizational cooperation, talent development and culture as a tool for inclusion. The anthology targets anyone with an interest in research and development in the music and art school related field \u2013 researchers, staff and students in artistic education, teacher education and management education, as well as teachers, managers and other practitioners in the field",

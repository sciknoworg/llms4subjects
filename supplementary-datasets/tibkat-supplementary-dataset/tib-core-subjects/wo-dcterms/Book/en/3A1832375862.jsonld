            "title": "Chapter 1 Education and the reform of social  inequalities in the Global South : An introduction",
            "abstract": "\"The introduction explains the rationale for focusing on education reform in relation to the tackling of social inequality in Southern contexts. The aim of the book is to bring together the analysis of past evidence of social inequality and the associated reforms that attempted to reduce it, with contemporary research evidence that highlights the ongoing challenges faced by disadvantaged groups as well as important potentially neglected aspects of social discrimination.  The introduction highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research and methodologies, including the perspectives of Southern researchers, for addressing progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Such collaborative dialogue challenges the boundaries and often taken-for granted assumptions of policy-making globally, nationally and locally. It aims to inform educational and social science researchers in different locations to improve their understanding about the complexity of social structures and values that influence socially unequal contexts. Overall, the aim of this edited collection is to consider how educational policy can work more effectively to promote social justice for all.\"",

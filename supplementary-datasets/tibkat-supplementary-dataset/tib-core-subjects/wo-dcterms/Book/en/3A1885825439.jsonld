                "The book presents practical information about the design and construction of building projects by addressing the principles of each method, unveiling background factors for requirements, and state-of-the-art application details. Science and technology provide thousands of construction materials, vast construction methods, and various construction equipment and tools for realizing diverse architectural and engineering design projects. From market perspectives for new participants, the current construction practices are chaotic, having wide material and method options with globally available traders. On the other hand, within this global market, there is a growing awareness and need for practical information among society and new participants in the industry about general and globally available construction methods and technologies. Rather than focusing on materials, available construction methods, and technologies were described in the book content concerning their classification systems. The subjects and topics are represented in a well-structured hierarchy supported by clear and narrative figures. The book presents general design and application principles of construction methods and technologies without diving into engineering calculations and formulas to keep the content easily understandable by all AEC practitioners and participants. Instead, state-of-the-art construction applications were explained to unveil the logic and application requirements at the background of systems and methods. It also serves as a teaching tool for undergraduate students in architecture, engineering, and construction.",

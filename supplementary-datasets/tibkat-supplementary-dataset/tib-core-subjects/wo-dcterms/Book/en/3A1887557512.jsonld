            "abstract": "Handbook of Surgical Planning and 3D Printing: Applications, Integration, and New Directions?covers 3D printing and surgical planning from clinical, technical and economic points-of-view. This book fills knowledge gaps by addressing: (1) What type of medical images are needed for 3D printing, and for which specific application? (2) What software should be used to process the images, should the software be considered a medical device? (3) Data protection? (4) What are the possible clinical applications and differences in imaging, segmentation, and 3D printing? And finally, (5) What skills, resources, and organization are needed?Sections cover technologies involved in 3D printing in health: data structure, medical images and segmentation, printing materials and 3d printing, 3D printing and Clinical Applications: orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, maxillofacial, orthodontistry, surgical guides, integrating 3D printing Service in Hospitals: infrastructures, competences, organization and cost/benefits, and more",

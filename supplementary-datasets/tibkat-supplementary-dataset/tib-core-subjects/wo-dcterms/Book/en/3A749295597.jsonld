            "abstract": "The problem of greenhouse gas (particularly carbon dioxide) release during power generation in fixed and mobile systems is widely acknowledged. Fuel cells are electrochemical devices offering clean and efficient energy production by the direct conversion of gaseous fuel into electricity. As such, they are under active study for commercial stationary power generation, residential applications and in transportation. The control of fuel cell systems under a variety of environmental conditions and over a wide operating range is a crucial factor in making them viable for extensive use in every-day technology. In Control of Fuel Cell Power Systems the application of fuel cells in automotive powertrains is emphasized because of the significance of the contribution to global CO2 emissions made by ground vehicle propulsion and because of the challenge presented by the accompanying control problems. The authors\u2019 comprehensive control-oriented approach provides: \u2022 An overview of the underlying physical principles and the main control objectives and difficulties associated with the implementation of fuel cell systems. \u2022 System-level dynamic models derived from the physical principles of the processes involved. \u2022 Formulation, in-depth analysis and detailed control design for two critical control problems, namely, the control of the cathode oxygen supply for a high-pressure direct hydrogen fuel cell system and control of the anode hydrogen supply from a natural gas fuel processor system. \u2022 Multivariable controllers that attenuate restraints resulting from lack of sensor fidelity or actuator authority. \u2022 Real-time observers for stack variables that confer redundancy in fault detection processes. \u2022 Examples of the assistance of control analysis in fuel cell redesign and performance improvement. \u2022 Downloadable SIMULINK\u00ae model of a fuel cell for immediate use supplemented by sample MATLAB\u00ae files with which to run it and reproduce some of the book plots. Primarily intended for researchers and students with a control background looking to expand their knowledge of fuel cell technology, Control of Fuel Cell Power Systems will also appeal to practicing fuel cell engineers through the simplicity of its models and the application of control algorithms in concrete case studies. The thorough coverage of control design will be of benefit to scientists dealing with the electrochemical, materials and fluid-dynamic aspects of fuel cells. Advances in Industrial Control ...",

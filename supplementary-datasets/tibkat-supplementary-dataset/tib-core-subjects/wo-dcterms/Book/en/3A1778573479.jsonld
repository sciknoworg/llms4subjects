            "title": "A Critical Evaluation of Vitamin D - Clinical Overview",
            "abstract": "Vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin, also called as \"\"sunshine vitamin\"\" is derived mostly from sun exposure and food, and for normal activation, it has to undergo two hydroxylation reactions. Vitamin D affects more than 2000 genes in the body. Serum level of 25(OH) D is an ideal indicator of vitamin D status in our body. Vitamin D deficiency leads to various diseases. On a therapeutic point of view, vitamin D helps to treat many diseases. The book \"\"A Critical Evaluation of Vitamin D - Clinical Overview\"\" targets the principles, mechanisms, and clinical significance of vitamin D. This book covers four sections: \"\"Vitamin D in Cardiovascular and Renal Diseases\"\", \"\"Vitamin D in Age and Neurological Diseases\"\", \"\"Vitamin D and Cancer\"\" and \"\"Therapeutic Measurements of Vitamin D\"\". Each of these sections is interwoven with the theoretical aspects and experimental techniques of basic and clinical sciences. This book will be a significant source to students, scientists, physicians, healthcare professionals and also other members of this society who are interested in exploring the role of vitamin D in human life. <br /><br />[Vitamin D can be considered as vitamin of \"\"defense\"\" since it cures several diseases. - Sivakumar Gowder]",

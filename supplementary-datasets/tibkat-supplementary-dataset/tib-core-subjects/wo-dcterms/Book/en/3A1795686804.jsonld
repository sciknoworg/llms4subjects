Our work on cross-border transactions in markets such as Asia, Europe, Latin America, India, and the Middle East has revealed a tremendous appetite for skilled resources throughout the globe. Therefore, this book fulfills an important need as a valuable training material and reliable handbook for finance professionals in these markets. This book also provides essential tools for professionals at corporations, including members of business development, M&A, finance, and treasury departments. These specialists are responsible for corporate finance, valuation, and transaction-related deliverables on a daily basis. They also work with investment bankers on various M&A transactions (including leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and related financings), as well as IPOs, restructurings, and other capital markets transactions. Similarly, this book is intended to provide greater context for the legions of attorneys, consultants, and accountants focused on M&A, corporate finance, and other transaction advisory services\"--",

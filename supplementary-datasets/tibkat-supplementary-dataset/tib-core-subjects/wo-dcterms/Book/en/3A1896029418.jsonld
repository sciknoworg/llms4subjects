                "This book provides a detailed study and assessment of water resources management and pollution control in different BRICS countries. The regions involved are Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. This book gives important insight into how future sustainability depends on the development of effective water governance mechanisms at the level of countries. According to the regional characteristics from different aspects it cuts into the water environment problems and studies in different ways, which is multifaceted and targeted. Using case studies that include environmentally integrated basin experiments (eibex) of Brazil, groundwater overflow zone of India, semi-arid river basin of South Africa and so on, this volume provides critical information for researchers and policymakers."

            "title": "Environmental law and policy in Cameroon - Towards making Africa the tree of life | Droit et politique de l'environnement au Cameroun - Afin de faire de l'Afrique l'arbre de vie",
            "abstract": "Cameroon - formerly a German colony situated at the Gulf of Guinea - is a geostrategically relevant Central African country rich in natural resources. Cameroonian law is a fascination stemming from different sources of law. The influences of British and French law, combined with the customary law of the numerous ethnic groups, are a reflection of the existing legal pluralism - also in the area of environmental protection. The publication adapts itself to today's language policy of Cameroon, which is predetermined by its Constitution, including both English and French chapters. Cameroonian environmental law and national environmental policy are examined in the interplay of international environmental norms and standards. It also addresses the environmental law of the African Union and that of the regional economic communities in Central Africa. In detail, topics such as environmental management, water and land law, conservation of biodiversity, resource protection law, mining and energy law, criminal aspects of environmental law, climate change law, environmental justice and human rights, as well as the legal framework conditions of international trade and sustainable development are presented. In doing so, the publication reflects legal and political options for regulating environmental interests in the African context, which are also relevant for international development cooperation and economic exchange. In addition, the work provides a solid basis for comparative environmental law",

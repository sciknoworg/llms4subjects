            "abstract": "This reprint is comprised of eleven articles that are screened by our hard-working peer reviewers. It mainly focuses on the recent advances in electric motors and drives, to adapt to the ongoing trends of electrification in both transportation and industry. New structural motors, such as the axial flux machine and the multi-phase machine, are introduced because of their enhanced reliability for use in next-generation electrified transportation. Special attention is also given to the micro PM motor, which has a broad use in many areas. In addition, advanced control techniques, such as position sensorless control and fault-tolerant control, are also incorporated to fulfill the demand for safe crucial applications, and the modeling of the bearing voltage and a line-start permanent magnet motor can be of particular interest to the industrial sectors. Through this reprint, we hope to provide a new perspective for the readers to manage their encountered problems, as well as stimulate innovative ideas for the electrified transportation of the next generation",

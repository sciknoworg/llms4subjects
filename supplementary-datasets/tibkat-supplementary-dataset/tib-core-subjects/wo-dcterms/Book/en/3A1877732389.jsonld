            "abstract": "Major casting processing advancements have been made in experimental and simulation areas. Newly developed advanced casting technologies allow foundry researchers to explore detailed phenomena associated with new casting process parameters helping to produce defect-free castings with good quality. Moreover, increased computational power allows foundry technologists to simulate advanced casting processes to reduce casting defects. In view of rapid expansion of knowledge and capability in the exciting field of casting technology, it is possible to develop new casting techniques. This book is intended to discuss many casting processing technologies. It is devoted to advanced casting processing technologies like ductile casting production and thermal analysis, casting of metal matrix composites by vortex stir casting technique, aluminum DC casting, evaporative casting process, and so on. This book entitled Advanced Casting Technologies has been organized into seven chapters and categorized into four sections. Section 1 discusses the production of ductile iron casting and thermal analysis. Section 2 depicts aluminum casting. Section 3 describes the casting manufacturing aspects of functionally graded materials and evaporative casting process. Section 4 explains about the vortex stir casting technique to process metal matrix composite castings. All the chapters discussed in detail the processing steps, process parameters involved in the individual casting technique, and also its applications. The goal of the book is to provide details on the recent casting technologies",

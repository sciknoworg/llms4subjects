            "abstract": "\"Transportation-related challenges exist all over the world, with all countries struggling to develop efficient, effective and user-friendly transportation systems. Today, policy agencies and financing institutions are keen to invest heavily for a potentially good transport systems, as good mobility is pertinent to social growth and a sustainable environment. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become a global area of growth in recent times because of increasing demand for mobility, rampant urbanization, and depleting energy reserves. Existing conventional transport infrastructure fails to meet the ever-increasing demand; building additional transportation infrastructure is cumbersome, as it is time-consuming and capital-intensive and available land space is very limited. Therefore, there is a pressing need for innovative and locally relevant systems that can be built rapidly with less investment by leveraging advances in technology. Good ITS enable informed decision-making for all stakeholders. This book presents the ingredients of good ITS, not from a technology perspective, but from a business administration, management, and policy perspective. The emphasis is on practice-oriented, impactful and context relevant systems. Short, real-life case studies are presented for each topic, to keep the discerning transportation enthusiast engaged.\"--",

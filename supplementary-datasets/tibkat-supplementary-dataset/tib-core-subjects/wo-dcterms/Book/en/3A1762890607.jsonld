            "abstract": "Computers and mobile technologies have become widely adopted as sought-after tools in the field of education. The prevalence of technology in early childhood education (ECE) is increasing, and teachers, both pre-service and in-service, are using best practices to integrate tools effectively to improve teaching and learning within the field. This includes settings such as childcare centers, family childcare, and community programs that have both educators and administrators adapting to the use of technology. Therefore, it has become critical to research and explore the best practices of technology integration and successful strategies to improve the use of technology in ECE.The Handbook of Research on Empowering Early Childhood Educators With Technology examines best practices that focus specifically on those that facilitate the development of competencies in teaching young children (birth to age 8) and technology integration. The chapters include information on the foundations of technology in early childhood education, content-specific technology applications, developmentally appropriate practices (DAP) for learners using technology, and how to meet diverse learner needs with technology. The target audience for this book is early childhood professionals, teacher educators, pre- and in-service teachers in early childhood settings, faculty and researchers in the field of education, instructional technologists, childcare and elementary school administrators, early education policy organizations, and advocacy groups that are interested in the best practices and successful strategies for implementing technology in ECE",

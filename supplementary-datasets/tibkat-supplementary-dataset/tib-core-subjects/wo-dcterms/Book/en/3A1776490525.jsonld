            "abstract": [
                "\"Judgment and Leadership presents original thinking and addresses age-old concerns regarding the relationship between judgment and leadership. These two concepts are inseparable. Judgment guides every action that a leader takes and underlies every thought, emotion, or justification that leaders form. This volume extends the study of judgment and leadership across disciplinary and conceptual boundaries. For the first time, the most original and influential thinkers on judgment and leadership are brought together in a single volume and they represent a diverse set of disciplines, including critical studies, psychology, political theory, international policy, adult learning theory, management and organizational studies, philosophy, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience. The result is an engaging look at one of the most important issues facing organizations, politics, and society: leaders and their judgment. The book describes the challenges and opportunities that leaders face when confronted with political, social, and business challenges and offers an insightful and comprehensive review of leadership and its role in crisis. The authors explore how a leader's actions and judgments are shaped by their experiences. It is a highly accessible account of how leaders learn and practice judgment and a guide for leaders faced with intense and challenging problems Scholars studying leadership, judgment, decision making, critical thinking, or problem solving seeking the latest original thinking on the topic of leadership and judgment as well as educators seeking to develop their students' knowledge about judgment from a multi-disciplinary perspective will find this volume an invaluable resource as will leadership trainers, educators, coaches, and human resource professionals seeking to improve and develop leaders\"--",

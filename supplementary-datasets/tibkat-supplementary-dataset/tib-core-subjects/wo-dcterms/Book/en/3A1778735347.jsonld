            "abstract": "The education industry has obviously been influenced by the Internet revolution. Teaching and learning methods have changed significantly since the coming of the Web and it is very likely they will keep evolving many years to come thanks to it. A good example of this changing reality is the spectacular development of e-Learning. In a more particular way, the Web 2.0 has offered to the teaching industry a set of tools and practices that are modifying the learning systems and knowledge transmission methods. Teachers and students can use these tools in a variety of ways aimed to the general purpose of promoting collaborative work. The editor would like to thank the authors, who have committed so much effort to the publication of this work. She is sure that this volume will certainly be of great help for students, teachers and researchers. This was, at least, the main aim of the authors",

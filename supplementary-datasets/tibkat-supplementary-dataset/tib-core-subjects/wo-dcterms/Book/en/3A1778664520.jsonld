            "abstract": "In 1537, Nicol\u00f2 Tartaglia (1500\u20131557), a mathematician from Brescia, published \"Nova scientia.\" It was this work that led to the foundation of the modern science of ballistics. Tartaglia\u2019s intention was to create a purely mathematical science based on axioms, which was fundamental to the entire subject of mechanics, starting with a limited number of principles and arriving at a series of propositions through a rigid procedure of deduction. Nevertheless, as Tartaglia himself states, his motive was fundamentally practical and connected to the activities of the sixteenth-century bombardier. A new edition of Nicol\u00f2 Tartaglia\u2019s \"Nova scientia,\" based on the 1558 print run of the second enlarged edition (1550), shows how the emergence of theoretical ballistics was a consequence of the technological innovations that took place in the frame of the practice of iron casting at the turn from the fifteenth to the sixteenth century",

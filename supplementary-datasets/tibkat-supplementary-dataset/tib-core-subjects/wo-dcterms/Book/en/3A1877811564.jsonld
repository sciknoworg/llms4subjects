                "Recent efforts to solve the problems of education\u2014created by neoliberalism in and out of higher education\u2014have centred on the use of technology that promises efficiency, progress tracking, and automation. The editors of this volume argue that using technology in this way reduces learning to a transaction. They ask administrators, instructors, and learning designers to reflect on our relationship with these tools and explore how to cultivate a pedagogy of care in an online environment. With an eye towards identifying different and better possibilities, this collection investigates previously under-examined concepts in the field of digital pedagogy such as shared learning and trust, critical consciousness, change, and hope",
                "\"The emerging field of critical digital pedagogy sits at the intersection of critical pedagogy and digital education and considers the opportunities, drawbacks, and complexities of today's online learning environment. With an eye towards identifying some of the future possibilities in online learning, this collection introduces new concepts to the field such as shared learning and trust, critical consciousness, change, and hope. A passionate reflection about the need to humanize the digital education environment, these essays are sure to spark alternative practices, propel research agendas, and foster future research.\"--"

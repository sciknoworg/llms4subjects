            "title": "Paris Bride : A Modernist Life",
            "abstract": "\"In July 1905, in Paris, a young  Anglo-French woman called Marie Wheeler became the bride of a Swiss  \u00e9migr\u00e9, Johannes Schad. Immediately after the wedding, Marie and  Johannes moved to London. And there they lived for nineteen years. In  1924, however, something happened to change their lives, and Marie, in  many respects, simply disappeared. Paris Bride is an exploration of  the lost life of Marie Schad, of whom little is known beyond a few legal  papers, a number of letters, some photographs, the diaries of a friend,  and her obituary. With so little else known of Marie\u2019s life, this book  seeks to read her back into existence by drawing on a host of  contemporaneous texts \u2014 largely modernist texts, by Virginia Woolf,  Franz Kafka, the Paris Surrealists, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Oscar Wilde,  Katherine Mansfield, and Walter Benjamin. All of the selected authors  are connected with Marie through some coincidence of time, place, or  theme. In an attempt to do justice to Marie\u2019s in-visibility, or to her un-life, Paris Bride  takes as its guide Wilde\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe true function of  criticism is to see the object as in itself it really is not.\u201d In other  words, this book seeks to evade the positivist or realist assumptions of  conventional literary criticism, and instead pursue a post-critical  method with its sources and texts. Paris Bride is not confined  to academic discourse but instead draws on a range of literary genres  and devices that are more in sympathy with the non-realist character of  modernism itself \u2014 devices such as fragmentation, fl\u00e2nerie, textual  collage, stream of consciousness, imagism, perspectivism, dream-text,  the absurd, etc. Ultimately, Paris Bride is a modernistic experiment in life-writing.\"",

                "\"Games, Simulations and Playful Learning in Business Education takes a fresh, insightful look at original and innovative ways of incorporating games, simulations and play to enhance the quality of higher education learning and assessment across business and law disciplines. Chapters cover wide-ranging business areas such as marketing, accounting and strategy and include practical advice, tips and thoughts on how to strengthen existing learning techniques to include a fun element. Contributors examine the core achievements that can be gained from playing games and simulations and how these can be adapted to learning within the business environment using a variety of techniques such as remote online learning, creating a digital game application and taking part in simulations that teach life skills for employability. The book also highlights the value and importance of skill learning through games alongside traditional methods to provide a more pleasurable learning experience. Examining all aspects of teaching and education, this book will be an invaluable resource for academics in business and law schools, based in the UK and internationally\"--",

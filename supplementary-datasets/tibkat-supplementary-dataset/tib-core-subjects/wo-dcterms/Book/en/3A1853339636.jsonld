            "abstract": "Given the current growth in global challenges, the need for smart agriculture practices and effective strategies is emerging as an imminent issue at a planetary scale. Agriculture 4.0 involves a large variety of mobile apps, web applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and platforms, drones, robots, and smart machinery for precision agriculture. The expansion of cloud technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and big data collection are setting the stage for Agriculture 5.0. Agriculture science and natural sciences are further promoting this trend with the development of leading-edge scientific models and platforms, including stochastic, process-based, and data-driven machine learning modeling. This Special Issue covers the most recent and up-to-date progress in all aspects of internet and computer software applications in agriculture, focusing on the development of web applications and mobile apps, smart IoT devices and platforms, AI, ML and DL solutions in precision agriculture for detection, recognition, classification, monitoring, cultivation, harvesting, and marketing; development of cloud technologies for smart agriculture; computer and machine vision methods and applications for drones and smart machinery, and sensors for field operations; diagnostics and data collection; big data science; scientific process-based and stochastic modeling; and machine learning modeling for agriculture, agroecosystems and natural ecosystems. The research in this Special Issue will contribute to the promotion of modern agriculture practices in the current climate and in the future",

                "\u201cRobert Busby\u2019s timely book is a welcome contribution to the growing literature on American political scandals. Using a case study approach to evaluate the changing nature and impact of scandals, Busby covers a wide range of events drawn from revelations about recent presidents, members of the U.S. Congress, and state governors. In doing so, he provides an accessible framework for the study of scandal and scandal management in the American political context.\u201d - Professor Richard Barberio, State University of New York College at Oneonta, USA \u201cJames Madison wrote: \u201cIf Men were angels, no government would be necessary.\u201d Since men are not angels, those who govern will sometimes fall short of angelic conduct. Thankfully, Robert Busby brings careful attention to American political scandals as a shaper of public opinion and driver of political behaviour. Selecting expository case studies, Busby explains our evolving understanding of political scandals and their place in modern politicking. Incisive, thorough, and engaging, this book is perfect for social science students at all levels.\u201d - Professor Alison Dagnes, Shippensburg University, USA This book examines how scandal allegations have been managed in the contemporary era in the United States and how understandings of the impact of scandal on political credibility have changed over time. It incorporates prominent scandals, at both federal and state level, in which sudden and unexpected revelations created an uncertain political environment. The primary focus is on sex scandals and how damage limitation strategies have been utilized in order to try to limit and accommodate a demise in political standing. The book considers how damage limitation strategies were utilized, the core components of each, and their impact on the political standing of the individuals involved. Rather than marking the end of a political journey, scandal increasingly appears to be an issue that can be perceived as a temporary impediment in a political career. Robert Busby is Senior Lecturer in Politics at the Department of History and Politics at Liverpool Hope University, UK.",

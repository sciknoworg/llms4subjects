            "title": "Tacitus, Annals, 15.20-23, 33-45 : Latin Text, Study Aids with Vocabulary, and Commentary",
            "abstract": "The emperor Nero is etched into the Western imagination as one of ancient Rome\u2019s most infamous villains, and Tacitus\u2019 Annals have played a central role in shaping the mainstream historiographical understanding of this flamboyant autocrat. This section of the text plunges us straight into the moral cesspool that Rome had apparently become in the later years of Nero\u2019s reign, chronicling the emperor\u2019s fledgling stage career including his plans for a grand tour of Greece; his participation in a city-wide orgy climaxing in his publicly consummated \u2018marriage\u2019 to his toy boy Pythagoras; the great fire of AD 64, during which large parts of central Rome went up in flames; and the rising of Nero\u2019s \u2018grotesque\u2019 new palace, the so-called \u2018Golden House\u2019, from the ashes of the city. This building project stoked the rumours that the emperor himself was behind the conflagration, and Tacitus goes on to present us with Nero\u2019s gruesome efforts to quell these mutterings by scapegoating and executing members of an unpopular new cult then starting to spread through the Roman empire: Christianity. All this contrasts starkly with four chapters focusing on one of Nero\u2019s most principled opponents, the Stoic senator Thrasea Paetus, an audacious figure of moral fibre, who courageously refuses to bend to the forces of imperial corruption and hypocrisy. This course book offers a portion of the original Latin text, study aids with vocabulary, and a commentary. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, Owen\u2019s and Gildenhard\u2019s incisive commentary will be of particular interest to students of Latin at both A2 and undergraduate level. It extends beyond detailed linguistic analysis and historical background to encourage critical engagement with Tacitus\u2019 prose and discussion of the most recent scholarly thought",

            "abstract": "The report is organized in four chapters. Chapter1 describes trends in growth, productivity, demography, employment, and living standards to inform the analysis of labor supply and labor demand carried out in the chapters that follow. The chapter starts by depicting aggregate trends in economic growth and living standards of the Tunisian population, the drivers of growth (e.g. remittances and migration, FDI, exchange rate, productivity, et cetera), and broad structural changes in terms of job creation and labor productivity growth. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the composition of the labor market and how it has changed over time, including demographics and labor force participation, employment and employment composition in terms of type of job, industrial sector, occupation both at the aggregate level and for different population groups based on gender, age, educational level, and geographical location. It turns the spotlight on two groups that face particular difficulties in accessing the labor market, namely women and youth, and advances hypotheses regarding key barriers to their engagement in the labor market. Chapter 3 shifts the focus to one of the most relevant dimensions that characterize the Tunisian labor market, namely the distinction between the public sector, formal and informal employment. The chapter investigates how individual characteristics are correlated with the probability of working in different types of employment; it provides an overview of recent trends in wages and of conditional wage gaps along a number of dimensions (men/women, public/private, formal/informal employment); and it illustrates how wage workers with different characteristics, in particular different educational endowments, benefit from the labor market. Finally, building on the findings of Chapter 1, Chapter 4 examines recent trends in the patterns of structural and spatial transformation along the employment and firm dimension. It provides an overview of the firm landscape in terms of size, industrial sector, geographical area as well as recent trends in firms' performance, dynamics, labor decisions and capital investments, as well as constraints and opportunities firms face",

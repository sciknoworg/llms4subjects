                "'Sandra Fielden and Marilyn Davidson, already well known for their contributions to gender issues in management, have brought together an absorbing collection of articles that serve to enhance our understanding of a complex area within organisation studies ... this particular Handbook is not a mere glossary. The editors provide a forum for scholarly works in a specialised area of small business and entrepreneurship research. And the International Handbook of Women and Small Business Entrepreneurship provides a rich resource - collectively, the papers serve to summarise and re-examine much of the relevant research to date ... an accessible book that follows a logical and coherent pattern ... the range of this book is significant, and the accomplishment considerable ... the International Handbook of Women and Small Business Entrepreneurship is a serious contribution to a niche area of entrepreneurship scholarship.

It may also be put to good use by women in management and entrepreneurship as well as policymakers and small service providers, given its high empirical content, supported by a sound empirical framework, which deals with real-life issues for women who wish to start up and manage their ..."

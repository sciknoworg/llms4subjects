This book entitled Indonesia Post-Pandemic Recovery Outlook: Social Perspectives explores social issues and topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic and discusses post-pandemic recovery efforts in Indonesia. Comprising of 15 chapters, this book is divided into three parts. The first part, Indonesia and COVID-19 recovery: an international political economy lens, focuses on Indonesia's role in responding to international issues and the global political economy during the pandemic and post-pandemic period. Second, Indonesia and COVID-19 recovery: socio-cultural perspectives, discusses the impact of the pandemic, government policies, and activism from marginalized and vulnerable social groups, including people in urban slum areas, women, migrant workers, persons with disabilities, and traditional arts workers. The last part, Indonesia and COVID-19 recovery: insight for future education, explores the future of education in post-pandemic Indonesia with all aspects that need to be considered, including access to technology, the importance of digital literacy, and innovation regarding methods and the potential of metaverse education in emergency situations. We hope that this book can be a valuable reference for stakeholders, policymakers, as well as society to recover from the pandemic crisis and find better solutions to benefit future generations",

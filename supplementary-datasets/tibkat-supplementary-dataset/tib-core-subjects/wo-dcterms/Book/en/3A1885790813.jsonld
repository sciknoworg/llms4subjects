            "abstract": "Cassava is a staple crop in many nations due to its adaptability to a wide range of climates. It has expanded across tropical Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. Cassava, noted for its high carbohydrate content, is third in carbohydrate content after rice and maize. Cassava - Recent Updates on Food, Feed, and Industry is the second edition of our previous book, Cassava - Biology, Production, and Use. This new edition has four sections. The first section discusses the perspectives of several countries on cassava, including food security and the circular economy. Due to the importance of cassava in many countries, the second section examines recent biotechnological advances as well as soil management and modifications in the improvement of cassava. The third section discusses disease management and control of cassava plants. Due to its widespread use and industrial importance, cassava has been subjected to biological and technological intervention for processing into food, feed, and other industrial matter, which is covered in the final section. We hope that this book will help readers gain advanced knowledge about cassava and learn from experts in the field with multiple perspectives",

            "abstract": "In 1931 Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote his famous Remarks on Frazer\u2019s \u201cGolden Bough,\u201d published posthumously in 1967. At that time, anthropology and philosophy were in close contact\u2014continental thinkers drew heavily on anthropology\u2019s theoretical terms, like mana, taboo, and potlatch, in order to help them explore the limits of human belief and imagination.   Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks on ritual, magic, religion, belief, ceremony, and Frazer\u2019s own logical presuppositions are as lucid and thought-provoking now as they were in Wittgenstein\u2019s day. Anthropologists find themselves asking many of the same questions as Wittgenstein\u2014and in a reflection of that, this volume is fleshed out with a series of engagements with Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas by some of the world\u2019s leading anthropologists, including Veena Das, David Graeber, Wendy James, Heonik Kwon, Michael Lambek, Michael Puett, and Carlo Severi",

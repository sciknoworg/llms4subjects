            "abstract": "\"An Advanced Course in Probability and Stochastic Processes provides a modern and rigorous treatment of probability theory and stochastic processes at an upper undergraduate and graduate level. Starting with the foundations of measure theory, this book introduces the key concepts of probability theory in an accessible way, providing full proofs and extensive examples and illustrations. Fundamental stochastic processes such as Gaussian processes, Poisson random measures, L\u00e9vy processes, Markov processes, and It\u00f4 processes are presented and explored in considerable depth, showcasing their many interconnections. Special attention is paid to martingales and the Wiener process and their central role in the treatment of stochastic integrals and stochastic calculus. This book includes many exercises, designed to test and challenge the reader and expand their skillset. An Advanced Course in Probability and Stochastic Processes is meant for students and researchers who have a solid mathematical background and who have had prior exposure to elementary probability and stochastic processes\"--",

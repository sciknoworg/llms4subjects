            "abstract": "The monograph is devoted to the study of dynamic processes in technical systems for various technological purposes. A new approach and methodology is proposed for a systemic, synergistic approach, taking into account the influence of energy fields of physical and mechanical effects, transformation and inversion of types of energy action. Models and equations of motion of discrete and continuous dynamic systems, dispersed media in the spectrum of their processing are considered. Changes in the parameters of subsystems are revealed: working mediums, mechanical systems, the processes of their interaction are investigated on the basis of taking into account their stress-strain state. The processes of grinding, sorting, mixing, compaction of materials and media are considered. The intensification of physical and mechanical processes, methods and means of their creation was achieved by the systematization and complexity of approaches due to the joint consideration of the mutual influence of the internal properties of subsystems. The processes of material processing by superresonant, subresonant and multi-mode parameters are investigated. Methods for determining effective parameters and modes of their operation are proposed. The processes of grinding, sorting, mixing, compaction of the processing medium in the field of vibration load are described. As a result of the research carried out, new properties of the behavior of discrete-continuous systems under power load conditions are revealed. For the first time, the stresses and deformations of both working bodies and media were taken into account to create energy-saving vibration systems for various technological processes. The carried out scientific research makes it possible to obtain the laws of change in the state of dispersed media under the action of power loads by technical systems, new technological and design solutions were proposed",

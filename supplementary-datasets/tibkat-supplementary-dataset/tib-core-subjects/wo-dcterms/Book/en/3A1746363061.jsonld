                "A timely collection of studies about a highly topical issue, and one that is not likely to lose its salience any time soon. The authors have rich experience, both in the region and in academia, which helps shape their contributions in ways which are pragmatic, well informed and admirably focussed. \u2013 Kerry Brown, Professor of Chinese Studies and Director, Lau China Institute, King\u2019s College London This is a timely book on an important subject. The thoughtful insights shared by former policy makers and sharp academic analysts raise important questions on how relations between Europe and North East Asia will unfold. \u2013 Steve Tsang, Director, SOAS China Institute, SOAS University of London The EU\u2019s interest in and engagement with North East Asia has grown massively over the last three decades, the shaping and implementation of its policy influenced heavily by the UK and its historical links with East Asia. Brexit therefore raises questions about the future of this engagement and comes against a background of wider threats to the liberal world order, especially rising tensions between the USA and China. China and its neighbours are therefore watching with interest to see how the EU and the UK respond and manage their future relations with the region. This book goes beyond the traditional trade links to consider diplomatic and security perspectives, as well as wider issues such as the possible impact on educational and research links. It will be of interest to diplomats, scholars, and economists. Michael Reilly has 30 years of experience as a diplomat, most of it in East Asia or handling policy towards the region. His previous books include Towards an EU-Taiwan Investment Agreement (2017) and The Implications of Brexit for East Asia (co-edited with David W.F.Huang, 2018). Dr. Chun-Yi Lee is an Associate Professor in the School of Politics and International Relations (SPIR) at the University of Nottingham. Her current research project is China\u2019s New Normal: The Impact of China\u2019s Rise on the Global Political Economy."

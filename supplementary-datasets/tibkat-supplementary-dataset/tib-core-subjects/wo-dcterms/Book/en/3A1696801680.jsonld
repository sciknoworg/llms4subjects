            "abstract": "\"The development of international business and of globalization in every field of activity requires the interaction of individuals and groups with diverse cultural, religious, ethnic and social characteristics in different institutional contexts. Cross-cultural Challenges in International Management addresses the various difficulties that may impede smooth communication and cooperation of those involved in such interactions. It examines what types of resources are mobilized to overcome such difficulties. The cultural and societal challenges of international management must be considered at different levels, the one of strategy, which the first part of the book is devoted to, but also that of management and business practices, addressed in the third part of the book. Both strategic decisions and daily business practices, however, in the particularly fluctuating and incompletely defined international context, gain from being framed by ethical and corporate social responsibility, which the second part of this book is devoted to. Cross-cultural Challenges in International Management provides an analysis of specific situations revealing such cultural or societal challenges. Thus, the reader will benefit not only from advanced theoretical knowledge in the field, but also from practical applications in various professional context and various countries. Practitioners, students in various fields of social sciences, particularly in management, communication, international relations, and researchers will widely benefit from this book\"--",

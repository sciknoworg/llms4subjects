            "abstract": "This Special Issue focuses on the state-of-the-art results from the definition and design of filters for low- and high-frequency applications and systems. Different technologies and solutions are commonly adopted for filter definition, from electrical to electromechanical and mechanical solutions, from passive to active devices, and from hybrid to integrated designs. Aspects related to both theoretical and experimental research in filter design, CAD modeling and novel technologies and applications, as well as filter fabrication, characterization and testing, are covered. The proposed research articles deal with different topics as follows: Modeling, design and simulation of filters; Processes and fabrication technologies for filters; Automated characterization and test of filters; Voltage and current mode filters; Integrated and discrete filters; Passive and active filters; Variable filters, characterization and tunability",

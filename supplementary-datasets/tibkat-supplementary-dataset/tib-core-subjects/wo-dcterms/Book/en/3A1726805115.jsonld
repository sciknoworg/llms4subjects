What types of records document those events? Now think about Earth's history, specifically the past environmental or climatic conditions at times before recorded human history. What records might there be of such conditions? Make a list of your ideas. n assemblage of five major types of natural archives of Earth's environmental and climatic history. What common feature(s) do each of these paleoclimate archives share? an assemblage of 5 major types of natural records, or archives, of Earth's environmental and climatic history. Just like a diary or other historical document, the layers in these natural archives contain indirect evidence (i.e., proxies) about past conditions and events, recorded in a sequential order. The evidence is specific to a certain time period and may be general or very detailed, depending on the rate that information was recorded. The faster the rate at which the recorder grew (trees and corals), accumulated (snow and ice), or was deposited (sedimentary sequences), the more detailed the record is, and the higher its resolution. For example, a record in which an annual signal can observed has a very high resolution. In contrast, if the finest observable details are on the order of a million years, then that record would have a low resolution\"--",

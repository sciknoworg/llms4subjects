            "abstract": "The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome e Principe (STP) is the smallest independent island state in Africa, having gained independence in 1975, following the Seychelles. STP has a predominantly young population. However, as an island micro-state, the country faces many development problems specific to islands and small countries, such as weak governance capacity, the inability to provide basic services to the population, and a lack of adequate infrastructure (ports, electricity, airports). Additionally, high production and distribution costs of goods and services, including food products, exacerbate the poverty level of the population. The virtually nonexistent corporate structure and undiversified, highly dependent economy make the country vulnerable to exogenous shocks. To address these challenges, STP developed and adopted a Transition Strategy for the Blue Economy in December 2019. This strategy aims to establish the coherence of public policies linked to oceanic resources with the policies of other sectors, such as fisheries and aquaculture, tourism, and energy. The purpose of this paper is to consolidate the analysis of the three investment projects prioritized for inclusion in the National Investment Plan for the Blue Economy. While the report does not imply endorsement of these projects by the World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), its primary objective is to illuminate the drivers of cost and benefit associated with the priorities already identified by the government of Sao Tome e Principe",

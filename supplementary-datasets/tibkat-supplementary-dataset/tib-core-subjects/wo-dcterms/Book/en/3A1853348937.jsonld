            "abstract": "The rapid emergence of COVID-19 presented unprecedented challenges to the education sector. COVID-19 caused the full or partial closing of schools and universities, as well as the cancellation of face-to-face activities in most parts of the world. To conduct business as usual, many higher education providers have taken steps towards digital transformation, moving to online or hybrid learning and teaching delivery approaches. This reprint provides timely research on the impact of COVID-19 on education systems, including the lessons learned. It seeks to unite scholars, educators, policymakers and practitioners to collectively and critically identify, investigate and share the best practices that may lead to rethinking and reframing the way we deliver education in the future",

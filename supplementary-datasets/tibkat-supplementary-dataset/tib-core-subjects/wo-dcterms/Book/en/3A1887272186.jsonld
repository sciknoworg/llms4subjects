                "The book on advanced structured materials is designed to facilitate teaching and informal discussion in a supportive and friendly environment. The book provides a forum for postgraduate students to present their research results and train their presentation and discussion skills. Furthermore, it allows for extensive discussion of current research being conducted in the wider area of advanced structured materials. Doing so, it builds a wider postgraduate community and offers networking opportunities for early career researchers. In addition to focused lectures, the book provides specialized teaching/overview lectures from experienced senior academics. The 2022 Postgraduate Seminar entitled \u201cAdvanced Structured Materials: Development - Manufacturing - Characterization \u2013 Applications\u201d was held from February 28th till March 4th, 2022, in Malta. The book that presented postgraduate lectures had a strong focus on polymer mechanics, composite materials, and additive manufacturing."

            "title": "Advanced Plasma Spray Applications",
            "abstract": "Recently, plasma spray has been received a large number of attentions for various type of applications due to the nature of the plasma plume and deposition structure. The plasma gas generated by the arc, consists of free electrons, ionized atoms, some neutral atoms, and undissociated diatomic molecules. The temperature of the core of the plasma jet may exceed up to 30,000 K. Gas velocity in the plasma spray torch can be varied from subsonic to supersonic using converging-diverging nozzles. Heat transfer in the plasma jet is primarily the result of the recombination of the ions and re-association of atoms in diatomic gases on the powder surfaces and absorption of radiation. Taking advantages of the plasma plume atmosphere, plasma spray can be used for surface modification and treatment, especially for activation of polymer surfaces. I addition, plasma spray can be used to deposit nanostructures as well as advanced coating structures for new applications in wear and corrosion resistance. Some state-of-the-art studies of advanced applications of plasma spraying such as nanostructure coatings, surface modifications, biomaterial deposition, and anti wear and corrosion coatings are presented in this book",

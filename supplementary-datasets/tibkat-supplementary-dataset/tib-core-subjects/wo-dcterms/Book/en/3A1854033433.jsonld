                "The world\u2019s extant building stock accounts for a significant portion of worldwide energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, buildings and construction accounted for 36% of global final energy consumption and 37% of energy related CO2 emissions. The EU estimates that up to 75% of the EU\u2019s existing building stock has poor energy performance, 85\u201395% of which will still be in use in 2050. To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change will require a transformation of construction processes and deep renovation of the extant building stock. It is widely recognized that ICTs can play an important role in construction, renovation and maintenance as well as supporting the financing of deep renovation. Technologies such as sensors, big data analytics and machine learning, BIM, digital twinning, simulation, robots, cobots and UAVs, and additive manufacturing are transforming the deep renovation process, improving sustainability performance, and developing new services and markets. This open access book defines a deep renovation digital ecosystem for the 21st century, providing a state-of-the art review of current literature, suggesting avenues for new research, and offering perspectives from business, technology and industry domains.

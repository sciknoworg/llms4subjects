                "This edited book covers the latest trends to improve soil health. It provides an easy-to-understand information to the readers. This book acts as a reference book for various agronomists and research scholars working in the field of agriculture. This edited book covers advanced technologies and practices carried out worldwide to improve soil health. In the present scenario, it is very important to save soil health and replenish it in a sustainable manner from various anthropogenic hazards. As soil is the source to almost all lives on earth and it is duty, the scientific community is developing ways to disseminate and communicate the most recent advancements to restore its health. Content of the book is designed in such a way that it provides a compressive information to the readers to restore the soil health that will ultimately help to improve the health of microbes, animals as well as plants that thrive in the soil and ultimately the quality of life of human being. This book helps research scholars and teachers working in agriculture, horticulture, and environmental management by utilizing advances in microbiology and biotechnology. It is of interest to undergraduate and graduate students, teachers, researchers, environmentalists, agriculture and horticulture scientists, capacity builders, policy makers and all other stakeholders. .",

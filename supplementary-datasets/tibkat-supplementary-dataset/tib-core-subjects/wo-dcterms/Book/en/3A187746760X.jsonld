            "abstract": "This book is an indispensable guide for executives, programme leaders, and business owners on maximising value from automation and digital transformation. It provides a real-world journey map of automation, from RPA through to intelligent automation, with a focus on practical strategy and management principles intended to help seize the trillions of dollars that are still being left on the table by companies that have not yet made this leap.  Though grounded on the research and advisory work of the author team, this book offers clear eyed, easy to read advice for avoiding the 'transformation bog' where many organisations find themselves, struggling to maintain their strategy in an environment that feels increasingly dynamic and confusing. This book is not blinded by the brilliant new technology and hones in on what works and what distracts. It provides a total value of ownership framework for navigation and identifies seven core digital capabilities required for success.    Ultimately a book for realists rather than digital idealists, it will be a vital resource for professionals who must chart a course to verifiable business performance improvement through digital enterprise empowerment amid often conflicting priorities",

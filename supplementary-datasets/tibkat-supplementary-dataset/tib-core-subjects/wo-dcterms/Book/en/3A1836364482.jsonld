            "abstract": "\"\u2018Teacher for Justice is a major contribution to the history of the women\u2019s movement, working\u2011class activism and Australian political internationalism. But it is more than this. By focusing on the life of Lucy Woodcock \u2013 an unrecognised and under-researched figure \u2013 this book rewrites the history of twentieth-century Australia from the perspective of an activist who challenged conventions to fight for gender, race and class equality, exploring the complex and multi-layered intersections of these aspects. It explores Woodcock\u2019s personal relationships and the circles she mixed in and the friendships she forged, as well as the conventions she challenged as a single woman in possibly a same-sex relationship. The book makes a key contribution to the history of progressive education and the experience of women teachers. Above all, it charts the life of a transnational figure who made connections globally and, in particular, with refugees and with women in India and the Asian region. It is a detailed, thoroughly researched and richly textured history which places Woodcock within the context of the times in which she lived.\u2019 Joy Damousi, Professor of History, University of Melbourne \u2018Meet Lucy Woodcock, a complex, undaunted woman in a tough and changing world. From her role as a public school principal in Depression and wartime, to her union and feminist organising, to her transnational engagements for peace, this clear and thoughtful book brings to life forgotten forms of activism. It\u2019s the gripping story of how Lucy navigated the minefields of gender, class, race and coloniality to change her world.\u2019 Raewyn Connell, Professor Emerita, University of Sydney \u2018Just over a century ago, the last of the pupil-teachers, Lucy Woodcock, co-founded the NSW Teachers Federation. So many of the principles and traditions that underpin our union today can be traced back to the lifelong work of Lucy Woodcock. She fought for the industrial rights of teachers deep in the knowledge of the broader social and economic context in which she lived and worked. Too often the role of working-class women whose influence is profound is ignored. This biography installs Lucy Woodcock into her rightful place as pivotal player in the history of twentieth-century Australia.\u2019 Maurie Mulheron, President, NSW Teachers Federation \u2018A fascinating history of a fascinating woman: Lucy\u2019s interests were so broad and so modern \u2013 equal pay, racism, internationalism, Indigenous rights and anti-war struggles were all part of Lucy\u2019s world. She had a vision beyond nationalism, championed the cause of world peace when peace was being treated as a dirty word and saw women as global citizens. Lucy was one of the heroes of our disgracefully unfinished Equal Pay struggle.\u2019 Hon Dr Meredith Burgmann, anti-racism and peace activist, former President of the NSW Legislative Council\"",

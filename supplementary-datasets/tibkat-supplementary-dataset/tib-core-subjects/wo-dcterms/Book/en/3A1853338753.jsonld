            "title": "Advanced Hydrologic Modeling in Watershed Scales",
            "abstract": "Hydrologic modeling at the watershed scale is a key topic in the field of hydrology. The hydrological model is an important tool in understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on rainfall\u2013runoff processes, and especially on water resources for human beings in a changing environment. In the last two decades, with the development of satellite remote sensing and artificial intelligence, many new datasets and methods have been introduced into hydrological modeling.Hydrologic modeling at the watershed scale is an important and fundamental research field in hydrology. Therefore, we proposed a Special Issue entitled \"Advanced Hydrologic Modeling in Watershed Scales\" in Water to publish results regarding the recent progress in hydrological modeling at the watershed scale against global changes. Before the deadline for the submission of manuscripts to this Special Issue, we received many manuscripts regarding hydrological modeling at the watershed scale. In total, ten articles have been published in this Special Issue. Researchers interested in hydrological modeling and the impacts of environmental changes on water resources may be interested in this reprint",

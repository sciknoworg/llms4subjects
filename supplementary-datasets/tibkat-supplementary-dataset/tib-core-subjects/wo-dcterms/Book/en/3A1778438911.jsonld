Its primary areas of research interests include: Gene-environment interactions Environmental genomics and proteomics Environmental toxicology, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis Environmental epidemiology and disease control Health risk assessment and management Ecotoxicology, and ecological risk assessment and management Natural resources damage assessment Environmental chemistry and computational modeling Environmental policy and management Environmental engineering and biotechnology Emerging issues in environmental health and diseases Environmental education and public health To help celebrate the 15th anniversary, you are kindly invited to submit original articles, critical reviews, research notes, and short communications on any of the above-listed topics. Please also encourage any of our colleagues who may be interested to submit manuscripts.

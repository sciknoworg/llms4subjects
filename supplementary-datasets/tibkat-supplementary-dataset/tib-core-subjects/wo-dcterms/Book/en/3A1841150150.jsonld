            "abstract": "In a totally globalized world with a population estimated to reach 10 billion by the year 2100, according to the United Nations, food security and food safety are two of the main challenges facing humanity. Foodborne pathogens continue to cause many cases of infection in humans worldwide each year. Global trade today results in food produced in a specific region or industry being distributed globally, which can lead to a food-poisoning outbreak affecting people in different countries. The increase in antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains is another cause for concern. Detection and control of pathogens are therefore essential to prevent the occurrence of food-poisoning outbreaks and to reduce the prevalence of pathogens along the food production chain. Throughout the chapters of this book, the reader will have an overview of the main food pathogens and the problems they cause, as well as the main control measures and techniques for their rapid detection",

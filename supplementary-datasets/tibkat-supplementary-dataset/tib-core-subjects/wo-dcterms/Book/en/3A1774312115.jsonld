            "abstract": "This assessment of the implementation of the BCP by the BOT is part of the FSAP undertaken by the IMF and the World Bank. The assessment was performed October 25 through November 16, 2018 and is based on the regulatory and supervisory framework in place at the time of this visit. Compliance was measured against standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in 2012.1 Since the previous assessment, conducted in 2008, the BCP standards have been revised and reflect the international consensus for minimum standards based on global experience. The view is that supervision should be based on a process involving well-defined requirements, supervisory onsite and offsite determination of compliance with requirements and risk assessments, and a strong program of enforcement and corrective action and sanctions. The 2012 revision placed increased emphasis on corporate governance, on supervisors conducting reviews to determine compliance with regulatory requirements, and on thoroughly understanding the risk profile of banks and the banking system. The assessors appreciated the high quality of cooperation received from the authorities. The mission extends its thanks to the staff of the BOT for its excellent cooperation and hospitality. The BOT provided a comprehensive and detailed self-assessment and granted access to supervisory manuals, onsite inspection reports, monitoring reports, and risk assessments",

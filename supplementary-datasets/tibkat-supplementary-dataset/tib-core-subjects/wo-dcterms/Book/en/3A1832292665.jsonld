            "abstract": "Originally published in 1971. With Atat\u00fcrk's guiding reforms, Turkey underwent a sweeping modernization of the country's administration. More specifically, by adopting the Latin alphabet, secularizing the country's governance, and importing European laws and jurisprudence, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk effectively reformed the Republic of Turkey into a secular, modern nation-state. In doing so, he introduced a number of foreign policy commitments. Ferenc A. V\u00e1li examines the flexibility of Turkey's foreign commitments in light of the country's modernization; depending on the circumstance, Turkey's foreign policy has wavered between Western alliance and neutrality. Examining Turkey's foreign policy in the twentieth century, V\u00e1li provides historical background for Turkey's transition form an empire to a nation-state. V\u00e1li also assesses Turkey's relations with NATO, Western allies, Russia, the Baltic States, and the Middle East. For his research, V\u00e1li conducted interviews with officials of the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, political party leaders, academics, journalists, and members of diplomatic missions",

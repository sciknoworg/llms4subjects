            "abstract": "Swedish teachers\u2019 digital competence refers to aspects of teaching as well as teachers\u2019 work in a broader context. In this chapter, 19 Swedish teachers\u2019 digital competence is analyzed as infrastructures for teaching and working, thereby setting digital competence in the context of teachers\u2019 work in and out of the classroom. This chapter contributes to an understanding of how contextual factors of teachers\u2019 digital competence relate to infrastructures for teaching and working and illuminates how contributing to teachers\u2019 digital competence is both an individual and a collective responsibility. The analysis highlights the challenges that teachers face and suggests how these can be understood and conceptualized in relation to individual and structural levels of schooling, and to teaching and working infrastructures",

            "abstract": "Sigi J\u00f6ttkandt's The Nabokov Effect: Reading in the Endgame attends to the \u2018lettrocalamity\u2019 that occurs when literature and cinema collide in Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s work. J\u00f6ttkandt suspends the long-held critical investment in Nabokov\u2019s authorial control to focus on another principle of representational agency making incursions into his books. Tracing the subterranean network of cross-lingual puns, homophonies, and technical overflows of writing to a cinaesthetic signature system, J\u00f6ttkandt recasts the vexed question of Nabokov\u2019s relation to psychoanalysis. A pioneer of too-close reading, Nabokov offers himself, J\u00f6ttkandt argues, as the tipping point of perceptual and epistemological systems that are in the process of devouring themselves. The ensuing \u2018Nabokov effect\u2019 is both an assault on teleological models, and an opening onto other forms of reading and listening, which J\u00f6ttkandt argues was always latent in psychoanalysis. In this book, Nabokov emerges as the writer for humanity\u2019s endgame, architect of a post- interpretive complex that opens up broader questions concerning our ability to read him or, indeed any writer, today",

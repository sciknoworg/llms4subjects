            "abstract": "This book is a very provocative addition to the literature on pituitary diseases, it delivers lots of stimulating work and offers rich scientific material for readers in different disciplines. The book provides a detailed update on current diagnostic and therapeutic techniques useful in the management of pituitary diseases. Microsurgical surgery, medical treatment, and radiotherapy has been used in the last decades; however, the prediction of post-medical, postsurgical treatment, and post-radiotherapy treatment is still controversial. The book contents reflect the multidisciplinary approach needed for patients with pituitary diseases with contribution from neurosurgeons, endocrinologists, neurologists, radiologists, ophthalmologists, pathologists, and radiation oncologists. The book focuses on some pituitary diseases especially the most controversial subjects in the medical and surgical treatment such as dedicated surgical technique by huge pituitary adenoma, the management of celiac patients with growth failure, pituitary apoplexy, neuro ophthalmology findings in pituitary disease, and the immunohistochemical studies in pituitary adenomas, moreover there is a special chapter about transoral robotic surgery (TORS) with the da Vinci system",

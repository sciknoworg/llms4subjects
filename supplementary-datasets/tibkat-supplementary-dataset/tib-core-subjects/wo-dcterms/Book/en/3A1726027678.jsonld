                "This volume offers a collection of carefully selected, peer-reviewed papers presented at the BIOMAT 2019 International Symposium, which was held at the University of Szeged, Bolyai Institute and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Hungary, October 21st-25th, 2019. The topics covered in this volume include tumor and infection modeling; dynamics of co-infections; epidemic models on networks; aspects of blood circulation modeling; multidimensional modeling approach via time-frequency analysis and Edge Based Compartmental Model; and more. This book builds upon the tradition of the previous BIOMAT volumes to foster interdisciplinary research in mathematical biology for students, researchers, and professionals. Held every year since 2001, the BIOMAT International Symposium gathers together, in a single conference, researchers from Mathematics, Physics, Biology, and affine fields to promote the interdisciplinary exchange of results, ideas and techniques, promoting truly international cooperation for problem discussion. The 2019 edition of BIOMAT International Symposium received contributions by authors from 13 countries: Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, India, Italy, Russia, Senegal, Serbia, United Kingdom and the USA. Selected papers presented at the 2017 and 2018 editions of this Symposium were also published by Springer, in the volumes \"Trends in Biomathematics: Modeling, Optimization and Computational Problems\" (978-3-319-91091-8) and \"Trends in Biomathematics: Mathematical Modeling for Health, Harvesting, and Population Dynamics\" (978-3-030-23432-4)."

            "abstract": "Modern greenhouse technology has revolutionized the food supply chain scenario over the past 40 years. Closed-field cultivation by means of agri-cubes, plant factories, vertical farming structures, and roof-top solar greenhouses has become the backbone of sustainable agriculture for producing all-year-round fresh fruits and vegetables. This book is an attempt to explore several profound questions such as how digital technology and simulation models have saved energy in commercial greenhouses, and why growers prefer LPWAN sensors and IoT monitoring devices over the traditional timer-based controllers? How artificial intelligence is capable of performing microclimate prediction and control, and what considerations should be taken into account for implementing desiccant evaporative cooling systems? With case-study examples and field experiments, each chapter highlights some of the most recent solutions and adaptation strategies toward improving the efficiency and sustainability of closed-field crop production systems",

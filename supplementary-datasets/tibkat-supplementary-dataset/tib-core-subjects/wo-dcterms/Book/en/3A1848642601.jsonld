            "abstract": "\"This handbook provides an insight into the advancements in surface engineering methods, addressing the microstructural features, properties, mechanisms of surface degradation failures, and tribological performance of the components. Emphasis is on laser cladding methods because by using laser cladding a new class of materials like nano-composites, nano-tubes, and smart materials can be easily deposited. Handbook of Laser-Based Sustainable Surface Modification and Manufacturing Techniques discusses the main mechanism behind the surface degradation of structural components in strenuous environments. It highlights the capacity of laser cladding to operate on a wide range of substrate materials and shapes as well as presents how laser cladding can offer new possibilities in the reconditioning of components and how in many cases, these approaches are the only solution for economical efficiency. The handbook illustrates how if the type of power of the laser, laser optics, and the parameters of the process are efficiently selected, the number of applications of laser cladding can be large. The standard methods of testing used for various types of biomedical devices and tools, as well as the advantages of combining laser cladding with simultaneous induction heating, are described as well within this handbook. Features: Discusses the main mechanism behind the surface degradation of structural components in strenuous environments Highlights the capacity of laser cladding needed to operate on a wide range of substrate materials and shapes Presents how laser cladding can offer new possibilities in the reconditioning of components and how in many cases, these approaches are the only possible solution and are economically efficient Illustrates how if the type and power of the laser, laser optics, and the parameters of the process are efficiently selected, the number of applications of laser cladding can be large Offers the standard methods of testing used for various types of biomedical devices and tools Goes over the advantages of combining laser cladding with simultaneous induction heating The technical outcomes of these surface engineering methods are helpful for academics, students, and professionals who are working in this field as this enlightens their understanding of the performance of these latest processes. The audience is broad and multidisciplinary\"--",

            "abstract": "\"Quantum field theory is the mathematical and conceptual framework that describes the physics of the very small, including subatomic particles and quasiparticles. It is used to address a range of problems across subfields, from high-energy physics and gravitation to statistical physics and condensed matter physics. Despite the breadth of its applications, however, the teaching of quantum field theory has historically been strongly oriented toward high-energy physics students, while others-particularly in condensed matter and statistical physics-are typically taught in a separate course, or take an alternate sequence in many-body and statistical physics. Author Eduardo Fradkin strongly believes that this separation is both artificial and detrimental to all groups' understanding of quantum field theory. This textbook, developed from a graduate course Fradkin has taught for decades at the University of Illinois, offers a new, \"multicultural\" approach to the subject that seeks to remedy this fragmentation. It covers both basic techniques and topics at the frontiers of current research, and integrates modern concepts and examples from high-energy, statistical, and condensed-matter physics alike. Extensive problem sets further illustrate applications across a range of subfields. The book will be suitable for students across physical subdisciplines who have mastered graduate-level quantum mechanics, and will be a useful reference for researchers\"--",

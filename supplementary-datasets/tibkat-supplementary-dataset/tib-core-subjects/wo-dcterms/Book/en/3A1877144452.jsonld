                "\u201cThis book of essays by leading scholars on the Armenian Genocide is a fitting tribute to Taner Ak\u00e7am and a major contribution to the field he has helped to define. Embodying the virtues of his pathbreaking work, they present both micro- and macro-perspectives on one of the twentieth-century\u2019s defining events.\u201d \u2014A. Dirk Moses, City College of New York, USA \u201cThis book is a major contribution to the field of Armenian Genocide Studies. The interdisciplinary aspect of the book - that ranges from gender violence, humanitarianism, the role of cinema, and memoirs, to the economic dimension of the genocide, activism in genocide studies, and historiographic analysis - provides new perspectives on the Armenian Genocide and its repercussions. The book is a must read to all those interested in understanding the different facets of the Armenian Genocide.\u201d \u2014Bedross Der Matossian, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA This open access book brings together contributions from an internationally diverse group of scholars to celebrate Taner Ak\u00e7am\u2019s role as the first Turkish intellectual to publicly recognize the Armenian Genocide. As a researcher, lecturer, and mentor to a new generation of scholars, Ak\u00e7am has led the effort to utilize previously unknown, ignored, or under-studied sources, whether in Turkish, Armenian, German, or other languages, thus immeasurably expanding and deepening the scholarly project of documenting and analyzing the Armenian Genocide.

            "title": "Sappho: Fragments",
            "abstract": "In Sappho, Jonathan Goldberg takes as his model the fragmentary state in which this sublime poet\u2019s writing survives, a set of compositional and theoretical resources for living and thinking in more fully erotic ways in the present and the future. This book thus offers fragmentary commentary on disparate (Sapphic) works, such as the comics of Alison Bechdel, the paintings and cartoons of Leonardo da Vinci, Robert Reid-Pharr\u2019s \u201cLiving as a Lesbian,\u201d Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s Histoire de Sapho, John Donne\u2019s \u201cSapho to Philaenis,\u201d Todd Haynes and Patricia Highsmith\u2019s Carol, Virginia Woolf\u2019s Orlando, writings by Willa Cather, and the paintings and writings of Simeon Solomon, among other works. Goldberg challenges readers to imagine and experience what Sarah Orne Jewett named the \u201ccountry of our friendship,\u201d a love both exceedingly strange and compellingly familiar.  Just as Sappho\u2019s coinage \u201cbitter-sweet\u201d describes eros as inextricably contradictory \u2014 two things at once, one thing after another, each interrupting, complicating, each other \u2014 the juxtapositions in this book mean to continually call into question categories of identity and identification in the wake of a quintessential woman writer from Lesbos. Over and over again, Goldberg\u2019s Sappho: ]fragments inquires into how race, sexuality, and gender cross each other. The theoretical genius of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick presides over this set of meditations and mediations on likeness and desire. Rather than homogenizing its many subjects, it invites the reader to explore and inhabit new transits within and through what Audre Lorde called \u201cthe very house of difference.\u201d",

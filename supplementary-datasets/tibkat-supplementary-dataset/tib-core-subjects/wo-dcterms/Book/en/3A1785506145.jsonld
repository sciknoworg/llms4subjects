            "abstract": "\"The need for both intrinsic and extrinsic fiber-optic sensor technologies continues to grow. To meet the demands of this fast-expanding applications-driven market, this book, Fiber-Optic-Based Sensing Systems, presents both the latest advances in fiber-optic sensor technology, such as applications of photonic crystal fibers to fiber optic gyroscopes and recent application opportunities, including the use of fiber optic sensors as a minimally invasive medical treatment and in structural health monitoring. The book highlights the development of fiber optic sensors while also providing an overview of current methods for the construction of high-speed and high-capacity fiber-optic systems. It provides a thorough presentation of novel fiber-optic based sensing systems with state-of-the-art signal processing of the interferometric signals. Key features: Highlights the uniqueness of the fiber-optics sensors Presents state-of-the-art technology in optical fiber sensors Discusses a variety of fiber-optic topologies Considers different detection techniques Gives special attention to distributed fiber-optic sensing systems Dealing with the applicative aspects of using optical fibers as the sensing medium as well as the medium for transmitting the corresponding optical signals to the receiving unit, the book discusses the basic optical phenomena with their main emphasis on applying the optical knowledge for solving real-life engineering problems. Basic tools and concepts are presented in the earlier chapters, which are then developed in more detail in the later chapters. The book is organized in seven chapters covering a broad range of fiber-optical sensing phenomena. Written for undergraduate and graduate students who want to broaden their knowledge of fiber-optic sensing system applications to the real-life engineering problems, the volume is also valuable for engineers who want to acquire the basic principles of optics, especially fiber-optics\"--",

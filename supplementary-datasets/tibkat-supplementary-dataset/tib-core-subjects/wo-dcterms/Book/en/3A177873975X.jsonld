            "abstract": "Within most disciplines, there are those who are recognized by their colleagues as being exceptionally competent practitioners. These individuals do their work in such a remarkable way as to become a model for others. This book is based on a study of the beliefs, actions, and interactions of a group of extraordinary oncology nurses\u2014the people their peers would choose to have care for them if they were diagnosed with cancer. Perry\u2019s weaving of interviewee\u2019s stories and her own field notes and poetry creates a very personal perspective on nursing that leaves the reader with a greater understanding of the experience, and rewards, of caring for others",

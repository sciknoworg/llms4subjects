            "title": "A closer look at fault-tolerant control",
            "abstract": "\"A Closer Look at Fault-Tolerant Control first presents the application of a fault tolerant control system on distillation processes, with automatic actuator faults containment capabilities and an atmospheric crude distillation unit. Following this, model-based fault-tolerant control and fault accommodation algorithms are presented for two challenging classes of distributed systems: a spatially distributed system that can be decomposed into interconnected subsystems, and a distributed parameter system where the system state is distributed over a continuous range of space. The authors present recent research on fault-tolerant control systems for unmanned aerial systems, particularly for multirotor-type vehicles commonly known as drones. An overview of tools for the analysis of the fundamental properties of an automated system is provided, allowing for any inherent redundancy in the controlled process to be utilised to maintain availability. Additionally, a reconfigurable fault-tolerant flight control system is proposed to combat sensor/actuator faults for autonomous underwater vehicles. The reconfigurable design and operation of complex systems is addressed, with emphasis on autonomous systems, building upon concepts of autonomy, incipient failure diagnosis and prognosis algorithms. The authors present a fault detection filter for induction motors speed as a class of nonlinear system in networked control systems subject to induced time delays. The multi-model approach for the modeling of induction motors is described using a set of linear models. In the concluding study, the construction of an induction motor is presented, and a review of induction motor failures is discussed\"--",

            "abstract": "This edited volume explores a variety of aspects of associative governance, providing detailed case studies of associations and associational governance in Scandinavia. Theoretically developing a concept and approach of associative governance, the book sheds light on a dynamic way of perceiving associative aspects of community and commercial life that has been hitherto underexplored and undertheorized. It shows how governance by associations may be conducted not only bottom\u2011up by self\u2011organized and voluntary participation, but also top\u2011down by authoritative incorporation through government, and \u2013 not least \u2013 in multifarious interstices in between. New section by exploring a vibrant panoply of dimensions of associative governance, empirically grounded in historical analyses of a wide range of organizational repertoires, the book may provide novel insights into the significant role of associative governance in Scandinavia over the past two centuries. Finally, it provides research\u2011based knowledge about how to maintain \u201cgood political and economic institutions\u201d in the future and a more holistic and dynamic approach to the literature on The Nordic model. The book will be of key interest to scholars and students of Nordic and Scandinavian studies, history, sociology, political science, marketing, social policy, organization theory, and public management.

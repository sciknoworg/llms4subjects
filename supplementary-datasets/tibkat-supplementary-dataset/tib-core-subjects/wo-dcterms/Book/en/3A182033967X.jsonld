                "\"Data collaboration is critical to closing societal gaps in data access and capabilities. Ironically, there is little evidence available about impactful data collaboratives, especially involving non-profits, making their data use challenging. This book fills a void by providing a unique understanding of the variables that matter. Anyone interested in using data for social good should read this book.\" \u2014Stefaan Verhulst, Co-Founder of The Govlab, New York University and Editor-in-Chief of Data & Policy \u201cThe non-profit needs to build data capability so it continues to develop innovative services and report on high impact outcomes. Through practical examples and advice from data projects, this open access book will help make this happen.\u201d \u2014Dr Catherine Brown OAM, CEO, Lord Mayors Charitable Foundation, Melbourne, Australia This open access book provides practical guidance for non-profits and community sector organisations about how to get started with data analytics projects using their own organisations\u2019 datasets and open public data. The book shares best practices on collaborative social data projects and methodology. For researchers, the work offers a playbook for partnering with community organisations in data projects for public good and gives worked examples of projects of various sizes and complexity.

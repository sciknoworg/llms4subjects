                "Unidentified phenomena in space, in the Earth's atmosphere, and in waters are too important to leave their exploration to the military and scientific laypersons. Their proper scientific study is important for a variety of reasons; in particular, scientists and the public at large need to know the basic facts, to be informed about the way evidence is recorded, and to understand the difference been reliable evidence and fiction, as well as between plausible explanations and fantasy. With this objective, the book surveys the history of UFO observations, the variety of recorded phenomena, and recounts the efforts of investigative commissions and their published findings. Although wild rumors are demystified in the process, this is not an exercise in rumor-bashing. An open and at the same time critical mindset is the key. Many narratives and hypothesis appear implausible relative to our present state of knowledge; but this alone should not lead to their outright exclusion. Thus the author also pays attention to UFO sightings that have so far eluded explanation in terms of known physics or meteorology. Here the reader will encounter some of the more speculative but scientifically tenable proposals, for example, relating to sudden zigzag motion without apparent inertia or recognizable propulsion, yet always with a clear guide to their plausibility. Last but not least, the book outlines plans and suggestions for future research capable of revealing the existence and intentions of extraterrestrial intelligences, outer-space engineers, or technologies so far known only from science fiction."

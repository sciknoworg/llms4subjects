            "abstract": "For the elderly, the right to choose where and with whom to live takes on special significance: it is related to the overcoming of ageism, of which both paternalism and a segregationist and institutionalizing approach to old age are part. Nevertheless, so far, the multilevel politics concerning active and healthy aging, the right to independent living, the ageing in place and the transition to \"\"new\"\" models of welfare have not really been able to remedy the exclusion experienced by many older people socially and in the urban context. For this reason, the elderly\u2019s right to the (age-friendly) city is still, at least in part, not adequately guaranteed. The essays collected in this volume are the outcome of an interdisciplinary research focused primarily on the municipality of Ferrara (one of the Italian cities most affected by population aging) but have also a more general relevance. They aim at reflecting on the complex intertwining of the needs and rights of the elderly population and, in particular, on their right to lead a life of dignity and independence (also) within the urban context",

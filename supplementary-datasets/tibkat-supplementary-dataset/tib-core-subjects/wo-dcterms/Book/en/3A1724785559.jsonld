                "\"This book focuses on the chemistry and applications of flame retardants for polymers and other materials. It starts with a description and types of flame retardants, as well as their properties and chemical structures, to include chlorine- and bromine-containing flame retardants, phosphorus-based flame retardants, nitrogen-based flame retardants, and silicones. Inorganic materials that serve as flame retardants, such as boron-based additives, graphenes, and others are discussed in detail. In addition, the following subjects are discussed in detail:  Flame retardant polymers  The mechanisms of flame retardants, such as flame cooling, synergetic effects, degradation of flame retardants, and others  Other flame retardant compositions, such as dripping inhibitors and smoke suppressants  Testing methods for flame retardants, international standards, human health hazards, such as smoke toxicity and problems with wastes  Synthesis and fabrication methods, as well as recycling methods  The application of flame retardants to the coating material using 3D printing, reactive coating, and bulk addition methods  Non-burning comonomers, foams, nanocomposites and bio-based materials  Flame retardants with other textiles, such as wool and electrical applications such as batteries\"--"

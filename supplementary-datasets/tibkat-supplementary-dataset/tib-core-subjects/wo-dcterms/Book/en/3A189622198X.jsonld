            "abstract": "Build super fast and super secure microservices with the gRPC high-performance messaging protocol and powerful Go language. In gRPC Microservices in Go you'll learn: Designing and implementing resilient microservice architecture Testing microservices Deploying microservices to the cloud with modern orchestration tools Monitoring and overseeing microservices The powerful gRPC Remote Procedure Call framework delivers superior speed and security over protocols like REST. When paired with Golang's low-level efficiency and flexibility, gRPC and Go become a killer combination for latency-sensitive microservices applications. gRPC Microservices in Go shows you how to utilize these powerful tools to build production-grade microservices. You'll learn to develop microservice inter-service communication patterns that are powered by gRPC, design backward compatible APIs, and apply hexagonal architecture to microservices. About the Technology Go is perfect for writing fast, reliable microservices code, but that's only half the story. You also need a communications framework like gRPC to connect your services and handle load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication. Together, Go and gRPC accelerate the development process and eliminate many of the challenges you face when building and deploying microservices. About the Book gRPC Microservices in Go teaches you how to build production-ready microservices using Go and gRPC. In it, you'll learn to create efficient APIs in Go, use gRPC for network communication, and deploy on cloud and Kubernetes. Helpful examples, including a complete eCommerce web app, make it easy to grasp each concept. You'll also get an inside look at testing, deployment, and efficient DevOps practices for microservices. What's Inside Designing and implementing resilient microservice architecture Testing microservices Cloud deploying microservices with orchestration tools Monitoring and overseeing microservices About the Reader For software developers who know the basics of Go. About the Author H\u00a9\u01a1seyin Babal has been using Go in production since 2017 to build and maintain SaaS platforms. Quotes A great book for gRPC microservices development, and even better if you plan on using Go to build them. - Jonathan Reeves, Wolfjaw Studios Insightful and comprehensive. A step-by-step walk-through with clear examples. - Jeelani Shaik, Huntington Bank A wealth of practical suggestions for real-world applications. - Marco Massenzio, Cruise Interprocess communication masterfully revisited. - Mikael Dautrey, ISITIX Uncover the power of gRPC for building secure and efficient microservices. - Andrea Monacchi, CHILI.",

                "\"The book\u2019s original contribution to contemporary conceptual history \u2013 particularly in the field of political and sociological intellectual histories \u2013 consists of mapping of the concept of articulation as an Ariadne\u2019s thread that can shed light on conceptualisations of society and their shifts. As the author of the book rightly emphasizes, the metaphors that theorists use to describe society are not only words but concrete attempts to grasp the social as well as normative approaches that indicate how to best organize it. That is, societal metaphors are not neutral. The topic is of enormous importance for sociological and political analysts in particular\". \u2014 Dr Sara R. Farris, Associate Professor, Department of Sociology, Goldsmiths College, University of London This open access book is the first book that attempts to treat the notion of articulation as an important concept to be added to the lexicon of communication studies and social science. It constitutes the first comprehensive and systematic discussion of \u2018articulation\u2019 in English, providing an introduction of its usages and what has occurred on its \u2018travels\u2019 from one theoretical realm to another in political philosophy, structural linguistics, new economic anthropology, cultural studies and post-Marxist discourse theory. The proposed research takes a relational approach to society and social action in a way that recognises their relative autonomy. It entails an introduction of the \u2018discursive turn\u2019 in the imagery of society and social change, thereby proving that the relational concept of articulation/Gliederung has potential to consider society as both a structured, complex whole and a product of human interaction.

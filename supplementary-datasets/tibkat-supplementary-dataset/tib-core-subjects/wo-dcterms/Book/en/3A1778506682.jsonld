            "abstract": "\"In this book Ernesto Screpanti provides a rigorous examination of Marx\u2019s theory of exploitation, one of the cornerstones of Marxist thought. With precision and clarity, he identifies the holes in traditional readings of Marx\u2019s theory before advancing his own original interpretation, drawing on contemporary philosophy and economic theory to provide a refreshingly interdisciplinary exegesis.  Screpanti\u2019s arguments are delivered with perspicuity and verve: this is a book that aims to spark a debate. He exposes ambiguities present in Marx\u2019s exposition of his own theory, especially when dealing with the employment contract and the notions of \u2018abstract labor\u2019 and \u2018labor value\u2019, and he argues that these ambiguities have given rise to misunderstandings in previous analyses of Marx\u2019s theory of exploitation. Screpanti\u2019s own interpretation is a meticulously argued counterpoint to these traditional interpretations.  Labour and Value is a significant contribution to the theory of economics, particularly Marxist economics. It will also be of great interest to scholars in other disciplines including sociology, political science, and moral and political philosophy. Screpanti\u2019s clear and engaging writing style will attract the interested general reader as well as the academic theorist",

Intended primarily for courses taken by students in fields such as Psychology, Education, Counseling, Nursing, and Social Work, this book presents a comprehensive, practical presentation of both the principles of behavior modification and guidelines for their application. This ninth edition of Behavior Modification: What It Is and How to Do It, like its predecessors, assumes no specific prior knowledge about psychology or behavior modification on the part of the reader. Those who want to know how to apply behavior modification to their everyday concerns\u2013from helping children learn life\u2019s necessary skills to solving some of their own personal behavior problems\u2013will find the text useful. Mainly, however, this book is addressed to two audiences: (a) students taking courses in behavior modification, applied behavior analysis, behavior therapy, the psychology of learning, and related areas; and (b) students and practitioners of various helping professions such as clinical psychology, counseling, education, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychiatric nursing, psychiatry, social work, speech therapy, and sport psychology who are concerned directly with enhancing various forms of behavioral development. As with previous editions, individuals preparing for Behavior Analysis Certification Exams will also find the text valuable. In this regard it is one of the texts recommended by the Behavior Analysis Certification Board\u00ae.\"",

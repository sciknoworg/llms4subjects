                "Learn the intricate workings of DAX and the mechanics that are necessary to solve advanced Power BI challenges. This book is all about DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), the formula language used in Power BI\u2014Microsoft\u2019s leading self-service business intelligence application\u2014and covers other products such as PowerPivot and SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular. You will learn how to leverage the advanced applications of DAX to solve complex tasks. Often a task seems complex due to a lack of understanding, or a misunderstanding of core principles, and how certain components interact with each other. The authors of this book use solutions and examples to teach you how to solve complex problems. They explain the intricate workings of important concepts such as Filter Context and Context Transition. You will learn how Power BI, through combining DAX building blocks (such as measures, table filtering, and data lineage), can yield extraordinary analytical power. Throughout Pro Dax with Power BI these building blocks are used to create and compose solutions for advanced DAX problems, so you can independently build solutions to your own complex problems, and gain valuable insight from your data. What You Will Learn Understand the intricate workings of DAX to solve advanced problems Deconstruct problems into manageable parts in order to create your own recipes Apply predefined solutions for addressing problems, and link back step-by-step to the mechanics of DAX, to know the foundation of this powerful query language Get fully on board with DAX, a new and evolving language, by learning best practices This book is for anyone who wants to use Power BI to build advanced and complex models. Some experience writing DAX is helpful, but not essential if you have experience with other data query languages such as MDX or SQL. Philip Seamark is an experienced data warehouse (DW) and business intelligence (BI) consultant with a deep understanding of the Microsoft stack and extensive knowledge of DW methodologies and enterprise data modeling. He has more than 25 years of commercial experience delivering business applications across a broad range of technologies with expertise in project management, dimensional modeling, performance tuning, ETL design, development and optimization, and report and dashboard design, installation, and administration. Phil received a Microsoft Data Platform MVP award for his contributions to the Power BI community site, and was named a top 10 influencer in the Power BI space. He speaks at data, analytic, and reporting events around the world. He is also the founder and organizer of the Wellington Power BI User Group. Thomas Martens has more than 20 years of experience in the fields of BI, DW, and analytics. As Principal Consultant of Business Intelligence and Analytics, he helps large enterprises to implement sustainable analytical applications. He specializes in the visualization of data, and the application of analytical methods to large amounts of data. He recognizes DAX as a powerful query language available in many products and wants to create solutions to bring DAX users to the next level."

                "This volume contains the edited texts of the lectures presented at the workshop on Nonlinear Optimization: Theory and Applications, held in Erice at the \"G. Stampacchia\" School of Mathematics of the \"E. Majorana\" International Centre for Scientific Culture June 13-21, 1995. The meeting was conceived to review and discuss recent advances and promising research trends concerning theory, algorithms, and innovative applications in the field This is a field of mathematics which is providing viable of Nonlinear Optimization. tools in engineering, in economics and in other applied sciences, and which is giving a great contribution also in the solution of the more practiced linear optimization prob\u00ad lems. The meeting was attended by approximately 70 people from 18 countries. Besides the lectures, several formal and informal discussions took place. The result was a broad exposure providing a wide and deep understanding of the present research achievements in the field. We wish to express our appreciation for the active contributions of all the partici\u00ad pants in the meeting. Our gratitude is due to the Ettore Majorana Center in Erice, which offered its facilities and stimulating environment: its staff was certainly instrumental for the success of the meeting. Our gratitude is also due to Francisco Facchinei and Massino Roma for the time spent in the organization of the workshop, and to Giuliana Cai for the careful typesetting of this volume."

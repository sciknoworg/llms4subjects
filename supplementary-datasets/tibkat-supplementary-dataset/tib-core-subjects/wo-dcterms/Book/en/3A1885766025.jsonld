            "abstract": "Different perspectives aiming to understand the complex relationship of humans and resources were the main focus of the international workshop \u2018Beyond Subsistence: Human-Nature Interactions\u2019, which took place within the initiatives of the Collaborative Research Centre SFB 1070 ResourceCultures at the University of T\u00fcbingen. Cultural anthropologists and archaeologists came together to reflect on the meanings and values of different socio-cultural practices surrounding the interactions between humans and nature, which go beyond the pure subsistence needs. From the exploration of modern rice cultivation in India to the personal ornaments of Ice Age Germany, the case studies examined here provide insights on multiple aspects of the existence of humans, animals, plants and substances. By reflecting on behaviours and practices from modern and archaeological contexts, this edited volume offers a detailed report of the interdisciplinary discussions that occurred during the workshop and ultimately allow us to reflect on how we understand the multi-layered interactions among all types of social actors",

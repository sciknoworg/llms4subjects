            "abstract": "This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Morocco for the period FY2019-24 has the overarching goal of contributing to social cohesion by improving the conditions for growth and job creation and reducing social and territorial disparities. Prepared collaboratively by IBRD, IFC and MIGA, the CPF translates the recommendations of the SCD and the Country Private Sector Diagnostic (CPSD) into an integrated World Bank Group (WBG) engagement. The CPF is aligned with the objectives of the Government's Program and Medium-Term Strategy 2017-21. It is also consistent with the third phase (2019-23) of the Government's National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), which focuses on strengthening human capital through improved education, healthcare and social protection, and on enhancing youth economic inclusion. Opportunities for youth are at the center of the CPF.The CPF responds to Morocco's ambition to successfully navigate this crucial point in its history. To achieve its objective of contributing to social cohesion and reducing social and territorial disparities, this CPF pursues three strategic focus areas: (A) Promoting Job Creation by the Private Sector; (B) Strengthening Human Capital; and (C) Promoting Inclusive and Resilient Territorial Development. Governance and Citizen Engagement are the foundational principles of the CPF, and Gender and Digital Technology are cross-cutting themes.Strong country ownership and demand are important determinants of the specific activities included in the CPF program. The first three years of the program have been defined jointly with the Government. The program supports the shift to a new development model, based on a scenario of deep and sustained structural reforms to increase productivity gains with special attention to innovation, market contestability and unleashing private sector potential.Under this scenario, Morocco would be able to maintain a relatively high rate of economic growth and economic convergence with more developed countries while preserving macroeconomic stability. The other two possible scenarios: voluntary growth-oriented policies without productivity-enhancing reforms or the pursuit of current macroeconomic and structural policies would respectively lead to large macroeconomic imbalances or a disappointing growth performance",

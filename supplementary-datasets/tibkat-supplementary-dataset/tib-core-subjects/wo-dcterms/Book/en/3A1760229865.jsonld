            "abstract": "The outbreak of the pandemic around the world came with national measures to deal with the health emergency that caused and will continue to cause important disruption in education for students, teachers, and policymakers. Digital technologies can provide innovative solutions that can prevent the negative effects of lockdowns of countries and regions on education. It is important to analyze digital solutions and experiences for distance learning and to better understand the available resources and best practices to deal effectively with the challenges of digital learning for both learners and academic staff. It is important that countries promote digital excellence and explore the opportunities that information technologies can provide to education institutions, especially in the post-pandemic scenario, and the major transformations it will bring to citizens, societies, and economies.The Handbook of Research on Analyzing IT Opportunities for Inclusive Digital Learning explores the new demands of labor markets in the digital economy, how educational institutions can respond to these new opportunities and threats, the development of new teaching and learning methods, and finally, the development of digital skills and competences. It also discusses the challenges and opportunities caused by the pandemic in the area of education and how information technologies can transform education and develop a new workforce with the required digital skills and competences and knowledge to fit the post-pandemic labor market. This book highlights topics including knowledge management systems, learning technologies, personalized learning, and more within the context of diverse student populations. It is a valuable reference tool for academics, researchers, lecturers, decision makers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in new theories, research findings, and case studies for understanding inclusive digital learning and the opportunities for digital technologies in education",

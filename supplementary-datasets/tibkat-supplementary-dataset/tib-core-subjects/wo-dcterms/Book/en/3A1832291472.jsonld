            "abstract": "The book focuses on the techniques for UAV-based 3D mapping and its applications in varying fields since the explosive development of UAV-based photogrammetric 3D mapping and their wide applications from traditional surveying and mapping to other related fields have been witnessed in photogrammetry and remote sensing. In the last decade, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images have become one of the most important remote sensing data sources for photogrammetric 3D mapping. Besides, the rapid development of recent techniques, e.g., SfM (Structure from Motion) for off-line image orientation, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for on-line UAV navigation, and the deep learning (DL) embedded 3D reconstruction pipeline, has promoted UAV-based 3D mapping towards the direction of automation and intelligence. It is really worthy to collecting the cutting-edge techniques and reporting their promising applications",

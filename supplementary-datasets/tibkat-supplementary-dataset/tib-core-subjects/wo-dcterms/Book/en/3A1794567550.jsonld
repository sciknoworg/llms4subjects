            "abstract": "Numerical linear algebra is a very important topic in mathematics and has important recent applications in deep learning, machine learning, image processing, applied statistics, artificial intelligence and other interesting modern applications in many fields. The purpose of this Special Issue in Mathematics is to present the latest contributions and recent developments in numerical linear algebra and applications in different real domains. We invite authors to submit original and new papers and high-quality reviews related to the following topics: applied linear algebra, linear and nonlinear systems of equations, large matrix equations, numerical tensor problems with applications, ill-posed problems and image processing, linear algebra and applied statistics, model reduction in dynamic systems, and other related subjects. The submitted papers will be reviewed in line with the traditional submission process. This Special Issue will be dedicated to the inspired mathematician Constantin Petridi, who has devoted his life to mathematics",

            "abstract": "The current book consists of eighteen chapters divided into three sections. Section I includes nine topics in characterization techniques and evaluation of advanced ceramics dealing with newly developed photothermal, ultrasonic and ion spattering techniques, the neutron irradiation and the properties of ceramics, the existence of a polytypic multi-structured boron carbide, the oxygen isotope exchange between gases and nanoscale oxides and the evaluation of perovskite structures ceramics for sensors and ultrasonic applications. Section II includes six topics in raw materials, processes and mechanical and other properties of conventional and advanced ceramic materials, dealing with the evaluation of local raw materials and various types and forms of wastes for ceramics production, the effect of production parameters on ceramic properties, the evaluation of dental ceramics through application parameters and the reinforcement of ceramics by fibers. Section III, includes three topics in degradation, aging and healing of ceramic materials, dealing with the effect of granite waste addition on artificial and natural degradation bricks, the effect of aging, micro-voids, and self-healing on mechanical properties of glass ceramics and the crack-healing ability of structural ceramics",

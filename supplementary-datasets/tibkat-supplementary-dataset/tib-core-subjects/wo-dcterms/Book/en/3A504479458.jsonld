            "abstract": "The morphological study of  the lower jaw of  a dolphin (Tursiops truncatus p.) and calculation of the beam pattern (BP) of  echolocation hearing have been conducted. It was determined that the morphological structures of the lower jaw (left and right halves) represent two hydro-acoustic receiving antennas of the \"travelling wave\" (TWA) type. It was shown that the mandibular canal's (MC) cross sectional area increases exponentially. The MC represents the acoustical horn.  The mental foramens (MFs) is positioned in the horn throat, representing the non-equidistant array of wave-guide delay lines (NAWDL). They set the amplitude and phase distributions of each antenna array. The acoustical horn ensures the travelling wave conditions inside the MC and intensifies sonar echoes up to 1500 times. The BP of echolocation hearing was calculated according to the TWA model, with taking into consideration of acoustic shielding and diffraction of a sound on the rostrum structures in the area of the MFs. The BP is naturally determined by the functionality of echolocation hearing. The BPs of the left and right of  TWAs cross one another in the nasal area allowing an animal to execute a monopulse analysis of an echo by a comparison method. At the same time, the \"dead\" zone in dorsal direction defends the echolocation hearing against a surface reverberation of dolphin's clicks. The large area of the BPs crossing in the ventral direction are improving the reception of bottom reverberation carrying information about water depth. The echolocation hearing is equally well adapted for both echolocation and detection and for an echo impulses localization. It is very likely, that  morphological structures of the lower jaw in the Odontocety represent the peripheral section of the echolocation hearing.",

            "abstract": "This book examines the requirements, risks, and solutions to improve the security and quality of complex cyber-physical systems (C-CPS), such as production systems, power plants, and airplanes, in order to ascertain whether it is possible to protect engineering organizations against cyber threats and to ensure engineering project quality. The book consists of three parts that logically build upon each other. Part I \"Product Engineering of Complex Cyber-Physical Systems\" discusses the structure and behavior of engineering organizations producing complex cyber-physical systems, providing insights into processes and engineering activities, and highlighting the requirements and border conditions for secure and high-quality engineering. Part II \"Engineering Quality Improvement\" addresses quality improvements with a focus on engineering data generation, exchange, aggregation, and use within an engineering organization, and the need for proper data modeling and engineering-result validation. Lastly, Part III \"Engineering Security Improvement\" considers security aspects concerning C-CPS engineering, including engineering organizations\u2019 security assessments and engineering data management, security concepts and technologies that may be leveraged to mitigate the manipulation of engineering data, as well as design and run-time aspects of secure complex cyber-physical systems. The book is intended for several target groups: it enables computer scientists to identify research issues related to the development of new methods, architectures, and technologies for improving quality and security in multi-disciplinary engineering, pushing forward the current state of the art. It also allows researchers involved in the engineering of C-CPS to gain a better understanding of the challenges and requirements of multi-disciplinary engineering that will guide them in their future research and development activities. Lastly, it offers practicing engineers and managers with engineering backgrounds insights into the benefits and limitations of applicable methods, architectures, and technologies for selected use cases",

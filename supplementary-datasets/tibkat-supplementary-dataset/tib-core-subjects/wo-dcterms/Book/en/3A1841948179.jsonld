                "Build different components of larger systems using class sets of micro:bits with Python in a truly collaborative way. First you\u2019ll explore ways to harness the capabilities of the humble micro:bit and learn to creatively overcome some of its limitations; learning practical text-based programming along the way. We\u2019ll then move on to building projects that allow multiple micro:bits, and other microcontroller boards and parts like the Raspberry Pi, to communicate with one another, and coordinate their operations to build larger systems. Rather than just being a guide to learning these skills, this book will include tips and stories about implementing the these ideas in classrooms, Code Clubs, and Maker environments. Practical logistics for preparation and easy set-up, as well as, acceptance criteria and accountability for students and participants is included. These ideas were gained over years of running a Code Club and running Maker workshops and events. You\u2019ll learn about programming collaborative solutions and design logic. Then you\u2019ll scale that logic up to more complex projects. By the end, you\u2019ll have added additional electronic and physical components to projects that interact with the world. You\u2019ll create fun inventions together, using hardware, coding, electronics, physical objects, and e-textiles. You will: Solve problems and create art by modelling solutions and ideas with a combination of Python coding, electronic systems engineering, and creative design. Navigate the logistical and unique challenges that come with running your own Code Club, Makerspace, or feeding these activities into STEAM design and technology curriculums. Take new Makers from simply copying and duplicating through to debugging and understanding."

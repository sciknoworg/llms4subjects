From there the study considers Hiroshima after its destruction by the atomic bomb in 1945, looking at residents\u2019 desire to combine urban-planning concepts, the effort to remake Hiroshima as a high-tech city in the 1990s, and postwar planning on Okinawa, where American influences were particularly strong. The final chapter examines the growth of tourism on Guam and the use of the island for military purposes and links these to developments in the Philippines and American S\u00e2moa",

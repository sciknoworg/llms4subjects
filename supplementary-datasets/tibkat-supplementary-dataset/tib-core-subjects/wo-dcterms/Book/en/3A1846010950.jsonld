                "This book explores the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary fields of energy systems, occupant behavior, thermal comfort, air quality and economic modelling across levels of building, communities and cities, through various data analytical approaches. It highlights the complex interplay of heating/cooling, ventilation and power systems in different processes, such as design, renovation and operation, for buildings, communities and cities. Methods from classical statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are applied into analyses for different building/urban components and systems. Knowledge from this book assists to accelerate sustainability of the society, which would contribute to a prospective improvement through data analysis in the liveability of both built and urban environment. This book targets a broad readership with specific experience and knowledge in data analysis, energy system, built environment and urban planning. As such, it appeals to researchers, graduate students, data scientists, engineers, consultants, urban scientists, investors and policymakers, with interests in energy flexibility, building/city resilience and climate neutrality. .",

                "The rheology of polymer melts plays an important role today in industry and academia. Although several textbooks on this subject are available, with very few exceptions they cover homogeneous products only. This book is unique in that it focuses on heterogeneous systems such as particle-filled materials and polymer blends, which are highly important in the world market. It deals with similarities and differences of the flow properties of these two classes of material, providing both a fundamental and a practical understanding. Key points of the book are the viscous and elastic properties of engineering polymers filled with functional particles and the influence of nanoparticles on rheological properties.   Two key aspects of rheological measurements are discussed: the influence of heterogeneous structures on the flow of materials important for processing and the use of rheological means to get an insight into morphological features. Both approaches are applied to particle-filled melts and to polymer blends. In the latter case it is shown in detail in which way the deformation of droplets formed by the dispersed phase can be affected by outer deformation, particularly in elongation.  Helmut M\u00fcnstedt is retired professor and former Head of the Institute of Polymer Materials of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. He is a leading expert in polymer science and rheology and made important contributions to relationships between structure and properties of polymeric materials. Under his guidance developments in measurement techniques such as the application of laser-Doppler velocimetry to polymer melts and the M\u00fcnstedt tensile rheometer were carried out. He is author of over 200 publications in scientific journals, concerning various fields of polymers.",

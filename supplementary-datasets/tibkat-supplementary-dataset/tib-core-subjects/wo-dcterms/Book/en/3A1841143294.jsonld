            "title": "The Pandemic Divide : How COVID Increased Inequality in America",
            "abstract": "As COVID-19 made inroads in the United States in spring 2020, a common refrain rose above the din: \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d However, the full picture was far more complicated\u2014and far less equitable. Black and Latinx populations suffered illnesses, outbreaks, and deaths at much higher rates than the general populace. Those working in low-paid jobs and those living in confined housing or communities already disproportionately beset by health problems were particularly vulnerable. The contributors to The Pandemic Divide explain how these and other racial disparities came to the forefront in 2020. They explore COVID-19\u2019s impact on multiple arenas of daily life\u2014including wealth, health, housing, employment, and education\u2014while highlighting what steps could have been taken to mitigate the full force of the pandemic. Most crucially, the contributors offer concrete public policy solutions that would allow the nation to respond effectively to future crises and improve the long-term well-being of all Americans.Contributors.

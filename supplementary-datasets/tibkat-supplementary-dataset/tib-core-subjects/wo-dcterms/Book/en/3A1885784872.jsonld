            "abstract": "Chapter 4 - Iron-based heterogeneous Fenton processes have been used to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. However, their efficiency is limited by iron's low solubility and iron sludge formation. Iron-based nanomaterials have been proposed to enhance the performance of the Fenton process. Researchers can employ zero-valent iron and iron oxide nanoparticles in their processes, to mention a few. This chapter reviews the recent findings in various iron-based nanostructures, their synthesis and characterization, and their application in iron-based Fenton processes. The nano-effects involved in the degradation of organic pollutants and the factors that boost the performance of the process are also discussed. It is concluded by highlighting the potential of nanomaterials in enhancing the efficiency of iron-based Fenton processes for wastewater treatment and identifying the challenges and future directions in this field",

            "abstract": "Robotics and control are both research and application domains that have been frequently engineered through the use of interdisciplinary approaches like cybernetics. Cognition is a particular concept of this approach, abstracted from the context of living organisms to that of artificial devices, and is concerned with knowledge acquisition and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses. Cognitive robotics and control refer to knowledge processing as much as knowledge generation from problem understanding, leading to special forms of architectures that enable systems to behave in an autonomous way. The main aim of this book is to highlight emerging applications and address recent breakthroughs in the domain of cognitive robotics and control and related areas. Procedures, algorithms, architectures, and implementations for reasoning, problem solving, or decision making are considered in the domain of robotics and control",

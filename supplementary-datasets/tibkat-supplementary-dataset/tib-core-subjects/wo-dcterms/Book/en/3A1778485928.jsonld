            "title": "Soybean - Biomass, Yield and Productivity",
            "abstract": "Plants are important for a permanent ecosystem, because in the ecological pyramid plants support all the other living organisms at the base. Very important organization is thought to be the integral process of resource, transport, partitioning, metabolism, and production, which involves yield, biomass, and productivity in plants. Accordingly, it is important to obtain more information about the knowledge concerning yield, biomass, and productivity in plants. Soybean is one of the main crops largely contributing to our life, which is thought to be connected to our ecosystem through the above-mentioned integral process. This book focuses on the soybean, and reviews and research concerning the yield, biomass, and productivity of soybean are presented herein. This text updates the book published in 2017. Although there are many difficulties, the main aim of this book is to present a basis for the above-mentioned integral processes of resource, transport, partitioning, metabolism, and production, which involves yield, biomass, and productivity in plants (soybean), and to understand what supports this basis and the integral process. It is hoped that this and the preceding book will be essential reads",

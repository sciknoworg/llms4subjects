            "abstract": "Winner of the 2021 BPS Book Award: Academic Text category, this groundbreaking book employs a transdisciplinary and poststructuralist methodology to develop the concept of \u2018postfeminist healthism,\u2019 a twenty-first-century understanding of women\u2019s physical and mental health formed at the intersections of postfeminist sensibilities, neoliberal constructs of citizenship and the notion of health as an individual responsibility managed through consumption. Postfeminist healthism is used in this book to explore seven topics where postfeminist sensibility has the most impact on women\u2019s health: self-help, weight, surgical technologies, sex, pregnancy, responsibilities for others\u2019 health and pro-anorexia communities. The book explores the ways in which the desire to be normal and live a good life is tied to expectations of \u2018normal-perfection\u2019 circulated across interpersonal interactions, media representations and expert discourses. It diagnoses postfeminist healthism as unhealthy for both those women who participate in it and those whom it excludes and considers how more positive directions may emerge.\u3000 By exploring the under-researched intersection of postfeminism and health studies, this book will be invaluable to researchers and students in psychology, gender and women\u2019s studies, health research, media studies and sociology",

            "abstract": "The Political Economy of Palestine is the \u2018go to\u2019 collection of timely essays committed to liberation and decolonisation. A fabulous yet daunting read. Professor Ray Bush, University of Leeds This book will prove to be an essential resource for students of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Professor Elia Zureik, Queen\u2019s University This brilliant book brings together some of the most innovative and critical work on the political economy of Palestine today. A fascinating collection that makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the Palestinian struggle - past, present, and future. Professor Adam Hanieh, SOAS University of London Edward Said wrote: \u201cWe can not fight for our rights and our history as well as future until we are armed with weapons of criticism and dedicated consciousness.\u201d This book provides both. Professor Mandy Turner, University of Manchester This book explores the political economy of Palestine through critical, interdisciplinary, and decolonial perspectives, underscoring that an approach to economics that does not consider the political\u2014a de-politicized economics\u2014is inadequate to understanding the situation in occupied Palestine. A critical interdisciplinary approach to political economy challenges prevailing neoliberal logics and structures that reproduce racial capitalism, and explores how the political economy of occupied Palestine is shaped by processes of accumulation by exploitation and dispossession from both Israel and global business, as well as from Palestinian elites. A decolonial approach to Palestinian political economy foregrounds struggles against neoliberal and settler colonial policies and institutions, and aids in the de-fragmentation of Palestinian life, land, and political economy that the Oslo Accords perpetuated, but whose histories of de-development over all of Palestine can be traced back for over a century. The chapters in this book offer an in-depth contextualization of the Palestinian political economy, analyze the political economy of integration, fragmentation, and inequality, and explore and problematize multiple sectors and themes of political economy in the absence of sovereignty.

It explains advanced concepts in a simple manner using numerous illustrative examples and MATLAB\u00ae codes. Features: Provides analysis of members under unsymmetrical bending Includes coverage of structures with special geometry and their use in offshore applications for ultra-deep water oil and gas exploration Presents numerical modeling and analysis of steel members under fire conditions, impact, and blast loads Includes MATLAB\u00ae examples that will aid in the capacity building of civil engineering students approaching this complex subject Written for a broad audience, the presentation of design concepts of steel members will be suitable for upper-level undergraduate students. The advanced design theories for offshore structures under special loads will be an attractive feature for post-graduate students and researchers. Practicing engineers will also find the book useful, as it includes numerous solved examples and practical tutorials\"--",

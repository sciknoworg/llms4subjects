            "abstract": "These contribution books collect reviews and original articles from eminent experts working in the interdisciplinary arena of biomaterial development and use. From their direct and recent experience, the readers can achieve a wide vision on the new and ongoing potentialities of different synthetic and engineered biomaterials. Contributions were selected not based on a direct market or clinical interest, but based on results coming from very fundamental studies. This too will allow to gain a more general view of what and how the various biomaterials can do and work for, along with the methodologies necessary to design, develop and characterize them, without the restrictions necessarily imposed by industrial or profit concerns. The chapters have been arranged to give readers an organized view of this research area. In particular, this book contains 25 chapters related to recent researches on new and known materials, with a particular attention to their physical, mechanical and chemical characterization, along with biocompatibility and hystopathological studies. Readers will be guided inside the range of disciplines and design methodologies used to develope biomaterials possessing the physical and biological properties needed for specific medical and clinical applications",

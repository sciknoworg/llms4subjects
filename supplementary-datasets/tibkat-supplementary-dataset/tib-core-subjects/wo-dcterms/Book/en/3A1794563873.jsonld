            "abstract": "This book is devoted to the teaching and learning of fluid mechanics. Fluid mechanics occupies a privileged position in the sciences; it is taught in various science departments including physics, mathematics, mechanical, chemical and civil engineering and environmental sciences, each highlighting a different aspect or interpretation of the foundation and applications of fluids. While scholarship in fluid mechanics is vast, expanding into the areas of experimental, theoretical and computational fluid mechanics, there is little discussion among scientists about the different possible ways of teaching this subject. We think there is much to be learned, for teachers and students alike, from an interdisciplinary dialogue about fluids. This volume therefore highlights articles which have bearing on the pedagogical aspects of fluid mechanics at the undergraduate and graduate level",

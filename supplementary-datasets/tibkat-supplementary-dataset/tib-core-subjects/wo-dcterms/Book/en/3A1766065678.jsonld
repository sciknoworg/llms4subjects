                "\"The story of 3D printing-or additive manufacturing-was initiated as a \"rapid prototype development\" tool, which is one of its major applications, and which led to advanced 3D printing technology in the application of a wide range of diverse fields, such as manufacturing, medicine, architecture, and custom art and design, and the list goes on. This new volume, 3D Printing Technology and Its Diverse Applications, explores the exciting and diverse applications of three-dimensional printing in a variety of industries, including food processing, environmental sciences, biotechnology, medical devices, energy storage, civil engineering, textiles and fashion industry, and more. 3D printing is rapidly transforming the way products are designed and manufactured across complex supply chains. Over the past decade, newer challenges are being addressed by 3D printing, and a technology that was once popular in the aerospace and automotive industries is today an integral part of jewelry design, architecture, medical, storage devices, biotechnology, shop floor innovation, to name a few. This book explores many of these diverse applications and describes the various 3D printing methods, the commonly used materials, and the pros and cons. The book also includes an overview of the historical development and modern day trends in additive manufacturing as well as an exploration of the prospects of 3D printing technology in promoting academic education. The informative volume gives readers a thorough understanding of the versatile applications of 3D printing in various domains of engineering and technology and beyond\"--",

                "Biology is a source of fascination for most scientists, whether their training is in the life sciences or not. In particular, there is a special satisfaction in discovering an understanding of biology in the context of another science like mathematics. Fortunately there are plenty of interesting (and fun) problems in biology, and virtually all scientific disciplines have become the richer for it. For example, two major journals, Mathematical Biosciences and Journal of Mathematical Biology, have tripled in size since their inceptions 20-25 years ago. The various sciences have a great deal to give to one another, but there are still too many fences separating them. In writing this book we have adopted the philosophy that mathematical biology is not merely the intrusion of one science into another, but has a unity of its own, in which both the biology and the math\u00ad ematics should be equal and complete, and should flow smoothly into and out of one another. We have taught mathematical biology with this philosophy in mind and have seen profound changes in the outlooks of our science and engineering students: The attitude of \"Oh no, another pendulum on a spring problem!,\" or \"Yet one more LCD circuit!\" completely disappeared in the face of applications of mathematics in biology. There is a timeliness in calculating a protocol for ad\u00ad ministering a drug."

Bratton -- The single constituency argument in the economic analysis of business law / David Millon -- Corporate law and the rhetoric of choice / Kent Greenfield -- The dividend puzzle : are shares entitled to the residual / Daniel J.H. Greenwood -- Corporate social responsibility : lessons from the south on law and business norms / Claire Moore Dickerson -- The discourse of contract and the law of marriage / Thomas W. Joo -- Behavioural biology, the rational actor model, and the new feminist agenda / June Carbone and Naomi Cahn -- Race to the top of the corporation : what minorities do when they get there / Devon Carbado, Mitu Gulati -- Workplace racial discrimination and the professionals at the centre of corporate hierarchies / Cheryl L. Wade. - This volume explores the relationship between law and economics principles and the promotion of social justice. By social justice, we mean a vision of society that embraces more than traditional economic efficiency. Such a vision might include, for example, a reduction of subordination and discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability or class; increased wealth dispersion throughout all sectors of society; a safe and healthy environment; worker rights; and, a flourishing political democracy. The volume chapters here fall into four main categories, Assumptions of Law & Economics; Law & Economics: Implications of Behavioralism; Economics and Corporate Governance: Finding the Holes; and, Gender, Class and Race: Implications of and Alternatives to the Dominant Economic Paradigm. In addition, most of the chapters invoke the lens of corporate law theory or the corporate context as part of their analysis of the intersection of economics and social justice",

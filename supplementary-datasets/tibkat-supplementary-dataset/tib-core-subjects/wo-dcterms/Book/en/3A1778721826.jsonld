            "title": "Petri Nets : Applications",
            "abstract": "Petri Nets are graphical and mathematical tool used in many different science domains. Their characteristic features are the intuitive graphical modeling language and advanced formal analysis method. The concurrence of performed actions is the natural phenomenon due to which Petri Nets are perceived as mathematical tool for modeling concurrent systems. The nets whose model was extended with the time model can be applied in modeling real-time systems. Petri Nets were introduced in the doctoral dissertation by K.A. Petri, titled \u201c\u201eKommunikation mit Automaten\u201d and published in 1962 by University of Bonn. During more than 40 years of development of this theory, many different classes were formed and the scope of applications was extended. Depending on particular needs, the net definition was changed and adjusted to the considered problem. The unusual \u201cflexibility\u201d of this theory makes it possible to introduce all these modifications. Owing to varied currently known net classes, it is relatively easy to find a proper class for the specific application. The present monograph shows the whole spectrum of Petri Nets applications, from classic applications (to which the theory is specially dedicated) like computer science and control systems, through fault diagnosis, manufacturing, power systems, traffic systems, transport and down to Web applications. At the same time, the publication describes the diversity of investigations performed with use of Petri Nets in science centers all over the world",

                "Data science is expanding across industries at a rapid pace, and the companies first to adopt best practices will gain a significant advantage. To reap the benefits, decision makers need to have a confident understanding of data science and its application in their organization. This third edition delves into the latest advancements in AI, particularly focusing on large language models (LLMs), with clear distinctions made between AI and traditional data science, including AI's ability to emulate human decision-making. Author Stylianos Kampakis introduces you to the critical aspect of ethics in AI, an area of growing importance and scrutiny. The narrative examines the ethical considerations intrinsic to the development and deployment of AI technologies, including bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability. You\u2019ll be provided with the expertise and tools required to develop a solid data strategy that is continuously effective. Ethics and legal issuessurrounding data collection and algorithmic bias are some common pitfalls that Kampakis helps you avoid, while guiding you on the path to build a thriving data science culture at your organization. This updated edition also includes plenty of case studies, tools for project assessment, and expanded content for hiring and managing data scientists. Data science is a language that everyone at a modern company should understand across departments. Friction in communication arises most often when management does not connect with what a data scientist is doing or how impactful data collection and storage can be for their organization. The Decision Maker\u2019s Handbook to Data Science bridges this gap and readies you for both the present and future of your workplace in this engaging, comprehensive guide. .",

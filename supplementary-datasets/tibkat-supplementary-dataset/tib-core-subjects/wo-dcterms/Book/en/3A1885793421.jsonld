            "abstract": "Is preparing for war the best means of preserving peace? In                    Sisters in Peace, Kate Laing contends that this question has never been solely                    the concern of politicians and strategists. She maps successive generations of                    twentieth-century women who were eager to engage in political debate even though                    legislative and cultural barriers worked to exclude their voices. In 1915,                    during the First World War, the Women's International Congress at The Hague                    was convened after alarmed and bereaved women from both sides of the conflict                    insisted that their opinions on war and the pathway to peace be heard. From this                    gathering emerged the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom                    (WILPF), which to this day campaigns against militarism and nuclear weapons. In                    Australia, the formation of a section of WILPF connected political women to a                    worldwide network that sustained their anti-war activism throughout the last                    century. In examining the rise of WILPF in Australia, Sisters in Peace provides                    a gendered history of this country\u2019s engagement with the politics of                    internationalism. This is a history of WILPF women who committed to peace                    activism even as Australia\u2019s national identity and military allegiances shifted                    over time\u2014a history that has until now been an overlooked part of the Australian                    peace movement",

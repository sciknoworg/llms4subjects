            "abstract": "\"This book provides a holistic view of desalination, highlighting the important role this technology can play in providing safe access to water across the globe. Desalination is to the water industry what renewables are to the electricity sector, however the former is being deployed in a quiet revolution away from public glare. This book describes the context for this technology to flourish in the coming decades. It discusses the pressures on freshwater resources and the key role the desalination industry plays as it moves from a good-to-have provider today, to a must-have mainstream water solution in the future. The book explores the vital elements of the desalination industry, including the winning technologies, and how further technological developments will reduce costs and increase deployment into new areas. It also addresses the energy used and the key environmental issues of carbon dioxide emissions and brine waste production. Using a series of country case studies, the book illustrates how desalination can supplement natural water resources in different environments and for different purposes, and how it is supporting domestic and economic activity. Providing a forward-thinking assessment, the book considers developments over the next thirty years as climate change impacts become even more apparent. This book will be of great interest to those working to alleviate water scarcity and to improve water security. It will also be of interest to those in water resource management, water policy and regulation, and water science and environmental engineering\"--",

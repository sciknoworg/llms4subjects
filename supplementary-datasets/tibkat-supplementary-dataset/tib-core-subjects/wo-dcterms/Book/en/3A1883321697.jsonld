                "This textbook describes the study of radiation, covering the basic concepts and their advanced applications, and highlights the handling of radioisotopes and radiation measurements using various instruments. The book also focuses on the effects and up-to-date applications of radiation on biological systems and their use in diagnosing and treating various diseases. Chapters provide an easy understanding of the subject matter with the help of self-explanatory, well-illustrated figures and easy-to-grasp language. \u201cTools and Techniques in Radiation Biophysics\u201d is designed for undergraduate and post-graduate studying radiation Biophysics as one of the major courses in medical physics, nuclear medicine, biophysics, and other applied sciences. The multi-disciplinary approach of this book facilitates learning and a deep understanding of the concepts and helps the readers develop an interest in the subject so that they can pursue their careers efficiently in this field. Researchers and lecturers will value this book to enhance their knowledge and clarify queries.",

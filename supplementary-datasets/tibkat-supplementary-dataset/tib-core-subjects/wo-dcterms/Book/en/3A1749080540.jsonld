            "abstract": "The book promotes a meaningful and appropriate dialogue and cross-disciplinary partnerships on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in governance and disaster management. The frequency and the cost of losses and damages due to disasters are rising every year. From wildfires to tsunamis, drought to hurricanes, floods to landslides combined with chemical, nuclear and biological disasters of epidemic proportions has increased human vulnerability and ecosystem sustainability. Life is not as it used to be and governance to manage disasters cannot be a business as usual. The quantum and proportion of responsibilities with the emergency services has increased many times to strain them beyond their human capacities. It's time that the struggling disaster management services get supported and facilitated by new technology of combining AI and Machine Learning (ML) with Data Analytics Technologies (DAT) to serve people and government in disaster management. AI and ML have advanced to a state where they could be utilized for many operations in disaster risk reduction. Even though many disasters cannot be prevented and a number of them are blind natural disasters yet through an appropriate application of AI and ML quick predictions, vulnerability identification and classification of relief and rescue operations could be achieved. Prof. Dr T.V. Vijay Kumar is Professor and Dean, School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Delhi, India. Dr Keshav Sud is currently working as Senior Manager of Data Science at Keurig Dr Pepper where he is leading the development of recommendation engines. Dr. Sud is a well-recognized expert in the field of AI with first authorship of numerous scholarly articles in internationally recognized professional publications",

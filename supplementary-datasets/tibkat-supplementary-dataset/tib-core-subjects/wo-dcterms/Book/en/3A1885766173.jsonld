            "abstract": "Bio-inspired superhydrophobic coatings exhibit exceptional nonwetting properties, characterized by a large contact angle and minimal contact angle hysteresis. As a result, they have generated significant interest across diverse fields. This book explores advancements in superhydrophobic coatings, including their fabrication and application. It specifically addresses environmentally friendly chemicals for fabricating superhydrophobic coatings. Moreover, it delves into the application of superhydrophobic coatings in various scenarios, including anti-icing, anti-biofouling, and gas\u2013liquid separation. By addressing these topics, the book offers a comprehensive overview of the historical background and progress made in the realm of superhydrophobic coatings. Furthermore, it serves as a rallying call to scientists worldwide, urging collaborative efforts to overcome development barriers and explore new application domains for the lotus-inspired superhydrophobic coating",

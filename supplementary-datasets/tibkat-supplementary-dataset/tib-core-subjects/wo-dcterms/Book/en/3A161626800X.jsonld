                "\"Emigration and Caribbean Literature re-assesses the cohort of Caribbean authors who migrated to Britain and France between and after the two World Wars in order to analyse how their social situations as new colonial arrivals in a rapidly changing Europe influenced the reception, orientation and content of their first major works\"--",
                "\"Emigration and Caribbean Literature is a fresh and necessary re-engagement with the generation of writers from the Caribbean Basin who journeyed to Europe to establish their names and literary reputations between and after the two World Wars. It reads across the Anglophone and Francophone traditions to take as its focus Lamming, Cape;cia, Naipaul, Ce;saire, Selvon, and Glissant, focusing firmly on their shared status as emigrants and the effects of their migration on the content and composition of their first works. By applying the theories of Antonio Gramsci, Pierre Bourdieu, and Pascale Casanova to readings of these authors' contexts and the content of their texts, the book reveals how World War-era Caribbean writers were pushed to represent themselves as authentic spokesmen for their people, self-representations that are everywhere undermined by fiction and poetry that express the specific concerns of Caribbean emigrant intellectuals\"--",

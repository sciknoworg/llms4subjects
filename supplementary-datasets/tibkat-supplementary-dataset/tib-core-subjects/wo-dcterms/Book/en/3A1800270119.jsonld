                "\u201cThis is a fascinating edited volume that uniquely draws on the expertise of Mexican academics and grassroots activists to explore the positive and negative effects of institutional reforms to promote gender equality in Mexico.\u201d - Leslie Schwindt-Bayer, Professor, Rice University, Houston, US \u201cPolitical Representation and Gender Equality in Mexico does what no other collection has done. By bringing not only academic voices to a discussion of women\u2019s political representation in Mexico, but also the invaluable insight of practitioners and grassroots activists, this volume provides a holistic understanding of Mexico\u2019s journey to gender equality.\u201d - Magda Hinojosa, Professor, Arizona State University, Tempe, US \u201cThis timely and important collection brings together Mexico\u2019s leading scholars and activists working on gender and politics. Vidal-Correa\u2019s excellent and well-edited volume is required reading for everyone interested in Latin American politics.\u201d - Jennifer M. Piscopo, Associate Professor, Occidental College, Los Angeles, US The field of gender and politics has continuously grown, becoming more interdisciplinary and engaging with issues, context and people from all around the world. Because of this, new emerging approaches and studies challenge embedded notions, ideas and preconceptions of how the world is meant to be studied and understood. This is particularly true for studies on women and their engagement in political affairs. How should institutions conceptualize women in order to advance rules and mechanisms that favor women? What roles do representatives have on the making of gender equality? When women are legislating, which are the consequences of the approved legislation? Fernanda Vidal-Correa is Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Social Sciences at Universidad Panamericana, Campus Mexico. She is currently Dean for Research in the School of Communication."

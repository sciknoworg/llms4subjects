                "This book analyzes the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 nations\u2019 concerns and policies relating to national security threats through an interdisciplinary theoretical engagement with the Political, Information, Security and Economic (PISE) Model. Through the analysis of secondary data sources such as scholarly and government reports, policy documents, press releases and interviews, the author analyzes the five case studies\u2014Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and the USA\u2014to determine how and why nations use the PISE variables to shape favorable homeland security outcomes, to determine what the points of homeland intersectoral collaboration are among the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 nations. In so doing, Weaver determines that although the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries have concerns about homeland security and each, individually, identifies threats and hazards, they do also employ collaborative measures to build resilience and increase efforts to prepare for anticipated security breaches. John Weaver is an associate professor of Intelligence Analysis at York College of Pennsylvania (USA), a retired DOD civilian from the United States\u2019 Intelligence Community, and has served as an officer in the US Army (retiring at the rank of lieutenant colonel). He has lived and worked on four continents and in 19 countries respectively, spending nearly eight years overseas (on behalf of the US government). His experience includes multiple combat deployments, peace enforcement, peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and disaster assistance support in both conventional and unconventional/non-traditional units. John has trained and certified multinational NATO reconnaissance teams based in the Netherlands, Germany and Spain for worldwide deployment in full-spectrum mission sets. He has also personally led several reconnaissance missions throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (including multiple missions in Afghanistan)."

            "abstract": "The port of Jakarta is the incontestable gateway to Indonesia. As an archipelago state, Indonesia has much to gain from improving its maritime connectivity and attracting more direct liner services. These services rely on ever larger ships. What is needed to attract them, and how could Jakarta best handle them? This report brings more clarity to these issues by assessing the impacts of very large container ships for Jakarta. It analyses current policies and offers recommendations on how Indonesia\u2019s largest port could effectively prepare for the arrival of ships. This report is part of the International Transport Forum\u2019s Case-Specific Policy Analysis series. These are topical studies on specific issues carried out by the ITF in agreement with local institutions. The port of Jakarta is the incontestable gateway to Indonesia.

            "abstract": "\"This book is a collection of the most recent contributions in the area of Laser Welding Technique, from both fundamental and applied perspectives. It brings a total of thirteen chapters, covering different aspects of the laser welding field. From laser welding equipment to numerical modelling and simulation, digital twins, and artificial intelligence, the final work provides a comprehensive and accessible review of the state-of-the-art, also including metallurgy and quality assessment aspects in welded structures. Covering a wide span of themes within the laser welding research area, from the material science to the final products (including their performance on structural applications), passing by the fundamental aspects of mathematical and engineering characterization, product specification, limitations and possibilities of different laser welding technique, the book can be a useful source of information for decision-making by experienced engineers, as well as a reference work for students seeking for beginning his/her research activities in the field. Given the rapid and constantly evolving technology aspects in such a transversal (and integrative) area of research, the present book is definitely an added value for the future in the domain of Laser Welding Techniques\"--",

            "abstract": "\"Preface The progress in microelectronics in recent decades is really unimaginable. We have been witnessing unbelievable and so far undisturbed advance in device scaling and growth of integrated circuits in both functionality and complexity. Myths about the limits of miniaturization and scalability of transistors have been shattered one after another; roadblocks have been removed by power of human invention, fueled by market growth. The cost of a single transistor on silicon chip during the last 40 years decreased more than a million fold, as the number of devices on a single chip also increased more than a million fold, following the exponential dependence commonly known as the Moore's Law. Many people question if the semiconductor industry can achieve, or even afford, further scaling, especially because numerous challenges arise from both device physics and from manufacturing capabilities perspective. Traditional scaling based on reduction of physical dimensions of MOS transistors, with simultaneous reduction of supply voltages and dissipated power, is reaching its limits. It has been extended by innovations in device architecture, introduction of new materials, and inventive techniques of patterning features of nanometer size. This decreasing size comes at an increasing cost, so most recent technology generations do not offer much advantage in terms of cost per transistor, or cost per function, when compared to previous nodes\"--",

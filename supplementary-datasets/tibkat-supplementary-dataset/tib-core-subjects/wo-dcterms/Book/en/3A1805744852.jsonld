            "abstract": "\"Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Management contributes to the ongoing debate among innovation scholars and practitioners focusing on the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the ways companies and organizations do business, operate and innovate. It considers AI as a source of innovation both in terms of innovation within the field of AI itself (AI innovation) and in terms of how it enables or disrupts innovation in other fields (AI-driven innovation). The book's content is driven by several important conclusions: AI has a great potential for innovation, but this potential is associated with significant challenges. There are different views on how to implement AI in innovation management but little agreement and guidance on how to do it. AI not only has the potential to produce radically new innovations, but also to rethink innovation management in general. Deeper knowledge about the innovative impact of AI technologies would be highly relevant to both practitioners and academics within the field of IM. It is therefore both necessary and timely to explore the different aspects of the relationship between AI and Innovation Management (IM). The contributors to this book include both scholars and practitioners from multiple countries and different types of institutions. They were selected based on their ability to provide a relevant distinctive perspective on the relationship between AI and IM; the degree of their professional engagement with the field; their ability to contribute to the thematic and contextual diversity of the contributions; and their ability to provide actionable insights for both innovation scholars and practitioners. Helena Blackbright (M\u00e4lardalen University, Sweden) and Stoyan Tanev (Carleton University, Canada) are chairing the Special Interest Group on AI and IM at the International Society for Professional Innovation Management (https://www.ispim-innovation.com/)\"--",

            "abstract": "When was the last time you participated in an election for an online group chat or sat on a jury for a dispute about a controversial post? Platforms nudge users to tolerate nearly all-powerful admins, moderators, and \u201cbenevolent dictators for life.\u201d In Governable Spaces, Nathan Schneider argues that the internet has been plagued by a phenomenon he calls \u201cimplicit feudalism\u201d: a bias, both cultural and technical, for building communities as fiefdoms. The consequences have spread far beyond online spaces themselves. Feudal defaults train us to give up on our communities\u2019 democratic potential, inclining us to be more tolerant of autocratic tech CEOs and authoritarian politicians. But online spaces could be sites of a creative, radical, and democratic renaissance. Schneider shows how the internet can learn from governance legacies of the past to become a more democratic medium, responsive and inventive unlike anything that has come before. \u201cA prescient analysis of how we create democratic spaces for engagement in the age of polarization. Governable Spaces is new, impeccably researched, and imaginative.\u201d \u2014 Zizi Papacharissi, Professor of Communication and Political Science, University of Illinois at Chicago \u201cThis visionary book points a way to scrapping capitalist realism for community control over our digital spaces. Nathan Schneider generously brings together disparate wisdom from abolitionists, Black feminists, and cooperative software engineers to spark our own imaginations and experiments.\u201d \u2014 Lilly Irani, author of Chasing Innovation: Making Entrepreneurial Citizens in Modern India \u201cFrom feminist theory to blockchain governance, this dizzying array of topics pulls readers out of their comfort zone and forces a novel look at very old questions.\u201d \u2014 Ethan Zuckerman, Associate Professor of Public Policy, Communication, and Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst",

            "abstract": "Population is ageing at an unprecedented speed globally. As concept, ageing is considered a continuous process starting from birth and is accompanied by various physiological changes and a number of chronic diseases that affect health and quality of life. Ageing as a continuous process is depending on life course exposures to health risks, lifestyle and nutrition, socioeconomic background, and other factors. There is considerable interest among scientists regarding the direct and indirect effect of nutrition in optimal ageing. Nutrition has a beneficial effect in a variety of chronic disease that impact the process of ageing. Given the importance of this issue, the journal Nutrients is planning a Special Issue on \u201cAgeing and Nutrition through Lifespan\u201d with the aim of providing a source for accurate, up-to-date scientific information on this topic. We invite you and your co-workers to consider submission of your original research findings or a review article on the topic. Manuscripts should focus on the direct impact of specific food components, dietary patterns, energy intake, macro-, micro- nutrients, alcohol intake, food insecurity as well as malnourishment and appetite to the ageing process (healthy, active, successful ageing, frailty and other similar indices) across lifespan. In a similar way, we also welcome manuscripts that focus on the indirect effect of nutrition to the ageing process throughout the pathway of chronic disease (i.e., obesity, diabetes, depression and mental diseases)",

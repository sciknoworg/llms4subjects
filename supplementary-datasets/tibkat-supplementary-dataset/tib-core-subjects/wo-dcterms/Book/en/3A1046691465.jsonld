            "abstract": [
                "(1) The U.S. share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining rapidly as European and Asian universities, particularly from China, have increased S&E degrees while US degree production has stagnated",
                "This paper develops four propositions that show that changes in the global job market for science and engineering (S&E)  workers are eroding US dominance in S&E, which diminishes comparative advantage in high tech production and creates problems for American industry and workers",
                "2) The job market has worsened for young  workers in S&E fields relative to many other high-level occupations, which discourages US students from going on in S&E, but which still has sufficient rewards to attract large immigrant flows, particularly from developing countries",
                "To ease the adjustment to a less dominant position in science and engineering, the US will have to develop new labor market and R&D policies that build on existing strengths and develop new ways of benefitting from scientific and technological advances in other countries",
                "4) Diminished comparative advantage in high-tech will create a long period of adjustment for US workers, of which the off-shoring of IT jobs to India, growth of high-tech production in China, and multinational R&D facilities in developing countries, are harbingers",
                "3) Populous low income countries such as China and India can compete with the US in high tech by having many S&E specialists although those workers are a small proportion of their work forces.  This threatens to undo the \"North-South\" pattern of trade in which advanced countries dominate high tech while developing countries specialize in less skilled manufacturing"

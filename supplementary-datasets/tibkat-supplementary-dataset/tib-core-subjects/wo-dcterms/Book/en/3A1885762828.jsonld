            "abstract": "The theme of \u2018Managing the digital transformation of the construction industry\u2019 emphasises the importance of considering various dimensions of digitalisation and optimising the built environment. This review aims to present methodological approaches from existing literature that elucidate location-related factors impacting the capital cost of data centres. These findings facilitate adjustments to historical cost data when estimating total costs for new data centres. A systematic literature review method was employed to ensure an objective and comprehensive synthesis. In conjunction with Bayes's theory, this review identifies that a Delphi methodology is the most suitable methodological approach for forecasting and modelling capital expenditure for hyper-scale data centres. The methodology enables collective decision-making and consensus building, recognising the stakeholder's pivotal role in shaping the future of data centres. These findings offer valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in forming a methodological approach for further investigations into the location-related factors impacting the capital cost of data centres. Embracing this knowledge allows us to align research and practice, ensuring that these practices become integral to shaping the future of data centres and the digitalisation and optimisation of the built environment",

                "\"The movement away from teacher-centred toward student-centred learning and teaching (SCLT) in higher education has intensified in recent decades. Yet, in spite of its widespread use in literature and policy documents, SCLT remains somewhat poorly defined, under-researched and often misinterpreted. Against this backdrop, The Routledge Handbook of Student-Centred Learning and Teaching in Higher Education offers an original, comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the fundamentals of SCLT and its discussion and applications in policy and practice. Bringing together 70 scholars from around the world, the volume provides examples of good practice that display how instructional expertise manifests itself, and critically discusses challenges, new directions and developments in pedagogy, course and study program design, and classroom practice and assessment. Including reviews of theoretical, conceptual, methodological issues and case study examples, each chapter also considers implications for implementing SCLT across various contexts in higher education. An essential resource, this book uniquely offers researchers, educators and students in higher education new\"--",

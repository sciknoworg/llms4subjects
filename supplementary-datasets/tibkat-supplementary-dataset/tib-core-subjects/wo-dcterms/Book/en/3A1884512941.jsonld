                "\"Each day in the US, more than 10,000 women and birthing people give birth.1 While most parents and infants remain healthy through this experience, each day about 136 people will have some severe complication, such as cardiac arrest, acute renal failure, sepsis, the need for a blood transfusion, or respiratory distress syndrome,2 and three people will die.3 More birthing people die because of pregnancy and childbirth in the US than in other comparable countries.4 Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic/Latina women have the highest rates of childbirth and pregnancy complications5 and are more likely to die compared with white women.3,6 These disparities are rooted at the intersection of racism, sexism, poverty, and other systems of oppression that lead to fewer opportunities, less access to resources and protections, increased stress, and poorer quality care. At one of the most vulnerable times in their lives, women and birthing people face inequities that perpetuate illness and disease. This is unacceptable\"--",
                "Since publishing 'The Practical Playbook II', there has been growing recognition of increased maternal deaths & poor maternal health outcomes disproportionately impacting Black, Indigenous, People of Color in the US. Practitioners are often unaware or unequipped to understand the inequities faced by historically marginalized populations in maternal health care. 'The Practical Playbook III' is a guide for researchers, community activists, & advocates of maternal health offering practical tools & strategies to improve inequities in maternal health. This volume aims to describe the need & opportunities for improving maternal health through multi-sector collaborations. It highlights examples of effective cross-sector partnerships that are making real improvements in health outcomes for maternal health populations & offers practical tools & strategies for practitioners working in this space."

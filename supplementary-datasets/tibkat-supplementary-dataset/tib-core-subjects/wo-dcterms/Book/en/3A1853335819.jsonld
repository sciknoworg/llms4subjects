            "abstract": "In Paraguay\u2019s Chaco region, cattle ranching drives some of the world\u2019s fastest deforestation and most extreme inequality in land tenure, with grave impacts on Indigenous well-being. Disrupting the Patr\u00f3n traces Enxet and Sanapan\u00e1 struggles to reclaim their ancestral lands from the cattle ranches where they labored as peons\u2014a decades-long resistance that led to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and back to the frontlines of Paraguay\u2019s ranching frontier. The Indigenous communities at the heart of this story employ a dialectics of disruption by working with and against the law to unsettle enduring racial geographies and rebuild territorial relations, albeit with uncertain outcomes. Joel E. Correia shows that Enxet and Sanapan\u00e1 peoples enact environmental justice otherwise: moving beyond juridical solutions to harm by maintaining collective lifeways and resistance amid radical social-ecological change. Correia\u2019s ethnography advances debates about environmental racism, ethics of engaged research, and Indigenous resurgence on Latin America\u2019s settler frontiers. \u201cA crucial and incisive contribution to our understanding of racialized geographies, settler capitalism, and environmental and Indigenous justice.\u201d \u2014 Gast\u00f3n R. Gordillo, author of Rubble: The Afterlife of Destruction \u201cFocusing on the racial and cultural implications of land and labor in Indigenous struggles in Paraguay, Correia expands our focus on environmental concerns to include human rights, cultural rights, and the need for legal and political justice.\u201d \u2014 Nancy Postero, author of The Indigenous State: Race, Politics, and Performance in Plurinational Bolivia \u201dA story of the underrepresented peoples of Paraguay, their endurance under multiple cycles of dispossession, and the various forms that their resistance takes.\u201d \u2014 Gabriela Valdivia, coauthor of Oil, Revolution, and Indigenous Citizenship in Ecuadorian Amazonia",

                "\"Rapid changes in communication technologies shifted the media environment from one of scarcity to one characterized by abundance. Advertisers are paying more and more money to reach fewer and fewer people, as audiences consume endless streams of content across different platforms. When you can no longer buy enough attention for advertising to remain efficient -- how do brands respond?Spanning communication theory, neuroscience, creativity and innovation, media history, popular culture, branding, and emerging technologies, Paid Attention explores how ideas move people and how advertising can and should change in response to changes in the communication landscape.Topics covered include: a critical look at market research, modern theories of communication, the vanishing difference between content, media, and advertising, what ideas are and how to get them, and the future of advertising.  \"--",
                "\"Spanning communication theory, neuroscience, creativity and innovation, media history, branding and emerging technologies, Paid Attention explores how ideas move people and how advertising can and should change in response to changes in the communications landscape. A modern model for how brands operate and innovate in the evolving market for ideas, it contains both beliefs that can guide behaviour and practical tools and examples to help account planners and strategists in their jobs and careers. Paid Attention provides a framework for brands and market research based on the emerging context of behavioural economics. It references a wide body of theory and praxis, from neuroscience, advertising research, behavioural economics, psychology, sociology, technology and even science fiction. Mapping advertising to a wider analysis of culture, it appeals to media scholars and anyone interested in today's media-saturated culture\"--"

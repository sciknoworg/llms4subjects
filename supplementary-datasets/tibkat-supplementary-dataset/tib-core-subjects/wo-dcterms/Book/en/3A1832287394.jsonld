            "abstract": "This book explains and discusses how a child's right to freedom of expression is upheld through practice and decision-making in Child Protection Services (CPS).   Using the right to expression as stipulated in Article 12.2 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) as a point of departure, it explains what CPS practices should look like and how they must operate to uphold and enforce the rights of the child by providing \"\"the opportunity to be heard\"\" in any administrative practice. Current research literature documents extensively, and across countries, how either the voice of the child is not heard or, alternatively, the existence of a pro forma/tokenistic approach to listening to the child throughout CPS practices. Taking a three-fold approach, this book   establishes a clearer connection between rights and professional practice according to Article 12    extrapolates how rights-based practice is achieved during CPS practices    provides a comprehensive answer to the challenge of implementing Article 12.2 through policy and legislation.    It will be of interest to all students, academic and professionals working within child protection including social workers, probation officers, health and social care workers, lawyers and teachers",

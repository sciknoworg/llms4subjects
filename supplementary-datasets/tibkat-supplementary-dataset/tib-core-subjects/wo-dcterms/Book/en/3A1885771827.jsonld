            "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has dramatically revolutionized ophthalmology in the clinical setting. It has become an indispensable tool for ophthalmologists, enabling them to visualize and diagnose several different ocular diseases. With the advent of OCT, the diagnosis and management of ocular diseases have become even more accurate, efficient, and patient friendly. A new generation of OCT technology with increased resolution and speed has been developed, achieving in vivo optical biopsy (i.e., visualization of tissue architectural morphology in situ and in real-time). Functional extensions of OCT technology enable noninvasive, depth-resolved functional assessment and tissue imaging. This comprehensive and richly illustrated guide enables the reader to identify the anatomy and ophthalmic pathologies illustrated by OCT. It is the most up-to-date book on OCT. All the major pathological areas of ophthalmology are covered, including macular degeneration, uveitis, glaucoma, vascular diseases, and glaucoma abnormalities, as well as other hot topics",

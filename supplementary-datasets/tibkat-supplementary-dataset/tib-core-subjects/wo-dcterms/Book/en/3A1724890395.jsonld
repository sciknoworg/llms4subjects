            "abstract": "The Central Bank of Chile (Banco Central de Chile, BCCh) and Chile's Ministry of Finance, requested the World Bank to undertake a stand-alone Review of Standards and Codes (ROSC) module of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO). A total of five financial market infrastructures (FMIs) were assessed as part of this ROSC, although one of these operates both as a central counterparty (CCP) and as a securities settlement system (SSS) for different segments of the exchange-traded securities market, and as a result a total of six FMI assessments were produced by the team. In addition, the Responsibilities of Authorities for FMIs were assessed. Other sources of information included the applicable laws and regulations, as well as each FMI's main policies and internal documents (e.g. detailed policies, and processes and procedures for certain key areas) which were shared by the FMIs with the assessors, and other information available at each FMI's website (e.g. statistics). The World Bank Group (WBG) and local teams also met with a number of users of these FMIs, including two large commercial banks and two brokers-dealers that are not part of local bank-lead conglomerates. This assessment report covers the Responsibilities of central banks, market regulators, and other relevant authorities for the above-mentioned financial market infrastructures. In addition, it has the detailed assessment report of Depsito Central de Valores S.A. (DCV)",

                "This book mainly explored the driving forces and evolvement of Myanmar\u2019s China policy since 1988 by adopting a neo-classical realist apporach, an emerging theoretical paradigm aiming at analyzing state\u2019s foreign behaviour by connecting systemic and unit variables which refers to external environments and domestic restraints respectively. It is the first book that seeks to give a theoretical explanation of Myanmar\u2019s diplomacy, thereby bridging the gap from basic research to the deep one with theories. It also introduced the concept of strategic preference and argued that the competing strategic preference that the Burmese leaders have, namely \u201cintegration\u201d and \u201cisolation\u201d, determines Myanmar\u2019s responses to China in the Post-Cold War era, which not only demonstrates the neo-classical realism as an useful instrument of looking into state\u2019s foreign policy and deepens the understanding on Myanmar-China relations. The main content of this book is divided into seven parts, in which the first chapter introduces the background, the present study on Myanmar\u2019s China policy and China\u2019s Myanmar policy, the analytical framework, and the arrangement of the content. Chapter 2 focuses on the roots and changes of Myanmar\u2019s competing strategic preference as well as its influences on Myanmar\u2019s foreign policy. The following four chapters examine the international pressures and benefits imposed by systemic imperatives, and Burmese leaders\u2019 specific strategic preference since 1988, and investigate Myanmar\u2019s policy towards China in different periods. Finally, it provides a comprehensive conclusion that outlines and reviews the origins and evolution of Myanmar\u2019s China policy, and predicts its future directions. This book is suitable for the graduates and experts who are interested in international relations, the Asian studies and neo-classical realism in particular, and Myanmar politics and foreign relations, as well as China\u2019s relation with neighboring countries. ."

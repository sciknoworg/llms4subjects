            "abstract": "Few articles in the humanities have had the impact of Lisa Jardine and Anthony Grafton\u2019s seminal \u2018Studied for Action\u2019 (1990), a study of the reading practices of Elizabethan polymath and prolific annotator Gabriel Harvey. Their excavation of the setting, methods and ambitions of Harvey\u2019s encounters with his books ignited the History of Reading, an interdisciplinary field which quickly became one of the most exciting corners of the scholarly cosmos. A generation inspired by the model of Harvey fanned out across the world\u2019s libraries and archives, seeking to reveal the many creative, unexpected and curious ways that individuals throughout history responded to texts, and how these interpretations in turn illuminate past worlds.  Three decades on, Harvey\u2019s example and Jardine\u2019s work remain central to cutting-edge scholarship in the History of Reading. By uniting \u2018Studied for Action\u2019 with published and unpublished studies on Harvey by Jardine, Grafton and the scholars they have influenced, this collection provides a unique lens on the place of marginalia in textual, intellectual and cultural history. The chapters capture subsequent work on Harvey and map the fields opened by Jardine and Grafton\u2019s original article, collectively offering a posthumous tribute to Lisa Jardine and an authoritative overview of the History of Reading",

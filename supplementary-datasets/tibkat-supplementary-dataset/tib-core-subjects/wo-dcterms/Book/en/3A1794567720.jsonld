            "abstract": "Recent years have seen a vast development in various methodologies for object detection and feature extraction and recognition, both in theory and in practice. When processing images, videos, or other types of multimedia, one needs efficient solutions to perform fast and reliable processing. Computational intelligence is used for medical screening where the detection of disease symptoms is carried out, in prevention monitoring to detect suspicious behavior, in agriculture systems to help with growing plants and animal breeding, in transportation systems for the control of incoming and outgoing transportation, for unmanned vehicles to detect obstacles and avoid collisions, in optics and materials for the detection of surface damage, etc. In many cases, we use developed techniques which help us to recognize some special features. In the context of this innovative research on computational intelligence, the Special Issue \u201cAdvanced Computational Intelligence for Object Detection, Feature Extraction and Recognition in Smart Sensor Environments\u201d present an excellent opportunity for the dissemination of recent results and achievements for further innovations and development. It is my pleasure to present this collection of excellent contributions to the research community.     - Prof. Marcin Wo\u017aniak, Silesian University of Technology, Poland \u2013",

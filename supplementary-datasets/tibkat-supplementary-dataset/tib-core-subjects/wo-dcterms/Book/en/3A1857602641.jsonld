It provides a broad coverage of the theory behind emerging technology, material development, functional characterization, and technical details required to investigate the novel applications and methods and put them to use. The handbook presents experimental breakthroughs of novel methodologies that treat additively manufactured parts, which are suitable for demanding engineering applications. This handbook emphasizes the various types of post-processing technologies that can effectively eliminate the inferiorities of the additively manufactured components. It also provides a collection of key principles, literature, methodologies, experimental results, case studies, and the theoretical aspects of the different types of post-processing techniques along with different classes of materials and end applications. This book is an ideal reference for libraries and post-graduate courses as well as the professional market including, but not limited to manufacturing, mechanical, industrial engineering, and materials science\"--",

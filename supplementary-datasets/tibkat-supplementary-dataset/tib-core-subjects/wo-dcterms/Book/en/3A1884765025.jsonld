            "abstract": "\"Explore the intriguing world of photocatalysis with Introduction to Photocatalysis: Fundamentals and Applications. This book explores the complexities of photocatalytic processes, investigating the contributing elements, nano-photocatalyst manufacturing methodologies, and their wide applications in the energy and environmental sectors. Additionally, sophisticated modification approaches that may be used to improve the efficiency of visible light-driven processes (such as doping and plasmonics photocatalysis) are discussed. Key features include novel methodologies of photocatalysts, providing an insight on fundamentals and methodology; and examples of efficient applications of photocatalysis such as wastewater treatment, hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. Later chapters discuss the commercial aspects of photocatalysis to help guide future entrepreneurs. The book is useful for advanced undergraduates, and graduate students in a range of subjects such as physics, biotechnology, and biochemistry. This book will also prove invaluable for researchers and scientists in photocatalysis, and chemical engineers and chemists in industry R&D working on wastewater treatment and renewable sources of energy. It stands out as a modernized version of current literature that bridges the gap between scholars and students\"--",

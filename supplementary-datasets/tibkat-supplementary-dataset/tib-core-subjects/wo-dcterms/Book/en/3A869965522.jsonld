The essays selected for inclusion in Explorations and Encounters in French bring together many of the current research strands in French Studies today, tapping into current pedagogical trends, analysing contemporary events in France, examining the Franco-Australian past, while reviewing teaching practice and the culture of teaching.Collectively, the essays reflect the common engagement with language, culture and society that characterizes the community of French teachers and scholars in Australia and abroad",

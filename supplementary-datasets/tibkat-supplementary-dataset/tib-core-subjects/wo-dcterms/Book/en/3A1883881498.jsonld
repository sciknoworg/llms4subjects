            "abstract": "This book provides a comprehensive overview of the latest trends in Internet of Things (IoT) antenna design. IoT is a rapidly growing network of interconnected devices that can collect and exchange data. This data can be used to improve efficiency, safety, and productivity in many applications, including smart cities, grids, industrial internet, computer security, etc. One of the main components of the IoT is the antenna. Antennas are responsible for transmitting and receiving the data that flows between IoT devices. To be effective, IoT antennas must be small, light, and easy to integrate into devices. They must also be able to operate in various environments, including those with elevated interference levels. This resource covers a wide range of topics, including the challenges and opportunities involved in designing antennas for IoT applications and the importance of miniaturization in IoT antenna design. A comprehensive list of references is included, making it a valuable resource for further study. This is an essential resource for engineers, researchers, and anyone who wants to learn more about the latest trends in IoT antenna design",

                "Engineering Mechanics is one of the fundamental branches of science which is important for the education of professional engineers regardless of major. Most of the basic engineering courses, such as mechanics of materials, fluid and gas mechanics, machine design, mechatronics, acoustics and vibrations, etc., are based on the Engineering Mechanics course. In order to absorb the materials of Engineering Mechanics, it is not enough to just consume theorems and theoretical laws. A student also must develop an ability to solve practical problems. Therefore, it is necessary to solve many problems independently. The books in this series are designed as supplements to the Engineering Mechanics course and can be used to apply the principles required for solving practical engineering problems in the following branches of Mechanics: Statics, Kinematics, Dynamics, and Advanced Kinetics. Each book contains several (between 6 and 8) topics of the branch. Each topic has 30 problems to be assigned as homework, tests, and midterm/final exams with the consent of the instructor. A solution of one similar sample problem from each topic is provided. This fourth book in the series contains eight topics of Advanced Kinetics, which is the branch of Mechanics that is concerned with the analysis of motion of both particles and rigid bodies with reference to the cause of the motion. This book is targeted to undergraduate students of the junior/senior level as well as graduate students majoring in science and engineering",

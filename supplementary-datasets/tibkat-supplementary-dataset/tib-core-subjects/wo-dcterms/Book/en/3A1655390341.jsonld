                "This outline of statistics as an aid in decision making will introduce a reader with limited mathematical background to the most important modern statistical methods. This is a revised and enlarged version, with major extensions and additions, of my \"Angewandte Statistik\" (5th ed.), which has proved useful for research workers and for consulting statisticians. Applied statistics is at the same time a collection of applicable statistical methods and the application of these methods to measured and/or counted observations. Abstract mathematical concepts and derivations are avoided. Special emphasis is placed on the basic principles of statistical formulation, and on the explanation of the conditions under which a certain formula or a certain test is valid. Preference is given to consideration of the analysis of small sized samples and of distribution-free methods. As a text and reference this book is written for non-mathematicians, in particular for technicians, engineers, executives, students, physicians as well as researchers in other disciplines. It gives any mathematician interested in the practical uses of statistics a general account of the subject. Practical application is the main theme; thus an essential part of the book consists in the 440 fully worked-out numerical examples, some of which are very simple; the 57 exercises with solutions; a number of different compu\u00ad tational aids; and an extensive bibliography and a very detailed index. In particular, a collection of 232 mathematical and mathematical-statistical tables serves to enable and to simplify the computations.",

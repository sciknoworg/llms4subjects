            "abstract": "\"Quantum mechanics is one of the most successful scientific theories ever developed and is responsible for the vast majority of modern technology including computers and smartphones, lasers and telecommunications and magnetic resonance imaging. In its most basic form, quantum mechanics tells us that at the microscopic level, matter can behave both as a particle and as a wave. Such a simple concept leads to a fundamental shift in our understanding of how the world works. The identification of Mathematical Physics as a distinct discipline at the University of Edinburgh can be traced back to 1922. Since then, notable physicists such as Charles Galton Darwin, Max Born, Nick Kemmer and Peter Higgs (to mention a few) have taught this program and contributed not only to its high-quality teaching but also to developing and updating course lecture notes. Today, as the current custodians of the Quantum Mechanics course, we have taken this accumulated knowledge of teaching this course and turned it into this textbook, whose key features are: 1. The inclusion of key, modern chapters on Symmetries in Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Entanglement, as well as an extensive chapter on Scattering. 2. The introduction of Dirac notations from the beginning to explain complex equations. 3. The adoption of a modern approach to introducing quantum mechanics via the mathematical underpinnings (Hilbert spaces, linear operators, etc.) 4. Detailed in-text examples and numerous end-of-chapter problems, which will enable students to better understand and practice the concepts discussed\"--",

            "abstract": "The Asia-Pacific has become the Indo-Pacific region as the US, Japan, Australia and India have decided to join forces and scale-up their political, economic and security cooperation. The message coming from Washington, Tokyo, Canberra and New Delhi is clear: China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is no longer the only game in town and Beijing\u2019s policymakers better get ready for fierce competition. Japan\u2019s ongoing and future \u201cquality infrastructure\u201d policies and investments in the Indo-Pacific in particular make it very clear that Tokyo wants a (much) bigger slice of the pie of infrastructure investments in the region. China\u2019s territorial expansionism in the South China Sea and its increasing interests and presence in countries in South Asia have done their share to help the four aforesaid countries expand their security and defence ties. Beijing, of course, smells containment in all of this and it probably has a point.Who will have the upper hand in shaping and defining Asian security",

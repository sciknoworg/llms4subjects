The underlying concept was to focus o the creative community, which was becoming increasingly sidelined due to the city's prohibitive real estate costs. It was our hope, as a non-profit institution, that we could provide a welcoming and encouraging venue for creative producers while a the same time accessing new audiences by offering a new kind of art space in a neighborhood that was not well-served by institutions and by bringing New York's dedicated museum-goers to East Williamsburg by showing the kind of art that isn't shown anywhere else in the city\"-- From text",

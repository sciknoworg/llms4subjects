                "This book will help managers thrive in the ever-evolving workplace.Many managers are poorly equipped to succeed in the years to come because their knowledge base is too narrow and the environment they must operate in is becoming too complex. They are fed insights and facts on ever-narrow topics at work, through business publications, and often at university. Their world is becoming so complex that they need to broaden their appreciation for how business is evolving in ways that are normally considered. The primary objective of this book is to make readers-primarily managers-aware of the critical features of the evolving workplace in which they must succeed. A second objective is to define many of the behavioral attributes managers need to thrive in the evolving environment described in the book.Some other important objectives that will optimize the role of managers in the present and future workplace are included such as:. Discusses the evolution of management as a profession over the past two decades and how it is continuing to evolve. Presents a new management style and makes recommendations for what today's managers must know and how to work. Relying on history and observations of current trends, this book describes the context in which we work and the obvious and some not-so obvious implications, making recommendations on how management should function. Offers ways to think about your role as manager so that you can optimize your effectiveness in what many consider to be rather turbulent and uncertain changes in the profession of management. Cortada utilizes his breadth of managerial experience to define the needs of the current and future workplace that are constantly reshaping due to economic globalization and the cumulative effects of the infusion of digital technologies and telecommunications"

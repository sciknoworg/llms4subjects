            "abstract": "This book offers the first full-length study of Charlotte Smith\u2019s Elegiac Sonnets and clarifies its \u2018place\u2019 \u2013 in multiple ways \u2013 in literary history as a work celebrated for \u2018making it new\u2019, yet deeply engaged with the literary past. It argues that Smith\u2019s sonnets are constituted by three intertwined concerns: with tradition, place and the sonnet form itself, whereby the subjects of Smith\u2019s sonnets \u2013 across birds, rivers, the sea, plants and flowers \u2013 are bound up with the literary context in which she wrote. Charlotte Smith and the Sonnet shows that Smith\u2019s verse engages more deeply with tradition than has hitherto been realised and revises our understanding not only of Smith\u2019s career but also of the sonnet in eighteenth-century England. The book also illuminates Smith\u2019s place in posterity, as a popular poet \u2013 influencing figures ranging from Wordsworth and Coleridge to Constable \u2013 who was subsequently obscured in literary history. It reveals the complex processes underpinning Smith\u2019s reception and paradoxical position from the late eighteenth century to the present day, and shows that the appropriation of place itself was an important way in which aspects of literary tradition have been negotiated and understood by Smith, her predecessors, contemporaries and successors",

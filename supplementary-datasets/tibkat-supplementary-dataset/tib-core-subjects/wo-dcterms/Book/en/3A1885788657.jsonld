            "title": "The Strategic Corporal revisited : Challenges facing combatants in 21st\u2011century warfare",
            "abstract": "As we enter an era of multidimensional warfare, and technological innovations continue to accelerate the pace of war, the importance of decisions made by junior military leaders \u2014 some of them with strategic impact \u2013 continues to grow exponentially. US Marine Corps General Charles C. Krulak coined the term \u2018The Strategic Corporal\u2019 nearly two decades ago, and it is more relevant today than ever. This book is the first scholarly analysis of the challenges facing Strategic Corporals \u2013 and those who seek to prepare and equip them \u2013 in the 21st century. The topics addressed include leadership and education, military culture, peacekeeping, counterinsurgency, cyber warfare, and private military contractors and NGOs in the contemporary battlespace. Also included is a historian\u2019s reflection on General Krulak\u2019s development of the \u2018Strategic Corporal\u2019 concept, and a practitioner\u2019s response to the scholarly arguments contained in the book. This book will be of interest to scholars of contemporary security and armed conflict as well as practitioners who are, or serve alongside, today\u2019s Strategic Corporals",

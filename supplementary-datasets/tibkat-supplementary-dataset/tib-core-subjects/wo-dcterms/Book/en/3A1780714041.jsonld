                "The main focus of this book is presenting practical procedures for improving learning effectiveness using note taking activities during e-learning courses. Although presentation of e-learning activities recently has been spreading to various education sectors, some practical problems have been discussed such as evaluation of learning performance and encouragement of students. The authors introduce note taking activity as a conventional learning tool in order to promote individual learning activity and learning efficacy. The effectiveness of note taking has been measured in practical teaching in a Japanese university using techniques of learning analytics, and the results are shown here. The relationships between note taking activity and students\u2019 characteristics, the possibility of predicting the final learning performance using metrics of students\u2019 note taking, and the effectiveness for individual emotional learning factors are evaluated. Some differences between blended learning and fully online learning courses are also discussed. The authors provide novel analytical procedures and ideas to manage e-learning courses. In particular, the assessment of note taking activity may help to track individual learning progress and to encourage learning motivation."

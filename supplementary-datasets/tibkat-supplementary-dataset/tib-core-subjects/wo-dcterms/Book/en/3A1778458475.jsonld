            "abstract": "The Special Issue Distributed Energy Resources Management 2018 includes 13 papers, and is a continuation of the Special Issue Distributed Energy Resources Management. The success of the previous edition shows the unquestionable relevance of distributed energy resources in the operation of power and energy systems at both the distribution level and at the wider power system level. Improving the management of distributed energy resources makes it possible to accommodate the higher penetration of intermittent distributed generation and electric vehicle charging. Demand response programs, namely the ones with a distributed nature, allow the consumers to contribute to the increased system efficiency while receiving benefits. This book addresses the management of distributed energy resources, with a focus on methods and techniques to achieve an optimized operation, in order to aggregate the resources namely in the scope of virtual power players and other types of aggregators, and to remunerate them. The integration of distributed resources in electricity markets is also addressed as an enabler for their increased and efficient use",

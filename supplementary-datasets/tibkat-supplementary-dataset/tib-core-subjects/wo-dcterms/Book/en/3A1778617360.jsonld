            "title": "New Applications of Electric Drives",
            "abstract": "In the last few decades, electric drives have found their place in a considerable number of diverse applications. They are successfully replacing some other traditional types of drives owing to their better performance and excellent controllability. The introduction of electric drives is in most cases also beneficial from the ecological point of view as they are not directly dependent on fossil fuels and an increasing part of electric energy they consume is generated in renewable energy sources. This book focuses on applications of electric drives that emerged only recently and/or novel aspects that appear in them. Particular attention is given to using electric drives in vehicles, aircraft, non-road mobile machinery, and HVAC systems",

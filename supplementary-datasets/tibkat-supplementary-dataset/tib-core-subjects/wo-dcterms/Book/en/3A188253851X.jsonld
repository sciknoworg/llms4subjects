            "abstract": "\"This book describes the foundations of energy resources and includes most of the important aspects and relevant issues of conventional and non-conventional energy sources. It thoroughly explains the facets of energy conversion processes from food waste, including comparative analyses, benefits, and challenges associated with building an energy system that uses food waste as its primary input. It also provides an example of contemporary grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system control methods. Subsequently, it describes the transient stability of the DC microgrid which has been investigated whenever any voltage and load change creates an imbalance in active power. Afterwards it shows the implementation of control algorithms for the microgrid powered by hybrid energy sources with the main objective of the energy management control. It also shows the integrated energy management systems used to control the demand of power supply to the end users. Integrated energy management systems will be significant and reliable in the future. It also presents multi-objective optimal power flow solution with wind power integrated conventional power systems. It also describes the amalgamation of renewable energy systems in the existing grid system which is the main cause of instability and equilibrium issues. Lastly, it ends with the discussion of different energy storage schemes and the control and management for proper utilization of energy\"--",

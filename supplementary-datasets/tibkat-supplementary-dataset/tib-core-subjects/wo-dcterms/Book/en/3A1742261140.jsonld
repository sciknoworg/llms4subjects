Title includes the names of Cutlip and Center in honor of their contribution to the field. Beginning with the first edition in 1952, Effective Public Relations (EPR) has introduced the theory and principles of public relations, schooled its practitioners, and served as a reference for those in the calling worldwide. Scott M. Cutlip and Allen H. Center created the book that made public relations education an academic area of study on university and college campuses, and gave the practice a foundation of knowledge and principles. Many of their ideas and ambitions in the early editions still serve as beacons leading public relations education and practice. Public relations education and professional practice now extend well beyond the limits of a single book or course, yet EPR remains the basic reference for the field worldwide. It is the book most frequently used by those preparing for accreditation exams, most frequently cited in public relations literature, most widely used worldwide in English, and most translated for study in China, Japan, Russia, Korea Spain, Bulgaria, Italy, and Latvia.",

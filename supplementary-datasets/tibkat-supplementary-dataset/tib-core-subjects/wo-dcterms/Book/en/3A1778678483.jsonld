            "title": "Brain damage : bridging between basic research and clinics",
            "abstract": "\"Brain Damage - Bridging Between Basic Research and Clinics\" represents a collection of papers in an attempt to provide an up-to-date approach to the fascinating topic of brain damage in different pathological situations, combining the authors' personal experiences with current knowledge in this field. In general, the necessary link between basic and clinical neurosciences is highlighted, as it is through this interaction that the theoretical understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms can be successfully translated into better ways to diagnose, treat and prevent the catastrophic events that occur when the brain suffers from external or internal noxious events. The book spans different aspects of brain injury, starting from damage occurring in the fetal and child brain, followed by different neurodegenerative processes. Attention is also focused on the negative effects of drug addictions and sleep deprivation on the brain, as well as on the early assessment of brain injury for preventive strategies employing sensitive biomarkers",

            "abstract": "Japan\u2019s Failed Revolution: Koizumi and the Politics of Economic Reform asks why, despite all the high expectations, the Japanese public\u2019s desire for economic reform, and leadership of a majority coalition in a parliamentary democracy, the reformer Prime Minister Koizumi has not achieved the economic reforms expected of him since he surprisingly attained power over a year ago. To unravel this \u2018puzzle\u2019, Aurelia George Mulgan eschews the simplicities of both cultural and rational choice explanations and systematically tests the propositions in the comparative literature on \u2018failed reform\u2019. The result is one of the best books ever written about contemporary Japanese politics. It explains how, despite British-style parliamentary institutions, Japan\u2019s very \u2018un-Westminster\u2019 traditional policymaking process involving the ruling party and the bureaucracy\u2019s structure and linkage has stymied and will probably continue to stymie even a sincere and active Prime Minister\u2019s best reform intentions. This book should be read by all political scientists, journalists, economists, and students interested in contemporary Japan. Ellis S. Krauss  Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies  University of California, San Diego.  The author takes a scalpel to dissect Japan\u2019s dysfunctional political system. She shows with wonderful clarity and depth of knowledge why the Koizumi reforms are not succeeding, and why revolutionary political change is needed as a precondition for economic recovery. The book should be required reading for anyone involved with contemporary Japan.  J.A.A. Stockwin  University of Oxford",

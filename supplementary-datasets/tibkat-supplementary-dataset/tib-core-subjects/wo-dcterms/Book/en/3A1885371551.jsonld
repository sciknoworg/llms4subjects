                "This book collects selected contributions of the \u201cOptimization and Decision Science - ODS2023\u201d international conference on the theme of optimization in green sustainability and ecological transition. ODS2023 was held in Ischia, 4\u20137 September 2023, and was organized by AIRO, the Italian Operations Research Society. The book offers new and original contributions on operations research, optimization, decision science, and prescriptive analytics from both a methodological and applied perspectives with a special focus on SDG related topics. It provides a state-of-the art on problem models and solving methods to address a widely class of real-world problems, arising in different application areas such as logistics, transportation, manufacturing, health, ICT and mobile networks, and emergency/disaster management. In addition, the scientific works collected in this book aim at providing significant contributions in the themes of sustainability, traffic and pollution reductions, and energy management. This book is aimed primarily at researchers and Ph.D. students in the Operations Research community. However, due to its interdisciplinary contents, this book is of high interest also for students and researchers from other disciplines, including artificial intelligence, computer sciences, finance, mathematics, and engineering as well as for practitioners facing complex decision-making problems in logistics, manufacturing production, and services.",
                "Preface -- OR in Healthcare: in this chapter we expect to propose works focusing on the use of operations research techniques in health care -- OR in Logistics: in this chapter we expect to propose works focusing on several logistic problems, e.g., supply chain, city logistics, port management -- OR in Transportation: in this chapter we expect to propose works which focus is on transportation problems involving both transportation of people and freight -- Optimization and Data Science: in this chapter we expect to propose contributions focusing on several aspects of data science -- Network Flows: in this chapter we expect to propose contributions focusing on theoretical and practical issues emerging in network optimization problems -- Combinatorial Optimization: in this chapter we expect to propose contributions focusing on theoretical and practical issues emerging in combinatorial optimization problems."

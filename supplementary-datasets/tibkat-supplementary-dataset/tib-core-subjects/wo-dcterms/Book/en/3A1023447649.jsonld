                "This authoritative research review provides a broad overview of the role that family firms, both those publicly listed and privately held, play in the global economy. The editors have selected seminal papers which investigate how the family business model affects firm performance and corporate decision making, and contribute to disentangling the interrelations that exist between family control of corporations and other governance mechanisms. Given the relevance of corporate governance and family firms for the economy and society as a whole, the present collection constitutes a point of reference for family business researchers, practitioners and policymakers alike. A better understanding of family firms is of paramount importance because these companies are the main drivers of economic growth all over the world. This title, with an original introduction by the editors, will be an excellent source of reference for students, practitioners and researchers in the field of governance and family firms"

                "This work provides researchers with a thorough overview of all aspects related to the development of gluten-free food products. In summarizing and offering critical reviews of published works and focusing on current advances and technologies in gluten free product development, this book covers all of the important subjects related to this increasingly important aspect of the food industry. Important case studies in gluten-free breadmaking and alternative proteins are presented, making this a rich and singular source for food manufacturers and scientists seeking practical knowledge on the challenges and solutions involved in the development of gluten-free foods. Challenges and Potential Solutions in Gluten Free Product Development covers the latest advances and strategies for gluten-free diets including the important nutritional factors involved. Traditional and alternative approaches for the development of gluten-free dough, including starch applications and microbial fermentations, are extensively covered. Alternative proteins including those from vegetables, cereals, legumes and eggs are presented. Novel approaches for gluten-free breadmaking such as aeration strategies, prebiotics, hydrocolloids and nutritional enhancements are also covered in depth. With further chapters dedicated to regulatory aspects, gluten detection methods and the global market, this book presents full and up-to-date coverage of the development and manufacture of gluten-free products."

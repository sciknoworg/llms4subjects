                "This book sheds light on the practice, challenges, and prospects of the Responsibility to Protect (RtoP) amidst wide contestation, backlash, operational challenges, and expectation gaps associated with the theory and practice of the RtoP. Diverging from existing works, it provides a renewed perspective and alternatives for future deployment of the RtoP and critical insights to the readers on how issues such as support, consolidation, and institutionalization within the broader context of regional dynamics of the RtoP can be best achieved in Africa. The book will be of particular interest to diplomats, international relations experts, scholars, RtoP advocates, the United Nations, and the African Union.

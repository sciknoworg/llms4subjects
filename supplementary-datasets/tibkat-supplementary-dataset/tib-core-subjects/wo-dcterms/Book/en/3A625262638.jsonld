                "\"Applied Gas Dynamics introduces the science and technology of gas dynamics, beginning with the definition of the subject (Gas Dynamics is a science of fluid flow where both density and temperature changes associated with the flow are significant) and introduces the three essential process of this science, namely, the isentropic process, shock and expansion process, and Fanno and Rayleigh flows, in such a manner that any beginner can follow the subject comfortably. This text is developed covering both theoretical and application aspects of Gas Dynamics. The coverage begins with the basic features of the flow physics and moves to advanced topics of devices involving internal and external flows such as thrust producing rocket nozzles and lift generating aerofoils. The physics of flows with significant changes in both density and temperature are discussed highlighting their theory and application throughout the book. At every stage appropriate practical examples are given to emphasizing the application of the theory, as are exercise problems with answers at the end of every chapter. Isentropic, normal shock, oblique shock and Fanno and Rayleigh Tables are given in the appendix.</span></span>\"--",

            "abstract": "\"As the global community confronts challenges in energy, environment, health, agriculture, industry, and construction, the significance of sustainable materials becomes paramount. The looming specter of resource depletion necessitates a paradigm shift, urging researchers and engineers to anticipate future needs and forge materials that align with evolving requirements. Next Generation Materials for Sustainable Engineering underscores the urgency of conserving resources and provides a blueprint for achieving this through judicious and sustainable use.From polymers to alloys, nanocomposites to biomaterials, this book traverses the expansive landscape of materials, deciphering their structures and properties with an eye toward sustainability. The relentless pursuit of innovation in synthesis protocols takes center stage, unveiling pathways to creating novel materials. The chapters dedicated to specific material applications, such as spintronics, nanowires, phase change materials, and nanocomposites, offer a detailed panorama of the latest advancements. This book bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical applications by exploring materials for renewable energy, electronic devices, artificial photosynthesis, lithium-sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, and biomedical applications. The book serves as a beacon for academicians, researchers, and material scientists, guiding them through state-of-the-art developments, emerging trends, and challenges in material science and engineering.\"--",

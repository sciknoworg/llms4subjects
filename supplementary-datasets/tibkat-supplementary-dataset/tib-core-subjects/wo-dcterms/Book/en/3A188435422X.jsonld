                "This open access book provides a comprehensive review of technological innovation in China, focusing on some existing challenges and the debate on the role of public policies in promoting innovation. Technological innovation has become a vital factor in promoting high-quality development in China. By examining the current state of and challenges confronting China's technological innovation from both the supply side (talent and R&D) and the demand side (domestic and international demand), this book offers a view on how to enhance the efficiency of industry chain while ensuring security through innovation. Public policy often plays a crucial role in shaping and improving the national innovation system when new challenges emerge. We put special emphasis on innovation in strategically important sectors, which include the digital, green, and biotech industries, as well as the manufacturing and logistics sectors that are fundamental to the working of the whole innovation system. This book explains academically rigorous content in a simple manner, and is therefore suitable for readers from the fields of public policy, economics, finance, and innovative sectors who seek to better understand China\u2019s path of innovation. The book cites information from various credible sources, including academic journals, policy institutions, and a network of primary sources such as industry experts and renowned academics."

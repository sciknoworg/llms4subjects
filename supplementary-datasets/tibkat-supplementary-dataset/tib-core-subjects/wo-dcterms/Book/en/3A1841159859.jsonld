            "abstract": "Both in the field of manufacturing and architecture, the art of paper folding (origami) is often taken as a reference for its kinetic properties and its elegant appearance. Dynamic facades, fast deployment structures, temporary shelters, portable furniture, and retractile roofs, are only a few of a vast variety of examples that can take advantage of theories proper of origami art. However, the available applications typically used by architects and designers are usually missing tools to aid the design of foldable mechanisms. Thus, this book addresses different strategies to narrow the gap between the potentialities of this discipline and the limits of the most used informatics tools, by proposing a synthetic parametric constructive approach, which allows designers with no background in math and scripting to deal with design problems typical of origami, such as folding simulations, rigid foldability, one degree of freedom motion, origami thickening, developability checking and more.  Riccardo Foschi is Research Fellow, and Adjunct Professor at the University of Bologna. PhD in 2019 on origami design strategies for architecture and manufacturing. His academic research spaces between all aspects of digital representation: VR, 3D modeling, 3D survey, algorithmic/parametric modeling, digital reconstruction of unbuilt or lost cultural heritage, applied origami, descriptive geometry. He is also an origami artist internationally renowned",

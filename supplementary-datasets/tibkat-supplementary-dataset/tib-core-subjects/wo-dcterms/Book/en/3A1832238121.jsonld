            "abstract": "About the publication This Compendium contains key documents relating to human rights adopted by the African Union (including NEPAD) and its predecessor, the Organization of African Unity. It also includes a selection of decisions and resolutions of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.  For the third edition the Compendium has been updated to May 2007. The earlier editions have been widely used by judges, lawyers, civil servants, NGOs and academics alike, in Africa and abroad who have an interest in the African human rights system. It has been published in French and Arabic, and will also be published in Portuguese.  This publication of the Centre for Human Rights of the University of Pretoria, South Africa, aims at making the human rights documents of the African Union more accessible and as such increase their impact.  About the editors:  Christof Heyns is Professor of Human Rights Law and Director of the Centre for Human Rights, University of Pretoria.  Magnus Killander is a researcher at the Centre for Huma Rights, University of Pretoria and is also the co-editor of African Human Rights Law Reports",

In Stable Radicals: Fundamentals and Applied Aspects of Odd-Electron Compounds a team of international experts provide a broad-based overview of stable radicals, from the fundamental aspects of specific classes of stable neutral radicals to their wide range of applications including synthesis, materials science and chemical biology. Topics covered include:  triphenylmethyl and related radicals  polychlorinated triphenylmethyl radicals: towards multifunctional molecular materials phenalenyls, cyclopentadienyls, and other carbon-centered radicals the nitrogen oxides:  persistent radicals and van der Waals complex dimers nitroxide radicals: properties, synthesis and applications the only stable organic sigma radicals: di-tert-alkyliminoxyls. Delocalized radicals containing the hydrazyl [R2N-NR] unit  metal-coordinated phenoxyl radicals stable radicals containing the thiazyl unit: synthesis, chemical, and materials properties stable radicals of the heavy p-block elements application of stable radicals as mediators in living-radical polymerization  nitroxide-catalyzed alcohol oxidations in organic synthesis metal-nitroxide complexes: synthesis and magneto-structural correlations rechargeable batteries using robust but redox-active organic radicals spin labeling: a modern perspective functional in vivo EPR spectroscopy and imaging using nitroxides and trityl radicals biologically relevant  chemistry of nitroxides.   Stable Free Radicals: Fundamentals and Applied Aspects of Odd-Electron Compounds is an essential guide to this fascinating area of chemistry for researchers and students working in organic and physical chemistry and materials science.\"--",

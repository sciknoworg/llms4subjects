            "abstract": "\u201cRandy Nandyatama offers a pathbreaking study of ASEAN\u2019s human rights turn, as seen through the lens of Indonesian civil society actors and human rights advocates. In his application of Bourdieu, he offers an innovative and ambitious approach to understanding human rights norms across the region, using the case of Indonesia to explore engagement practices among civil society organisations, and at the national and ASEAN regional levels. A highly recommended addition to the literature!\u201d \u2014 Assoc. Prof. Anthony J. Langlois, Flinders University, Australia \u201cConstructivist studies of ASEAN regionalism can be as state-centric as their realist counterparts. Randy Nandyatama offers a refreshing re-examination of that orthodoxy. Focusing on human rights advocacy by civil society organizations in Indonesia, Nandyatama\u2019s fascinating book explores their complex negotiations with the pre-existing \u2018doxa\u2019 in ASEAN regionalism\u2014the legal\u2013rational and socio[1]cultural norms of the \u201cASEAN Way\u201d\u2014that shape the conditions of normative and political possibility for human rights in Southeast Asia. I highly recommend it\u201d. \u2014 Professor See Seng Tan, S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore \u201cIndonesian democracy remains flawed as long as the human rights of its minority groups are threatened. Yet the book examines newer dynamics spurred by Indonesian CSO attempts at transnational advocacy\u2014in a region with an ambiguous relationship with human rights\u2014in especially when its principles infringe on the interests of states and powerful domestic actors. These dynamics are deciphered through detailed empirical analysis and distinctive use of a Constructivist IR approach influenced by Bourdieu\u2019s sociology\u201d. \u2014 Prof. Vedi Hadiz, University of Melbourne, Australia This book focuses on how Indonesian civil society organisations interact with ASEAN to shape human rights institutionalisation in the region. Using Bourdieu-inspired constructivist IR as an analytical lens, the book argues that there are pre-reflexive norms that dominate the field of interaction in the region that shape the way civil society organisations operate. This has resulted in the diverging advocacy practices, thus complicating human rights institutionalisation process in ASEAN. Randy W. Nandyatama is Assistant Professor in International Relations at Gadjah Mada University. .",

                "This textbook explores ethical issues for not-for-profit and non-governmental organizations, providing discussion-oriented cases for NFP and NGP practitioners. The book begins with an introduction to professional ethics as practiced in industry, not-for-profits and NGO\u2019s. Attention is paid both to classical ethical theories and contemporary variants. Then, combining that theory with an introduction to the morally unique facets of the NFP and NGO landscape, it offers a series of cases which pertain to the underlying theoretical substrate. The reader will find a blend of theory and application within the text as well as guided assignment prompts. Themes covered include board relationships, staff management, work with vulnerable populations, financial transparency, Human Resources ethics and ethical dilemmas unique to international operations. Craig Hanson, Ph.D. currently serves as Associate Professor and Director of the International Development program at Palm Beach Atlantic University, USA. He is an applied scholar and researcher with expertise at the intersection of philosophical ideas and the economy of human behavior. Using this expertise, he has engaged in a career of articulating new solutions to old problems in international development. He has lent his expertise to a large number of projects throughout the world \u2013 from Latin America to Southeast Asia \u2013 ranging from small faith-based endeavors to large public-private initiatives. A guiding principle of these activities has been the conviction that development requires more than just one focal point, be it religious, governmental, or in the private sector. Only through the effective intersection of these often competing sets of interests can forward progress be made in those places that need it most. He has lectured at institutions across the United States as well as Europe and Africa. He speaks, lectures, and writes in French and English and has conversational competence in a variety of other languages from Spanish to tribal languages of West Africa. He is currently engaged in a variety of projects related to the intersection of the public sector and private interests as well as the ever changing landscape of American Philanthropy.",

            "abstract": "\"The scope of this book is the improper or generalized Riemann integral and infinite sum (series). The reader will study its convergence, principal value, evaluation and application to science and engineering. Improper Riemann integrals and infinite sums are interconnected. In the new edition, the author has involved infinite sums more than he did in the first edition. Apart from having computed and listed a large number of improper integrals and infinite sums, we have also developed the necessary theory and various ways of evaluating them or proving their divergence. Questions, problems and applications involving various improper integrals and infinite sums (series) of numbers emerge in science and application very often. Their complete presentations and all rigorous proofs would require taking the graduate level courses on these subjects. Here their statements are adjusted to a level students of all levels can understand and use them efficiently as powerful tools in a large list of problems and applications\"--",

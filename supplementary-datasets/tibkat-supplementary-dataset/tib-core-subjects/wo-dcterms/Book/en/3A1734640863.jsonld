                "This book discusses Kazakhstan\u2019s transitioning trajectory to a market economy since it declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.. It analyses the evolution of key policy areas and sectors through the lens of policy development and implementation, and evaluates their suitability in pursuing the country\u2019s strategic objectives. Topics include policy initiatives for economic development, new policy paradigms in public service delivery and infrastructure improvement, and water-energy-food (WEF) nexus thinking in governing the WEF sectors. The book argues that policies developed in the 1990s and 2000s have so far served the nation\u2019s needs. Nevertheless, as Kazakhstan seeks to achieve a competitive edge worldwide, many of these policies would require adjustment, or a paradigm shift. Providing a unique outlook on policy and governance, this book will appeal to scholars, students, and practitioners involved with Kazakhstan and Central Asia and interested in the transformation of ex-Soviet nations, their policy, and sustainable development. Anastasia Koulouri is a Lecturer at the Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK. Previously she has held posts at the University of Strathclyde and Abertay University (UK), the Technical University of Helsinki (Finland), and the Belgian Nuclear Energy Research Centre (Belgium). She holds a PhD in Management Science from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK. Her research interests include energy policy and security in resource-rich countries with particular focus on Kazakhstan, and sustainable development of transitional economies. Dr Koulouri has co-edited volumes on Energy Security (Palgrave Macmillan 2019), and on the Water-Energy-Food Nexus (Routledge 2019). Nikolai Mouraviev is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Business, Law and Social Sciences, Abertay University, Dundee, Scotland, UK. Previously he has held teaching positions at KIMEP University (Kazakhstan); Wayne State University (US); and Viterbo University (US). Part of his research focuses on public-private collaboration in developing nations, and he has published extensively in this area including a monograph (Palgrave Macmillan 2017) and an edited volume (Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2017). In addition, his research interests include entrepreneurship and governance of the energy sector. Dr Mouraviev has co-authored six books, including two research monographs, and published more than 50 papers. ."

                "This book highlights established research and technology on corrosion inhibitors and bio-waste management. It further discusses emerging aspects of utilizing food waste in the field of corrosion inhibition. The topics covered include overview on bio-waste and their management, different types of food waste (i.e., agricultural, vegetable and fruit/fruit juice, plant waste, slaughterhouse trash), and their application as corrosion inhibitors and mitigation of corrosion. It also discusses economic aspects and commercialization of food waste as corrosion inhibitors. The book is a valuable reference for beginners, researchers, and professionals working in the areas of sustainability, food waste management, and material science."

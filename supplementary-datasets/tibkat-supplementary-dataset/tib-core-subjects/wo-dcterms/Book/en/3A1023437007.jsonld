                "'In an effort to move away from the usual negative approach of studying why women leave STEM areas, Bilimoria and Lord focus on a number of research studies across the United States, Australia and Europe that examine why women stay and what organizations and broader societal practices are doing to encourage women's career development. This exciting new volume has much to offer both academic researchers and practitioners in the field.'--Susan Vinnicombe OBE, Cranfield University, UK. 'Science and technology have become major contributors to our advancement and economic progress. But although more women than men now graduate from universities, women continue to face challenges in STEM fields such as engineering, mining, and university STEM teaching and research. Though progress is slowly being made, much more needs to be done. Diana Bilimoria and Linley Lord, along with their international contributors, address these concerns using theory and research evidence along with offering solutions. Organizational managers and government administrators interested in increasing women's participation and advancement in STEM disciplines need to examine this collection.'--Ronald J. Burke, York University, Canada. Adopting an international perspective, this book draws on current research from the United States, Australia and Europe to examine women's participation, advancement and leadership in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The book explores the nature of STEM careers across industry and academia, and presents the latest thinking on successful individual, organizational and educational initiatives related to women in STEM. Along with a select group of international contributors, Diana Bilimoria and Linley Lord provide a fresh perspective, based on success stories and successful initiatives, augmenting contemporary perspectives on the barriers and issues that women in STEM careers continue to face. Women in STEM Careers is a positive and insightful outlook on gender relations, which will be an invaluable resource for scholars, practitioners and policy-makers in organizations, human resources, academia, and government, as well as for women aspiring to or presently working in STEM fields"

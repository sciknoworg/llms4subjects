                "This work is closely tied to the renowned mathematics textbook series known as UNITEXT, tailored for university students pursuing bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees. What sets this particular book apart in the Springer collection is its unique origin: it has been crafted through a meticulous process involving interviews handled with and by world-class mathematicians. The content featured in this book revolve around a highly relevant and engaging topic: Optimal Transport. These conversations involve not only authors from the UNITEXT series, but also members of the series\u2019 Editorial Board. Additionally, they feature prominent figures in the field, including a Field Medalist. This work provides readers with a snapshot of remarkable vitality and freshness, guaranteed to captivate and engage anyone with an interest in mathematics. It\u2019s important to note that these interviews were initially shared as podcasts and originally broadcasted as online events on the Cassyni platform. Subsequently, advanced AI tools were employed under human supervision to transcribe the audios and edit them for better readability. A human copy-editor was involved during the whole process, and the authors revised the final copy-edited texts before publication. The content in each format \u2013 the interviews, the PODCASTS and the book \u2013 is self-contained and not a mere adaptation from one medium to another. Instead, it represents an independent exploration of the subject matter."

            "title": "Updates in Management of SARS-CoV-2 Infection",
            "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2011CoV\u20112) has spread worldwide from the beginning of 2020. The infection is mostly asymptomatic but some patients may develop COVID\u201119 (coronavirus disease 2019) with a severe or critical course leading to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. Apart from the virus\u2011related damage of the lungs, pathomechanism of the disease seems to be linked to thromboembolism and inflammation accompanied by overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, termed a cytokine storm, responsible for multiorgan damage and death. Since the development of a new therapeutic molecule, dedicated strictly to a particular virus is time\u2011consuming, physicians and scientists have started to test and repurpose old medications. Unfortunately, after one year of pandemics, there is still a lack of optimal therapy and no clear indicators of recovery. A major issue is also insufficient knowledge on predictors of the severe or deadly course of the disease, which could also help to switch from one therapeutic option to another. Due to many gaps still existing in the management of COVID-19, there is a need for the accumulation of new data particularly from real-world experience, which could be applicable to practice guidelines. The objective of this special issue of the Journal of Clinical Medicine is to provide an update on the mangement for the diagnostic workup and pharmacotherapy of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection",

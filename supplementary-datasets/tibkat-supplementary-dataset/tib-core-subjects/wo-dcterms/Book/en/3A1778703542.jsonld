            "title": "Arc Welding",
            "abstract": "Ever since the invention of arc technology in 1870s and its early use for welding lead during the manufacture of lead-acid batteries, advances in arc welding throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have seen this form of processing applied to a range of industries and progress to become one of the most effective techniques in metals and alloys joining. The objective of this book is to introduce relatively established methodologies and techniques which have been studied, developed and applied in industries or researches. State-of-the-art development aimed at improving technologies will be presented covering topics such as weldability, technology, automation, modelling, and measurement. This book also seeks to provide effective solutions to various applications for engineers and researchers who are interested in arc material processing. This book is divided into 4 independent sections corresponding to recent advances in this field",

            "abstract": "This work offers a summary of the book 'THE SEVEN-DAY WEEKEND: Finding The Work/Life Balance' by Ricardo Semler.Ricardo Semler is CEO of Brazil's Semco S.A., a 50-year old company with annual revenues exceeding $160 million.The 'seven-day weekend' is a metaphor for the fact it's now time to do things differently and better in the business world. Most of the practices which people so blindly accept as part of the business environment are not as absolutely essential as they may seem. In fact, most of these common practices have their roots in boarding school or military mentality.When you stop and ask some pointed questions, however, it soon becomes clear there must be a better way to get things done while harnessing the collective brainpower and intelligence of everyone involved. Some companies are starting to develop their own unique organization. One such company is Semco S.A.  In The Seven-Day Weekend, the author explains how Semco has found the right balance between work and personal life, not only for himself but also for his 3,000 employees.The Seven Day Weekend is filled with advice for businesspeople thinking of trying a new organization system within their company.",

            "abstract": "\"The academic community is currently facing the challenge of navigating the complexities of swarm robotics. This field demands understanding the design, control, and coordination of autonomous robotic swarms. The intricacies of developing algorithms that facilitate communication, cooperation, and adaptation among simple individual agents remain a formidable obstacle. Addressing issues like task allocation, formation control, path planning, and decentralized decision-making are pivotal to unlocking the true potential of swarm robotics.Bio-inspired Swarm Robotics and Control: Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Strategies immerses readers in the cutting-edge realm of swarm robotics, a discipline inspired by the intricate choreography observed in biological systems like insect colonies, bird flocks, and fish schools. Encompassing a rich array of bio-inspired algorithms, mechanisms, and strategies, the text elucidates how robots can communicate, cooperate, and adapt within dynamic environments. The book propels robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence advancements by fostering interdisciplinary connections and charting a course toward more efficient and resilient multi-robot systems. This book is ideal for biologists, engineers, and computer scientists to join forces in unlocking the full potential of swarm robotics.\"--",

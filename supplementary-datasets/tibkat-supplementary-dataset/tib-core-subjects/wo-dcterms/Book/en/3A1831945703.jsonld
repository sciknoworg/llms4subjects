            "abstract": "\"Elgar Research Agendas outline the future of research in a given area. Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. This timely Research Agenda provides a state-of-the-art review of existing research on manufacturing, as well as highlighting key areas of study to advance the field. Expert contributors from across the globe analyse the central role of manufacturing industries in the global economy, considering it as a multi-scalar process and assessing the impact of climate change in necessitating the decarbonization of production processes. Chapters identify and explore disruptive innovations in production technologies, including additive manufacturing, and their implications for future research. The book further highlights megatrends in automotive, electronics and emerging industries, including small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, Asian electronics production networks, global production networks, and operations and supply chain management. It develops a framework for accessing corporate elites and for guiding the process of undertaking qualitative semi-structured interviews. This Research Agenda will be a critical collection for economic geography, urban studies, city and regional planning, and business and management studies scholars seeking a forward-looking approach to the topic. It will also be useful to policymakers and practitioners working in regional economic development and planning\"--",

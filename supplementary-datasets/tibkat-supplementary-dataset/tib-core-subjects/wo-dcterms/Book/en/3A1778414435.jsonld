            "abstract": "\"In The Anguished and the Enchanted, M.H. Bowker offers a lengthy critical essay and richly annotated English translation of a lost Finnish translation of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s The Little Prince. Featuring a substantial Translator\u2019s Preface, M.H. Bowker develops a psychoanalytic lens through which to regard Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s classic work, offering a more nuanced and less \"\"fable-esque\"\" text than any translation and interpretation to date.  On Bowker\u2019s reading, dark and primitive unconscious forces \u2014 including neglect and abuse at home, the hatred of maturation and development, the projection of feelings of worthlessness onto others, the creation of an absurd and futile world, and more \u2014 infest the story, not unlike the Baobab trees dreaded by the little prince.  Those already familiar with The Little Prince will find in The Anguished and the Enchanted a new way of regarding what has perhaps become a favorite or even a beloved book. Those unfamiliar with the original work will discover a sometimes tragic, sometimes sympathetic, sometimes harrowing account of the lengths to which persons will go in their struggle to find \u2014 or to escape from \u2014 meaningful places for themselves in the world of adults.\"",

            "abstract": "In this series of lectures, delivered at Nanjing University from 2016 to 2019, Bernard Stiegler rethinks the so-called Anthropocene in relation to philosophy\u2019s failure to reckon with the manifold and indeed \u201ccosmic\u201d consequences of the entropic and thermodynamic revolution. Beginning with the Oxford Dictionaries\u2019 decision to make \u201cpost-truth\u201d the 2016 word of the year, and taking this as an opportunity to understand the implications for Heidegger\u2019s \u201chistory of being\u201d, \u201chistory of truth\u201d and Gestell, the first series of lectures enter into an original consideration of the relationship between Socrates and Plato (and of tragic Greece in general) and its meaning for the history of Western philosophy. The following year\u2019s lecture series traverse a path from Foucault\u2019s biopower to psychopower to neuropower, and then to a critique of neuroeconomics. Revising Husserl\u2019s account of retention to focus on the irreducible connection between human memory and technological memory, the lectures culminate in reflections on the significance of neurotechnology in platform capitalism. The concept of hyper-matter is introduced in the lectures of 2019 as requisite for an epistemology that escapes the trap of opposing the material and the ideal in order to respond to the need for a new critique of the notion of information and technological performativity (of which Moore\u2019s law both is and is not an example) in an age when the biosphere has become a technosphere",

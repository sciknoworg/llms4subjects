            "abstract": "This essay focuses on light and theories of combustion in the late 18th century. But it does so \u201con the nitrogen side\u201d: that is, on the side of those inert three-quarters of air that do not contribute to respiration and, therefore, do not trigger the light-emitting response of phosphorus in experiments. In analyzing the variety of opinions broadly (and imprecisely) ascribable to the \u201cLavoisierian-Phlogistonist\u201d dispute, this book sheds special light on the non-Lavoisierian German context where Johann Friedrich August G\u00f6ttling performed his tests on phosphorus and nitrogen \u2013 and, subsequently, on Lazzaro Spallanzani\u2019s crucial role in the debate. The book pays attention to theories, but it also deals with experimental practice. Therefore, it tells a story of procedures and instruments: in fact, it was especially on this tricky field that the understanding of the phosphorus-nitrogen relationship was achieved. In reading these pages, we shall meet the great heroes of early chemistry as well as the \u201cartisans of innovation\u201d who gave substantial contributions to the advancement of their discipline: a rich fresco that gives us a clear idea of the complexity of the methodological debate at the turn of the century, and of how widespread scientific activity was at that time",

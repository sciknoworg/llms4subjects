Inevitably then, development control is one of the most significant matters concerning anyone involved in the development of land, and an understanding of the Acts, legislations and enforcement of said powers is essential to the success of any development project.This book is the fourth edition of a highly regarded work widely used by students and practitioners of real estate management, development, surveying, valuation, planning and law. Written by two experienced experts on law and the UK planning system, Development and Planning Law is essential reading for anyone involved in building and construction, surveying, planning, and development and who need to know the law as it relates to their every day professional practice. It has been extensively updated to reflect the most recent legal developments, including the 2011 Localism Act\"--",

                "In the year 1999 the project of the inventarisation of the historic gardens in Austria, financed by the Austrian Science Fund FWF  was finished with the manuscript \u201cHistoric Gardens in Austria. Gardens and Parks from the Renaissance to 1930\u201d. Since 1984 this project was in charge of the author with some other co-workers at the Technical University of Vienna, Department of Landscape Planning and Garden History. This first Austrian inventory tended to consider public and private gardens, parks and artistically formed landscapes of all  nine Austrian states from the Renaissance to about 1930 in a systematic manner. In the years of the inventarisation over 1750 historic gardens and parks were discovered, photographed and described.

This first survey makes known the rich existence of historic garden substance, is available to further scientific research on Austrian garden art and garden culture and affords first informations to protect and preserve this important cultural heritage.The second volume of the inventarisation of the historic gardens and parks in Austria presen ...",

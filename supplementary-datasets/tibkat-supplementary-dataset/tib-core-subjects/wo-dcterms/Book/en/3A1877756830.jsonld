            "abstract": "People have been finding inspiration in nature in solving their problems, from the very beginning of their existence. In the most general sense, biomimicry, defined as \"inspire from the nature,\" has brought together the engineers and designers nowadays. This collaboration creates innovative and creative outcomes that encourage people with their interdisciplinary relationships. Accordingly, the aim of this book is to bring together different works or developments on biomimetics in interdisciplinary relationship between different areas, especially biomimicry, engineering, and design. The twenty-first century has conceived many new and amazing designs. The book in your hands will surely be an important guide to take a quick look at the future possibilities",

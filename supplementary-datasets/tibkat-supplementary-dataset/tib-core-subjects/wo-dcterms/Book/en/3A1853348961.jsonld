Similarly, particular attention has been given to homogenization techniques for the evaluation of the mechanical properties of new materials and multi-phase composites. Innovative numerical approaches for the mechanical analysis, highlighting their accuracy, reliability, and stability features, have been also welcomed. Significant space has been also given to advanced and sustainable technologies. From the aforementioned topics, it is evident that this Special Issue represents the ideal forum for disseminating excellent research findings, as well as sharing innovative ideas in this significant field.Throughout the several months of activity, this Special Issue has been able to attract much interesting research. Its success is proven by the sixteen papers collected and published",

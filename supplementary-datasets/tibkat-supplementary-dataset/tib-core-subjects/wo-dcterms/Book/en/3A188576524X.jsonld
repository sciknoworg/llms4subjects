            "abstract": "Many recent developments in mixed reality applications are exploited for research on improving training in the construction industry. While immersive technologies offer indisputable advantages over classic paper- or multi-media-based training material, access to this kind of technology is still very limited in the academic world and even less widespread in industry. In this paper, the authors follow the current trend of creating low-threshold micro-learning nuggets, which are easily consumable on mobile devices but can be accessed in every web browser. This is essential to reach the construction trade workforces, which for the most part will own a smart or mobile device, but neither specialized equipment, nor will there be time or patience for a lengthy setup phase before learning content consumption. The learning content aims to give construction workers a clear vision of what some of the fundamental components of a sustainable construction site should look like and what role they play in achieving the said vision. The learning content revolves around the initial idea of DGNB certification (German: German Sustainable Building Council), waste management, certification of construction wood, handling of harmful substances and chemicals and some general health and safety regulations that impact the emission of dust, noise and vibration. The paper describes the general approach of the planning, orchestration of learning material, development of the learning nugget, and deployment, as well as a study for acceptance and user experience",

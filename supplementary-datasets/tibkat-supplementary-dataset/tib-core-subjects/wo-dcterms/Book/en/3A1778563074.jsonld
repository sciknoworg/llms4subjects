            "title": "Recent Developments on Power Inverters",
            "abstract": "This book develops some methods and structures to improve the power inverters for different applications in a single-phase or three-phase output in recent years. The reduction of the switching devices and multilevel inverters as changing structure for the power inverters and PDM and PWM methods as changing control methods for the power inverter are studied in this book. Moreover, power inverters are developed to supply open-ended loads. Furthermore, the basic and advanced aspects of the electric drives that are control based are taught for induction motor (IM) based on power inverters suitable for both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The main objective of this book is to provide the necessary background to improve and implement the high-performance inverters. Once the material in this book has been mastered, the reader will be able to apply these improvements in the power inverters to his or her problems for high-performance power inverters",

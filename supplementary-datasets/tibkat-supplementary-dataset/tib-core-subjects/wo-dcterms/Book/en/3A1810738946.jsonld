            "abstract": "Perovskite is a well-known structure with the chemical formula ABX3 (where A and B are cations coordinated with 12 and 6 anions, respectively, and X is an anion). When a halogen anion is used, the monovalent A and divalent B cations can be stabilized with respect to a tolerance factor ranging from ~0.8 to 1. Since the first report on ~10% efficiency and long-term stability of solid-state perovskite solar cells in 2012 and two subsequent seed reports on perovskite-sensitized solar cells in 2009 and 2011, perovskite solar cells have received increasing attention. The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells was certified to be more than 23% in 2018, surpassing thin-film solar cell technologies. Methylammonium or formamidinium organic ion-based lead iodide perovskite has been used for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. The first report on solid-state perovskite solar cells triggered perovskite photovoltaics, leading to more than 10,000 publications as of October 2018. In addition, halide perovskite has shown excellent performance when applied to light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, and resistive memory. This indicates that halide perovskite is multifunctional.This book details the recent progress in halide perovskite photovoltaics, LEDs, and resistive memory, as well as the fundamentals of organic-inorganic halide perovskite. The book also explains the electro-optical and ferroelectric properties of perovskite, scalable and tandem perovskite solar cells, and perovskite LEDs and resistive memory. It is a great textbook and self-help study guide for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level students of materials science and technology, chemistry, chemical engineering, and nanotechnology; for researchers in photovoltaics, LEDs, resistive memory, and perovskite-related opto-electronics; and for general readers who wish to gain knowledge about halide perovskite",

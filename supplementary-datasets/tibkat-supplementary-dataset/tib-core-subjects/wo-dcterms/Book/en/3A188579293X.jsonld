            "abstract": "This cutting-edge research companion addresses our current understanding of literary journalism\u2019s global scope and evolution, offering an immersive study of how different nations have experimented with and perfected the narrative journalistic form/genre over time. The Routledge Companion to World Literary Journalism demonstrates the genre\u2019s rich genealogy and global impact through a comprehensive study of its many traditions, including the cr\u00f3nica, the ocherk, reportage, the New Journalism, the New New Journalism,  Jornalismo liter\u00e1rio, periodismo narrativo bao gao wen xue, creative nonfiction, Literarischer JournalismusAs-SaHafa al Adabiyya, and literary nonfiction. Contributions from a diverse range of established and emerging scholars explore key issues such as the current role of literary journalism in countries radically affected by the print media crisis and the potential future of literary journalism, both as a centerpiece to print media writ large and as an academic discipline universally recognized around the world. The book also discusses literary journalism's responses to war, immigration, and censorship; its many female and Indigenous authors; and its digital footprints on the internet. This extensive and authoritative collection is a vital resource for academics and researchers in literary journalism studies, as well as in journalism studies and literature in general.

                "This book highlights the latest advances, innovations, and applications in the field of resilience and adaptation of buildings and cities to climate change, as presented by international researchers at the VI International Conference on Recovery, Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Buildings (CIRMARE 2023), held in Covilh\u00e3, Portugal, on December 5\u20137, 2023. It covers a diverse range of topics such as accessibility of buildings and urban spaces, industrialization of rehabilitation processes, interventions in cultural heritage, building quality assessment, maintenance and requalification of built spaces, BIM and the digitization of construction, urban planning, circular economy in the construction sector, urban infrastructure rehabilitation, near zero energy buildings, urban resilience and climate change, recovery of degraded urban areas, service life, and pathologies in buildings. The contributions, which were selected by means of a rigorous international peer-review process, present a wealth of exciting ideas that will open novel research directions and foster multidisciplinary collaboration among different specialists.",

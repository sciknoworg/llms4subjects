            "abstract": "While many large and small communities experienced the rollercoaster real estate bubble of the past decade, the explosive boom and then precipitous bust in Teton County, Idaho was unprecedented. With a population of approximately 10,000 residents, today there are almost as many vacant platted lots as there are people. This oversupply did not develop overnight, but evolved over time as a result of years of policies and decisions by multiple political administrations of County Commissioners. These policies and decisions included allowing landowners to choose their own zoning, the adoption of a weak comprehensive plan, and the passage of a Planned Unit Development ordinance which granted up to 1,900 percent housing density bonuses. Just as this supply of real estate inventory built up over time, it took years for land speculators and the general public to realize that the market had become flooded and respond accordingly. In recent years, newer political administrations in Teton County have implemented policy changes, code amendments, and direct actions in an attempt to buffer the impacts of this crash as well as plan for a more stable future... Some of these polices have been effective, others have not, while some outcomes remain to be seen. Teton County has already vacated four \u201cpaper plats\u201d totaling 79 lots on 313 acres and more may soon be coming. A handful of developers have attempted to use the county\u2019s incentivized replatting ordinance to scale back their derailed projects, lower infrastructure costs, and reduce the environmental impacts of their developments, but none have yet been approved by Teton County. This is due to the fact that these replat proposals have largely been attempts at \u201cbackdoor\u201d extension requests whereby the developer tries to obtain the largest extension of time possible for completion of development infrastructure in exchange for minor reductions in the scale of the project. Teton County has taken more initiative to deal head-on with its glut of real estate inventory than possibly any other rural community in the West. One of the toughest lessons learned through this effort has been that it is much harder to undo bad decisions than to make good decisions to begin with. In the case of land use, once development entitlements are approved and a plat is recorded, it is difficult and in some cases impossible to successfully untie the entitlement knot. One clear conclusion of this real estate melt down is that if a speculati ...",

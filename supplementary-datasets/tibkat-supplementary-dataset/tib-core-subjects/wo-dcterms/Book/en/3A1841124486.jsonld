            "abstract": "This paper has outlined an ambitious agenda for the WBG to support PPR enhancement at country, regional, and global levels as part of a broader approach to strengthen health systems. It is an agenda that not only seeks to deliver on the Bank's IDA commitments related to disease outbreaks and crisis response but also to respond to demands from all our shareholders, clients, and other stakeholders for the Bank to play a key role in strengthening PPR capacities at country and regional levels through a wider health system strengthening agenda. Policy commitments from IDA's Human capital special themes support the building of resilient health systems that can provide core essential health services and have the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks and other health emergencies an approach that will ensure sustainability, efficiency, and effectiveness. The paper has highlighted that PPR is an inherently multisectoral agenda. Further, the paper has argued that there are large financing gaps to fill, particularly in LICs and MICs. Looking forward, the WBG will support strengthening of PPR through actions in three interconnected domains: 1) financing; 2) global engagements and partnerships; and 3) analytics, evidence, and dialogue",

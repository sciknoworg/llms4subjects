                "In recent years, micro- and nanotechnologies became key technologies, having a significant effect on the development of new products and production technologies, as well as on novel medical diagnosis and treatment methods. Moreover, due to their enormous potential for new applications, micro- and nanotechnologies, in future, will increasingly affect our every days life, with an impact, comparable to that of the industrial revolution in the 19th century, or the developments in microelectronics in the 20th century. Although, micro- and nanotechnologies, in general, are regarded as two independent disciplines, there is obviously an intense interaction between these two fascinating technologies. The term \"MicroNano Integration\", in this context, addresses the enormous potential of synergy effects, provided by the combination and mutual integration of micro- and nanotechnological elements. In order to discuss the integration aspects of micro- and nanotechnologies, the \"International Forum on MicroNano Integration\", a conference, held in Potsdam, Germany on December 3 - 4, 2003 brought together researchers from both communities - from industries as well as from scientific institutions. The contributions to this book reflect the discussions during the conference. .",

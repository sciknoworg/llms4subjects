            "abstract": "Some 15 years ago, all teachers in Norway became writing teachers\u2014at least according to the new curriculum\u2014overnight. Following a \u201cPISA-shock\u201d in the early 2000s, Norwegian legislators decided to reform the national curriculum by introducing five cross-curricular \u201ckey competencies\u201d to be taught by all teachers: writing, reading, mathematics, ICT and oracy. To accommodate teachers other than language arts teachers, the curriculum was amended to include subject-specific writing characteristics. This purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, an overview description of writing instruction in Norwegian schools using official documents as the main source is provided. Second, aided by a newly developed writing competency model, a fine-grained review of the language arts subject syllabi, the chapter presents an analysis of how writing and writing development is framed in the language arts subject syllabi",

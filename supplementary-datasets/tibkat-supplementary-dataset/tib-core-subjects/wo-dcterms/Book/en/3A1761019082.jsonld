            "abstract": "Connie Kelly Tang and Lei Zhang have provided a holistic coverage of the entire surface transportation project and program development process from the beginning of planning though environmental approval, design, right-of way acquisition, construction to operations and maintenance.-- Neil Pedersen, Executive Director, Transportation Research Board, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Washington, DC Transportation program and project development is complex. The process spans over planning, programming, environment, design, right of way, construction, operations, and maintenance. Professionals from civil engineering, planning, social and environmental sciences, business and project management, and data science, work together in a relay team to transform an idea into a highway, a transit hub, an airport or a water facility. It is challenging for any one person to master all the knowledge and skills needed to perform every relevant task. However, it is critical for all involved to understand how this relay works and how the societal, environmental, governmental, and regulatory contexts influence the process and the technical solution. Professionals who understand the process and see the big picture are those who rise to the top as leaders. Transportation Project and Program Development provides holistic coverage on the technical subject matter, processes and procedures, and policy and guidance associated with transportation project and program development, which can help professionals become program leaders. For each phase of the process, key products delivered, processes used, governing principles, foundations of applicable science and engineering, technologies deployed, and knowledge required are discussed. While all coverages reflect the practices of the United States, the logic, principles, science, and engineering are applicable to all countries of the world. The book can also serve as an introductory textbook for undergraduate students and as a textbook or reference for a graduate-level course in civil engineering, transportation engineering, planning, and project management",

                "\"Indigenous Management Practices in Africa: A Guide for Educators and Practitioners is a timely response to the recent call for management philosophies and theories that reflect the peculiarities of the African continent. Western management models in Africa may not have yielded the results required to trigger economic growth and development, yet Africa is fast becoming the investment destination of firms operating outside the continent. This book unravels the indigenous management practices that shape the way that organisations operate in Africa. It also addresses the differences between indigenous African and western management practices, at the same time considering the implications for African business management. Insights from the book offer a framework for developing African management curricula for business schools, both within and outside the continent. Practitioners aiming to expand their operations on the continent may also find valuable insights in this book \u2013 ones that may support and develop future management decisions.\"--"

Nations that desire a wealthy society in the future should match their past experience with their present scientific capabilities. Space industry provides the opportunity to improve many sectors such as defence, engineering, medicine, communication, meteorology and agriculture. With the advance in technology, other areas such as thermal regulation, navigation, earth observation through optics, mechanics, electronics, materials science, and research areas such as astrophysics exploration are also enhanced by the space industry. Thus, the need to address all aspects of this industry, including economic, legal, and scientific aspects, has emerged. This book of Symposium Proceedings contains the written versions of most of the contributions presented during the first Space Economics, Space Law and Space Sciences Symposium on 29- 30 May 2021 at Istanbul University. The symposium was held by Istanbul University Faculty of Economics together with co-organizers, the Faculty of Law and the Observatory Application and Research Center. The symposium brought together experts from different disciplines to share information and to develop a common purpose toward 1) understanding the limitations, opportunities and features of the space industry, 2) analyzing the differences between local and global legislative regulations, and 3) establishing a national strategy of action for research to build the capability of the Turkish space industry. Twenty-four distinguished researchers from six different universities and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkiye gathered for this symposium, and twenty-one well qualified papers were presented in four sessions. The Head of the Turkish Space Agency and the Head of Turkish Aerospace Industries were invited as keynote speakers. The President of Defense Industries and the Deputy Minister of Industry and Technology participated as opening speakers. Their presentations provided a good balance between the needs and conditions of the industry and the trends and developments in economic, legal and scientific aspects of space. The main goal of the symposium was to promote research and activities in space studies and share information on space laws and space economics for Turkish Space Policy. The contents of the papers in the symposium were delivered using a multi-disciplinary approach to space studies and an enlightening approach to the Turkish Space Program. In terms of disciplines, contributions included the international space race, the importance of the TURKSAT-6A satellite project, asteroid mining, effects of a solar flare on satellites, economic growth, mission state, management, public finance, international relations, technology policy, space race, international agreements on space law, satellite constellation, the East Anatolian Observatory Project, and space tourism. We would like to thank all participants for their contributions to the Symposium program. However, the book contains only the papers that were submitted by the authors",

            "abstract": "\"Noble's work has always engaged, in its own way, with the Western Canadian tradition of poetry as intellectual experiment grounded on local experience.... Death Drive marks a counter-turn in the work of one of Southern Alberta's most distinctive writers.\" - Chris Jennings, Department of English, University of Ottawa In this collection of poetry, Charles Noble further reins in an already tight form - haiku - only to let loose a \"logopoeic\" poetry. He presents poems of extraordinary rigour and riddles of wit that are solved by \"lifetime\" insights - a dialectical poetry that still observes a phenomenological toehold but transcends the limits of locality in recognizing the curled-up-but-everywhere world of media and markets - \u00e0 la Fredric Jameson. And yet, these \"haikus\" go straight - to \"the shock of the na\u00efve.\" They turn to a middle ground, in Aristotle's sense of difficult target. They point to human acts, human reactions, and enact, themselves, a meta-linguistic wrestling, at one with the quarreling couple in the bar hanging on each other's words and insistent with \"what do you mean by [a simple word]?\" But they are also implicated in what he calls the death drive (not death wish), which arcs freely over a human life span - think architecture - and which, more radically, in the \"pleated/ crossword,\" \"make[s]/ good// a/ bit/ of/ bad/ infinity,\" no expenses, save for that toehold, earth, as he would have it",

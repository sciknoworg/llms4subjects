            "title": "Shaping Sustainable Consumption and Production Agenda in TurkeyA Study on Economic Instruments to Support SDG 12",
            "abstract": "In September 2015, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development was adopted by member states of the United Nations (UN) at an historic UN summit. Sustainable consumption and production (SCP), as specifically reflected by SD goal (SDG) 12, is among the most important SDGs in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. The Government of Turkey (GoT) is dedicated to taking action for the successful implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, it welcomes the universal and integrated nature of SDGs. The World Bank (WB) and other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) are committed to helping national governments integrate their development agendas with the SDGs and supporting the design and use of economic instruments to ensure their effective implementation. The purpose of this report is to review Turkey's on-going efforts as well as international experience in implementing economic instruments to support SCP as specified in SDG 12, analyze the gaps, and discuss areas where Turkey may better adopt economic instruments and other incentive policies for promoting SCP in the new national development plan (NDP). The study contains six chapters. Chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two provides an overview of Turkey's involvement in the global sustainable development agenda, a summary of SDG12 and key themes of SCP. Chapter three introduces the conceptual framework on green financing, and summarizes international experience on the use of economic instruments with a focus on SCP. Chapter four explores the Turkish context of economic instruments to support SCP and reviews existing economic policies and instruments. Areas for improvement and recommendations are presented in chapter five. Chapter six provides concluding remarks",

The authors describe existing schools and concept schools\u2014those that are ideas but not in operation. The first section includes the editors\u2019 own journeys Pillar One includes schools that emphasize the open flow of ideas and choices, regardless of their popularity. Pillar 2 maintains that it is impossible to have a high quality education that ignores equity. Chapters explore how many diverse \u2018marginalized\u2019 communities experience education and some innovations that hold great promise for inclusion. Pillar 3 provides examples of schools where active engagement, consensus and compromise support the \u2018common good.\u2019 Pillar 4 investigates schools which organize students, parents, social institutions and the larger community collaboratively to achieve its goals and to solve theirs and society\u2019s most urgent challenges",

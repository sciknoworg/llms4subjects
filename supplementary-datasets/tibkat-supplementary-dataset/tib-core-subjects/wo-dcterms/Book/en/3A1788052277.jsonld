            "abstract": "\"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are mechanisms for monitoring and controlling processes using computer-based algorithms. In the construction industry, CPSs help in increasing the viability of construction projects by reducing costs, time and management effort. This book aims to develop the fundamental concepts of construction project management associated with the CPSs and their applications within the modern construction industry in alignment with the scope of the fourth Industrial Revolution IR4.0. The book has been structured in a systematic way for easy understanding by construction industry researchers and academic faculty. The first part of the book helps readers to develop a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts of construction project management and CPSs. Followed by the second part about the CPSs implementation framework and understanding the operational concepts associated with the notion of IoT and Digital Twins within the construction industry. The third part of the book describes modelling/simulation techniques to develop the customised CPSs for construction project management. The concluding part provides an in-depth review of applications of CPSs, associated threats and security\"",

                "This open access book introduces a groundbreaking concept - civil society elites - and serves as an essential resource for scholars, researchers and students interested in the complexities of power and influence within contemporary civil societies. Through a series of unique empirical studies, the authors offer a comprehensive examination of the individuals occupying the upper echelons of influential civil society organisations and movements. By delving into the factors that propel individuals into key positions and examining the connections between civil society leaders within and across sectors, the book offers insight into the mechanisms that shape access to powerful positions in civil societies. As a reflection of current debates on elites and populism, the book furthermore explores the expression and conceptualisation of counter-elite positions and criticism of civil society elites. With its original approach, the book serves as a catalyst for further research into inequalities, power structures and elites within civil societies. H\u00e5kan Johansson is Professor of Social Work at Lund University, Sweden. He has a long-standing interest into studies of civil society, which includes street protests, social movements, lobbying and advocacy as well as studies into Europeanisation of civil societies and civil society elites. Anna Meeuwisse is Professor of Social Work at Lund University, Sweden. Her main research interests are social movements and the role of civil society in welfare states. In recent years, she has conducted research on the Europeanisation of Swedish civil society, elitisation processes, and on transnational conservative movements that oppose sexual and reproductive rights."

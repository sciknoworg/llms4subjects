            "abstract": "The point of this chapter is to disrupt the \u2018truth\u2019 that food marketing contributes to childhood obesity by critically examining how certainty about this relationship is (re)produced through expert knowledge and the unquestioning acceptance of the \u2018junk food marketing = childhood obesity\u2019 discourse. My aim here is to illuminate how dominant obesity discourses work to produce \u2018regimes of truth\u2019 about the relationship between food marketing and childhood obesity; how expertise, power, knowledge, and discourses congeal and cohere to (re)produce the taken-for-granted assumption that junk food marketing = childhood obesity. In a similar vein to Gard and Wright\u2019s critique of \u2018certain\u2019 obesity discourses in physical education, my central concern is how scholars \u2013 particularly in the field of public health \u2013 contribute to the dismantlement of uncertainty (with respect to knowledge about the relationship between \u2018junk\u2019 food advertising and fatness) and the concomitant construction of certainty \u201cwhere none seems justified\u201d",

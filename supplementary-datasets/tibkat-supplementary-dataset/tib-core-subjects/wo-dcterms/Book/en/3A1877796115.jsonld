            "abstract": "Palestinian writing imagines the nation not as a nation-in-waiting but as a living, changing structure that joins people, place, and time into distinct formations. Novel Palestine examines these imaginative structures so that we might move beyond the idea of an incomplete or fragmented reality and speak frankly about the nation that exists and the freedom it seeks. Engaging the writings of Ibrahim Nasrallah, Nora E. H. Parr traces a vocabulary through which Palestine can be discussed as a changing and flexible national network linking people across and within space, time, and community. Through an exploration of the Palestinian literary scene subsequent to its canonical writers, Parr makes the life and work of Nasrallah available to an English-language audience for the first time, offering an intervention in geography while bringing literary theory into conversation with politics and history. \u201cA welcome demonstration of the power of writing to redefine the political domain.\u201d \u2014 LYNDSEY STONEBRIDGE, author of We Are Free to Change the World: Hannah Arendt\u2019s Lessons in Love and Disobedience \u201cAn opportunity to reconsider and reinterpret the dominant discourses and motifs of Palestinian culture.\u201d \u2014 JOSEPH R.

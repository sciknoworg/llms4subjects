            "abstract": "Current social and technological processes are overtaking many visions developed in classic 20th century science fiction at breathtaking speed; other elements of the genre remain 'alien' even today. In order to explore this tension, this volume looks at places that focus on this ambivalence: the heroes, thought and action patterns of science fiction. According to this guiding thesis of the volume, elements can be found in science fictional thinking that are relevant for the analysis and critique of current pedagogical conditions. The authors use science fiction to put a 'different' perspective on familiar educational discussions about schools, ageing and the concept of education, as well as their own disciplinary history, and thus to (re)think them",

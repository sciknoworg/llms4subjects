            "abstract": "\"In this significantly revised third edition, Designing Zero Carbon Buildings combines embodied and operational emissions into a structured approach for achieving zero emissions by a specific year with certainty. Simulation and quantitative methods are introduced in parallel with analogue scale models to demonstrate how things work in buildings. Where equations are provided, this is also explained with common analogue objects, pictures and narratives. A Zero Equation introduced in the book, is not only explained as an equation but also as an analogy with a jam jar and a spoon, making the book accessible for a range of audiences. Tasks for simple experiments, exercises, discussion questions and summaries of design principles are provided in closing lines of chapters. The book introduces new case studies, in addition to updated case study of the Birmingham Zero Carbon House, applying embodied and operational emissions to assess their status using the Zero Equation. The approach introduced brings about a sense of realism into what true zero emissions mean. Written for students, educators, architects, engineers, modellers, practising designers, sustainability consultants and others, it is a major positive step towards design thinking that makes achieving zero carbon emissions a reality\"--",

                "\u201cSituated in the era of the Anthropocene, this book volume recognizes the political urgency of re-envisioning science education with and for the community while dismantling the taken-for-granted deficit narratives of what science [education] is. Transcending disciplinary and geographical boundaries, the book calls us to reimagine science education in a more-than-human world, which places ecojustice, critical pedagogies, solidarity, and collectivity at the forefront.\u201d \u2014Lucy Avraamidou, Associate Professor and Rosalind Franklin Fellow, University of Groningen, The Netherlands \u201cThis inspiring collection showcases the kind of creative thinking-without-borders we would need to prepare our students to meet the challenges of the Anthropocene. It makes me wish I were back in grad school to begin my research career afresh with the help of the wonderful assortment of ideas, insights, and perspectives that this book so generously offers.\u201d \u2014Ajay Sharma, Associate Professor, University of Georgia, USA This open access edited volume invites transdisciplinary scholars to re-vision science education in the era of the Anthropocene. The collection assembles the works of educators from many walks of life and areas of practice together to help reorient science education toward the problems and peculiarities associated with the geologic times many call the Anthropocene. It has become evident that science education\u2014the way it is currently institutionalized in various forms of school science, government policy, classroom practice, educational research, and public/private research laboratories\u2014is ill-equipped and ill-conceived to deal with the expansive and urgent contexts of the Anthropocene. Paying homage to myopic knowledge systems, rigid state education directives, and academic-professional communities intent on reproducing the same practices, knowledges, and relationships that have endangered our shared world and shared presents/presence is misdirected. This volume brings together diverse scholars to reimagine the field in times of precarity. Maria F. G. Wallace is Assistant Professor at the University of Southern Mississippi, USA. Jesse Bazzul is Associate Professor of Science and Environmental Education at the University of Regina, Canada. Marc Higgins is Assistant Professor in the Department of Secondary Education at the University of Alberta, Canada, where he is affiliated with the Faculty of Education\u2019s Aboriginal Teacher Education Program (ATEP).

            "abstract": "After publishing the famous \u201cFluvial Processes in Geomorphology\u201d in the early 1960s, the work of Luna Leopold, Gordon Wolman, and John Miller became a key for opening the door to understanding rivers and streams. They first illustrated the problem to geomorphologists and geographers. Later, Chang, in his \u201cFluvial Processes in River Engineering\u201d, provided a basis for engineers, showing this group of professionals how to deal with rivers and how to understand them. Since then, more informative studies have been published. Many of the authors started to combine fluvial geomorphology knowledge and river engineering needs, such as \u201cTools in Fluvial Geomorphology\u201d by G. Mathias Kondolf and Herv\u00e9 Pi\u00e9gay, or focused more on river engineering tasks, such as \u201cStream Restoration in Dynamic Fluvial Systems: Scientific Approaches\u201d by Andrew Simon, Sean Bennett, and Janine Castro. Finally, Luna Leopold summarized river and stream morphologies in the beautiful \u201cA view of the river\u201d. It appears that we continue to explore this subject in the right direction. We better understand rivers and streams, and as engineers and fluvial geomorphologists, we can establish tools to help bring rivers alive. However, there is still a hunger for more scientific tools that we could use to further understand rivers and to support the development of healthy streams and rivers with high biodiversity in the present world, which has started to face water scarcity",

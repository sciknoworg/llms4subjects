            "abstract": "\"In this book we will discuss both the operating principles and performance limits of a wide range of device technologies, and the technological requirements of applications. We will identify close synergies where technology capabilities and application requirements are closely aligned, and opportunities for generic optical frequency combs where multiple solutions and applications exist simultaneously. The main topics to be covered will include:(i) Different sources and methods of optical frequency combs generation including mode-locked lasers, optical resonators, opto-electronics, and nonlinear fibres. (ii) Applications of optical frequency combs in different technologies including sensing, spectroscopy, metrology, distance ranging and optical communications. (iii) Blue-sky novel physical concepts and promising future research directions for the field. With this book we aim at showcasing top level advances by key players in a multifaceted research ecosystem, and at the same time at providing a valuable service to our research community, by offering a comprehensive review which, at the same time, highlights challenges to be solved and promising future directions. This book will be a valuable resource for academics and researchers working in optical frequency combs, and more broadly in photonics and laser physics. It will also be of interest to postgraduate and graduate students of photonics and laser physics\"--",

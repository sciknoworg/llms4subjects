                "LEGO Mindstorms and SPIKE Prime are great products with vast capabilities, but are often so complex that many people don\u2019t know how to use them. LEGO provides a walk-through of a few projects to build, which are cool, but after building these many people get stuck on \u201cnow what?\u201d This book answers that question by showing the underlying principles required to build their own ideas. This book is a hands-on tour of how machines work with LEGO\u2014there\u2019s nothing like building a machine with your own to hands to understand how it works. It includes aspects of software engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. As parts and associated engineering concepts are presented, they will be shown in their practical use with graphical step-by-step assembly instructions. The concepts conveyed are mostly learned through building examples, with text explanation to reinforce the ideas being learned. Every engineering concept has a building example to go with it, in a quick build of less than 15 assembly steps. At the end of each chapter there\u2019s a project to tie the concepts of the chapter together of a little more complexity, involving 15 to 30 steps. These assembly steps are drawn with a computer aided design program that looks like the diagrams that LEGO produces for its products, so you'll be familiar with the look of the assembly directions. You will: Layout a Word Blocks or Python computer program from scratch See how LEGO building elements are meant to be assembled Manipulate the power source of a rotating shaft from an electric motor Use gears to alter the speed and torque of a power train Change the motion from a rotating shaft to a desired action Basic mechanisms (turntable, differential, cam, ratchet, etc.) to Use sensors (motion, distance, light, color) to make interactive inventions Integrate mechanical, software, and electrical subsystems in a project."

            "abstract": "Feng Menglong (1574\u20131646) was recognized as the most knowledgeable connoisseur of popular literature of his time. He is known today for compiling three famous collections of vernacular short stories, each containing forty stories, collectively known as Sanyan.  Appropriation and Representation adapts concepts of ventriloquism and dialogism from Bakhtin and Holquist to explore Feng\u2019s methods of selecting source materials. Shuhui Yang develops a model of development in which Feng\u2019s approach to selecting and working with his source materials becomes clear.  More broadly, Appropriation and Representation locates Feng Menglong\u2019s Sanyan in the cultural milieu of the late Ming, including the archaist movement in literature, literati marginality and anxieties, the subversive use of folk works, and the meiren xiangcao tradition\u2014appropriating a female identity to express male frustration. Against this background, a rationale emerges for Feng\u2019s choice to elevate and promote the vernacular story while stepping back form an overt authorial role",

            "abstract": "The results presented in this volume highlight some of the most recent advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology studies, from both the physical and chemical point of view, with an eye also to possible engineering applications. These studies demonstrate directly how effective, and at the same time stimulating is implementing the \u201ccross-fertilization\u201d procedure. Indeed, multidisciplinary research allows one to catch more easily the analogies inherent different areas of science, as well as to take advantage and optimize different methods and techniques, often borrowed from other research areas.In the present Special Issue, we included six published papers. The latter contributions, on the one hand, are developed at the theory level and, on the other hand, show experimental results on the realization and experimental characterization of nanostructured systems, suitable for yielding progress towards the realization of systems and devices, that can ultimately lead to industrial applications. The results show that recent scientific research advances in these areas may provide important steps in the direction of fostering innovation and technological development",

                "\u201cThis edited volume makes a key and original contribution towards a growing strand of research on EU good governance support in the neighbourhood and beyond, taking into account also the role of alternative governance exporters.\u201d \u2014Christine Hackenesch, Political Scientist and Senior Researcher, German Development Institute, Germany \u201cThis book, by a reputable group of EU scholars, provides a comprehensive and multi-national assessment of the EU\u2019s governance capacity and policy conditionalities both within the EU and beyond its borders. Strongly recommended.\u201d \u2014Ziya \u00d6ni\u015f, Professor of International Political Economy, Ko\u00e7 University, Turkey \u201cOnce hailed as a major strength of its external action, the European Union\u2019s promotion of good governance has recently suffered from severe difficulties. This volume provides a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment, and stands out by its broad geographical and issue coverage.\u201d \u2014Frank Schimmelfennig, Professor of European Politics, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland The European Union (EU) support for good governance reforms has been the cornerstone of its conditionality and funding policies and contributed its role as a transformative power. This book re-evaluates the EU\u2019s governance promotion capacity both within the EU and beyond its borders in light of the simultaneous decline in democracy in Europe in particular, and across the whole world in general. The book is divided into three parts. Part I focuses on the EU\u2019s good governance transfer to member and accession countries. Part II examines how and to what extent the EU\u2019s governance promotion strategies travel beyond its borders and focuses on neighbours, partners, and aid recipient countries especially in Africa. Part III turns to other regional and global actors and discusses the implications of illiberal contesters such as China and Russia on the future of EU\u2019s good governance promotion efforts. The findings of the book bring fresh insights for the scope and depth of the EU\u2019s governance transfer capacity.

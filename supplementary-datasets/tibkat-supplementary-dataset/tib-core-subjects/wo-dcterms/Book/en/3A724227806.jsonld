            "title": "Foreign Bank Acquisitions And Outreach : Evidence From Mexico",
            "abstract": "Between 1995 and 2005, foreign bank participation in Mexico rose from 2 percent of bank assets to 83 percent, as the top five largest banks were acquired by foreigners. This paper examines the link between foreign bank acquisitions and banking outreach. Using quarterly country, bank, and bank-municipality-level data, the authors find some contrasting patterns. As foreign bank participation rose due to foreign acquisitions, the number of municipalities with bank presence increased but the number of loan and deposit accounts fell for the country as a whole and for banks after they became foreign. The drop in the number of loans, however, was partially off-set by an increase in domestic bank loans. Further, the decline in loan and deposit accounts was more pronounced in more rural and poorer areas. Finally, only very rich and urban areas experienced an increase in branches after foreign acquisition",

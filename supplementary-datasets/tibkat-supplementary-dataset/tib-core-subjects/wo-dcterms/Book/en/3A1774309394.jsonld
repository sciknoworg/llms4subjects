            "abstract": "Early grade reading assessment (EGRA) is a simple instrument that measures foundational reading skills in grades (years) 1 to 3. The results are used to identify progress towards achieving reading fluency and comprehension, which are essential skills for learning and completing primary education. This report summarizes the results of EGRA conducted in the Solomon Islands from September 11 to October 20, 2017. With funding from the global partnership for education (GPE), the World Bank and education technology for development (ET4d) carried out the assessment in collaboration with the Pacific Community and the Solomon Islands Ministry of Education and Human Resources Developments (MEHRD). The findings of this assessment are expected to assist policymakers with designing effective early grade reading intervention strategies to improve student's literacy outcomes. This activity is part of the Pacific early age and readiness program (PEARL), which was established to support Pacific Island countries improve policy and programming decisions around early grade literacy and school readiness. The analysis of Solomon Islands EGRA (SIEGRA) data included descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) to measure average levels in basic reading skills, an analysis of variance to determine statistical significance of gender and regional differences, and regression analysis to estimate the association of a given teacher, student, or classroom characteristic and reading fluency outcomes. The key findings, factors associated with reading performance, and recommendations are presented in the report",

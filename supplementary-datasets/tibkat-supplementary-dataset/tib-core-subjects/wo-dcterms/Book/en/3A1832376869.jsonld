            "abstract": "Since the 1990s, ultrasound (US) has played a major role in the assessment of thyroid nodules and their risk of malignancy. Over the last decade, the most eminent international societies have published US-based systems for the risk stratification of thyroid lesions, namely, Thyroid Imaging Reporting And Data Systems (TIRADSs). The introduction of TIRADSs into clinical practice has significantly increased the diagnostic power of US to a level approaching that of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). At present, we are probably approaching a new era in which US could be the primary tool to diagnose thyroid cancer. However, before using US in this new dominant role, we need further proof. This Special Issue, which includes reviews and original articles, aims to pave the way for the future in the field of thyroid US. Highly experienced thyroidologists focused on US are asked to contribute to achieve this goal",

            "abstract": "This book covers the description of both conventional methods and advanced methods. In conventional methods, visual tracking techniques such as stochastic, deterministic, generative, and discriminative are discussed. The conventional techniques are further explored for multi-stage and collaborative frameworks. In advanced methods, various categories of deep learning-based trackers and correlation filter-based trackers are analyzed. The book also: Discusses potential performance metrics used for comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of various visual tracking methods Elaborates on the salient features of deep learning trackers along with traditional trackers, wherein the handcrafted features are fused to reduce computational complexity Illustrates various categories of correlation filter-based trackers suitable for superior and efficient performance under tedious tracking scenarios Explores the future research directions for visual tracking by analyzing the real-time applications The book comprehensively discusses various deep learning-based tracking architectures along with conventional tracking methods. It covers in-depth analysis of various feature extraction techniques, evaluation metrics and benchmark available for performance evaluation of tracking frameworks. The text is primarily written for senior undergraduates, graduate students, and academic researchers in the fields of electrical engineering, electronics and communication engineering, computer engineering, and information technology",

            "abstract": "The book \"Economic Sustainability of Culture and Cultural Tourism\" focuses on the economic sustainability of cultural and cultural tourism projects, but it also takes into account other aspects. It consists of eleven articles, which address cultural heritage, culture, cultural/creative industries and (cultural) tourism. Analysis in the cultural heritage-related articles deals with specific topics such as crowdfunding, cost-benefit analysis in the evaluation of cultural heritage project funding, industrial heritage/brownfields, and social assessment methods for the economic analysis of cultural heritage. Cultural work is further analyzed, offering a comparative economic sustainability analysis in the UK as well as support mechanisms for cultural/creative industries in Canada. Creative industries in the peripheral areas of Italy and Greece are also zeroed in on in the context of their sustainability. Articles focusing on (cultural) tourism address the topics of dark tourism, tourists' willingness to pay for cultural experiences, and the relationship between COVID-19 vaccinations and the volatility of travel and leisure companies. Additionally, the role of culture and heritage in tourism resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic is explored with interesting results",

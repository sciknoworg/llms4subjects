            "abstract": "WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a wireless broadband access network named by industry group called the WiMAX forum formed in June 2001. It is Wireless MAN with IEEE 802.16 family standards. Loosely, WiMAX is a standardized wireless version of Ethernet that enables the last mile, intended primarily as an alternative to wire technologies (such as Cable Modems, DSL and T1/E1 links ) to provide broadband access to customer premises. Mission of the WiMAX forum is to promote and certify compatibility and interoperability of broadband wireless products. This book touches most of the above issues in form of 22 individuals\u2019 papers containing research work in WiMAX domain in particular. WiMAX has two important standards/usage models: a fixed usage model IEEE 802.16-2004 for Fixed Wireless Broadband Access (FWBA) and a portable usage model IEEE 802.16e-2005, which is mainly concentrated on Mobile Wireless Broadband Access (MWBA). Both are released as standards and amendments are available in form of drafts. Higher data rate transmissions (@ 100 Mbps) are achieved in IEEE 802.16-2004 WiMAX through LOS communications which incorporate a stationary transmitter and receiver but IEEE 802.16e supporting NLOS communication is much complicated and little less bit rate is achieved. 2-11 GHz licensed band is the range of frequencies with TDD and FDD supports. The book will provide a wide horizon to visualize the WiMAX technology and its developments leading towards 4G systems. It will provide a good platform to the researchers with clues to the innovative ideas in WiMAX domain. I wish all the best to the authors and readers of this book in their successful research of WiMAX technology",

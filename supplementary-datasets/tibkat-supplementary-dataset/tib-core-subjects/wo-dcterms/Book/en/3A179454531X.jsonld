            "abstract": "The field of cognitive aging has evolved from a focus on cataloging age-related declines of brain and mind in healthy older people to a focus on interventions aimed at limiting those declines. Intervention research has obtained convincing evidence of the cognitive benefits of aerobic exercise and working memory training. Recently interest has broadened to include interventions that consider the social and physical environment of the aged individual. Examples of this are investigations of training cognitive-motor integration, interventions to reduce loneliness, mindfulness training, and human factors-based approaches to cognitive deficits. Such approaches move beyond targeting specific abilities in isolation to consider more broadly the overall well-being of the healthy older person. In this Research Topic we call for both empirical and review papers that consider interventions aimed at reducing cognitive and brain aging but also approaches that consider older individuals (animal and human) in their physical and social environment",

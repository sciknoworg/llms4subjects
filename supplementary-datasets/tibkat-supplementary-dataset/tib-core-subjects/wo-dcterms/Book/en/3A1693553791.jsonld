            "abstract": "\"Smart, strategic inventory management delivers competitive advantage, yet Stock Turn trends show that little seems to change. Sustainable improvement through increasing control of systems and processes generates savings that can, in turn, be invested in growth initiatives. Inventory is not something that just concerns Planning, Production and Finance. By working to better understand and control their inventory related processes, everyone can drive improvements that will harness inventory's potential to become a source of sustainable competitive advantage. Unlike other guides to inventory management, this book is not only aimed at planners or inventory managers but details the impact, both direct and indirect, that all functions have on inventory. It is rich in practical tools that can be clearly implemented, including a detailed Purchasing Strategy and guide to Error Management. It is also rich in best practice cases that further show how to implement these methodologies in a real world context. This book is essential reading for any manager or executive looking to boost their organisation's competitive advantage, as well as students of inventory management, production and operations management\"--",

            "abstract": "The research in this volume is based on the link between the Fourth Industrial Revolution and work. On this level, there are several questions. What is the nature of work 4.0? What is the relationship between the technological revolution and employment? What are the labour rights in the era of new business models? Can innovation be implemented without overcoming the twentieth-century subordination and the new forms of freedom and work responsibility? Do digitalisation and new forms of business organization change working relationships and favour new forms of collaboration and conflict? Are training, quality and freedom at work more important than wages? How do company planning and design relate to technology and work? Does digitalisation push knowledge-based economy to determine new forms of work? What projects need to be implemented by the involved parties (starting with the workers) for these transformations to be a step forward in working conditions and industrial relations? These and many other questions are the basis of the essays collected in this volume, born from the collaboration between authors of different backgrounds and experience: academics, journalists, entrepreneurs, managers, operators, trade unionists and trade union representatives",

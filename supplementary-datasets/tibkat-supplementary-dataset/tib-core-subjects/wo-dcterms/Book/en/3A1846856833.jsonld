                "This open access book brings together leading international violence researchers to examine the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on experiences of, and responses to, domestic and family violence. Drawing on empirical work situated within an international context, this book presents evidence alongside country specific case studies to provide a global exploration of how women\u2019s insecurity increased during this global health crisis at the same as their access to support services reduced. In addition, the differential impacts of the pandemic in relation to the experiences of priority cohorts, including violence experienced by children and temporary migrant women is also explored. The key focus is on the nature, extent, and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic on service delivery, accessibility of support, and access to justice for women experiencing domestic and family violence.

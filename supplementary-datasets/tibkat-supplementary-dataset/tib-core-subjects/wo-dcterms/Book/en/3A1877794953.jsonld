            "abstract": "This open access book connects Jane Jacobs's celebrated urban analysis to her ideas on economics and social theory. While Jacobs is a legend in the field of urbanism and famous for challenging and profoundly influencing urban planning and design, her theoretical contributions \u2013 although central to her criticisms of and proposals for public policy \u2013 are frequently overlooked even by her most enthusiastic admirers. This book argues that Jacobs\u2019s insight that \u201ca city cannot be a work of art\u201d underlies both her ideas on planning and her understanding of economic development and social cooperation. It shows how the theory of the market process and Jacobs\u2019s theory of urban processes are useful complements \u2013 an example of what economists and urbanists can learn from each other. This Jacobs-cum-market-process perspective offers new theoretical, historical, and policy analyses of cities, more realistic and coherent than standard accounts by either economists or urbanists",

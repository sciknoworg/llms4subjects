            "abstract": "Expert systems represent a branch of artificial intelligence aiming to take the experience of human specialists and transfer it to a computer system. The knowledge is stored in the computer, which by an execution system (inference engine) is reasoning and derives specific conclusions for the problem. The purpose of expert systems is to help and support user\u2019s reasoning but not by replacing human judgement. In fact, expert systems offer to the inexperienced user a solution when human experts are not available. This book has 18 chapters and explains that the expert systems are products of artificial intelligence, branch of computer science that seeks to develop intelligent programs. What is remarkable for expert systems is the applicability area and solving of different issues in many fields of architecture, archeology, commerce, trade, education, medicine to engineering systems, production of goods and control/diagnosis problems in many industrial branches",

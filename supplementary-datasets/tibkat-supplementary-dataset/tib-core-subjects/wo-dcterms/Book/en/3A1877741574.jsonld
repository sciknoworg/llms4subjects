            "abstract": "The management of chronic diseases is one of the tasks of all members of the health team, and different models need to be applied in the practice of chronic care management. One of these models is home care services. There are two main sections in this book. In the first part of the section, the concept of caregiving and care at home is explained. In the second part, the responsibilities of caregivers at home and the responsibilities of caregivers of people who have health problems that occur during different periods of life are discussed. In the second section, the problems of caregivers are also included. I would like to think that what is quoted in this book, which contains examples from different cultures of the world for home care approaches, will contribute to the development of home care services. This book is presented to all health professionals working in the field of health services as well as health politics professionals and students trained in these areas",

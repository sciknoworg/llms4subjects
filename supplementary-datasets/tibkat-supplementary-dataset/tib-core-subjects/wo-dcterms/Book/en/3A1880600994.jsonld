                "This volume offers a wealth of results written by experts from interdisciplinary fields, contributing on a diversity of topics targeting marine and maritime environmental sustainability in coastal and ocean-related areas. The reader will benefit from the diversity and breadth of topical coverage as well as concepts conveyed from a variety researchers. The book serves as an open knowledge platform combining naval architecture and marine engineering, ecology, biomedical informatics, public health, architecture engineering and building physics, nanotechnology as well as advanced technologies, innovation and related fields. The broad range of topics cover ecology, shipping, and health related issues. Specifically, the book presents chapters on the following: \u00b7 Shipping and ecology \u00b7 Topics of ocean wildlife and mega-fauna protection \u00b7 Big Data and sustainable applications for healthy and safe coastal cities \u00b7 Smart sustainable humanitarian assistance methods using large vessels \u00b7 Smart coastal city tourist activity, mobility management \u00b7 Urban climate condition mitigation \u00b7 Historical analysis of the case of disease outbreaks onboard ships \u00b7 Monitoring, simulating and decision making while developing housing at sea, such as in cruise-ships \u00b7 Conducting feasibility assessment for outbreak prevention following real-time, systematic disease detection on cruise ships \u00b7 Technological approaches for cruise ship disease propagation monitoring \u00b7 Scenario testing for sensors and actuators deployment to prevent and mitigate epidemics on cruise ships, as well as methods for improving biological safety on ships using nanotechnology The book is expected to engage researchers in multidisciplinary areas as well as students and interested readers. .",

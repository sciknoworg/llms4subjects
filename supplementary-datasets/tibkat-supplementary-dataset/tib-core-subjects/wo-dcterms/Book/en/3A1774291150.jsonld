            "title": "Country Gender Assessment for Ukraine 2016",
            "abstract": "Ukraine is currently classified as a lower-middle income country in 2014. The country experienced a sustained economic growth since the early 2000's, being associated with a fast reduction in poverty. However, the global financial and economic crisis hit the economy of Ukraine, generating one of the largest economic setbacks in Eastern Europe. To address these issues, this paper is focused at three dimensions of gender disparities in Ukraine: i) agency as ability to make decisions and take opportunities; ii) endowments, including education, health and demography; and iii) economic opportunities realized through access to the labour market and earnings. The paper is structured as follows. Chapter one is devoted to agency, shaping the process of using endowments by women in men, including legislation and institutional environment, political participation and decision-making, gender stereotypes in public attitudes, and subjective well-being. In Chapter two we examine the gender gaps in endowments across men and women, captured by enrolment to various education levels and preferred fields of study. This Chapter is also focused at the current demographic trends and their gender implications, as well as at the gender disparities in health, with a particular emphasis on communicable diseases and reproductive health. Chapter three examines the gender gaps in labour force participation and patterns of employment, including vulnerable and informal employment, gender-based segregation and labour migrations. The gap in earnings is analyzed in details by background characteristics of employment. The problem of poverty and vulnerability is outlined in gender dimension in this Chapter as well. Finally, the gender inequality in opportunities of career advancement is discussed in Chapter three, as well as disparities in financial inclusion and access to entrepreneurship in Ukraine. In Chapter four, we present some basic conclusions and policy recommendations of the revealed gender gaps",

            "abstract": "The area of wind energy is a rapidly evolving field and an intensive research and development has taken place in the last few years. Therefore, this book aims to provide an up-to-date comprehensive overview of the current status in the field to the research community. The research works presented in this book are divided into three main groups. The first group deals with the different types and design of the wind mills aiming for efficient, reliable and cost effective solutions. The second group deals with works tackling the use of different types of generators for wind energy. The third group is focusing on improvement in the area of control. Each chapter of the book offers detailed information on the related area of its research with the main objectives of the works carried out as well as providing a comprehensive list of references which should provide a rich platform of research to the field",

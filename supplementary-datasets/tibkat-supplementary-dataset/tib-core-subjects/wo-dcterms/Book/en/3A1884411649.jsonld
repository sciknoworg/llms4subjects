            "abstract": "\"This book presents a comprehensive view of the different theories of risk management in water, drawing on recent studies that serve to inform the way that practitioners consider their own risk practice. While it is commonplace to see risk described in technical and engineering terms when discussing water, this book argues that this is a flawed practice that results in poor decision-making, particularly where water intersects with social elements and the community. Challenging these traditionally held notions of risk, this book introduces the psychological and sociological underpinnings to water risk decisions. Using these, it argues for a broader view of risk-based thinking and proposes a number of evidence-based actions for policymakers to directly implement. Drawing on primary research conducted with water professionals across a variety of roles, the book highlights how the effect of psychological inputs, such as dread and reputation, can create barriers to implementing novel water solutions or projects. Through understanding the biases covered in this book, water practitioners can work to support processes that seek to encourage new and innovative methods in water management. This book will be of great interest to professionals working in water management, including those in government roles, planning departments and consultancies. It is also a great reference for students of both water resource management and risk studies more generally\"--",

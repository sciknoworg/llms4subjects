            "abstract": "The field of performing transcatheter interventions to treat vascular lesions has exploded over the past 20 years. Not only has the technology changed, especially in the arena of balloon/stent devices, but the techniques of approaching complex lesions has evolved over the past decade. Lesions that no one would have imagined treating back in the 1990's are now being done routinely in the catheterization suite. This book provides an update on the current techniques and devices used to treat a wide variety of lesions. Though, at first, the outward appearance of the topics appears to be varied, they are all related by the common thread of treating vascular lesions. We hope, by publishing this book, to accomplish two things: First, to offer insight from experts in their field to treat, both medically and procedurally, complex vascular lesions that we frequently encounter. Secondly, we hope to promote increased communication between areas of medicine that frequently don't communicate, between adult interventional cardiologists, pediatric interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists, and neurosurgeons. Much can be learned from our respective colleagues in these areas which can further our own world of interventions",

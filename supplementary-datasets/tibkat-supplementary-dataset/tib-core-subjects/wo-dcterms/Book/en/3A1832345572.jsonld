            "abstract": "We would like to provide the scientists a set of studies entitled \"Study of the Influence of Abiotic and Biotic Stress Factors on Horticultural Plants\". The reprint book contains 12 papers about the influence of the stress factors on the plant growth and soil parameters. Authors descripted the impact of the biotic and abiotic stress factors (i.e., high, and low temperature, salt, inorganic pollutants such as salts, heavy metals, phosphite, as well as irrigation) on the physiological, biochemical, and anatomical changes occurring in the plants at the cellular, tissue, organ, and whole plant level. The subject of these studies were different plant species, i.e., watermelon, lettuce, kale, potato, grapevine, hops, orchid, strawberry, and boxwood. The ideas of the papers can be divided into five topics: (1) achieving better quality of plant material for food production by changes made in the growth conditions, metabolic and genetic modifications; (2) increasing the plant resistance to environmental stresses by application of exogenous compounds of different chemical character; (3) reducing plant stress caused by anthropogenic activity applying nonmodified and genetically modified plants; (4) mitigating drought stress by irrigation; and 5) the positive effect of plant growth-promoting microorganisms on horticulture plants performance during drought stress",

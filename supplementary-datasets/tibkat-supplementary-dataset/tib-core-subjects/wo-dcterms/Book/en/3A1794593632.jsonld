            "abstract": "Barack Obama\u2019s political ascendancy has focused considerable global attention on the history of Kenya generally and the history of the Luo community particularly. From politicos populating the blogosphere and bookshelves in the U.S and Kenya, to tourists traipsing through Obama\u2019s ancestral home, a variety of groups have mobilized new readings of Kenya\u2019s past in service of their own ends.Through narratives placing Obama into a simplified, sweeping narrative of anticolonial barbarism and postcolonial \u201ctribal\u201d violence, the story of the United States president\u2019s nuanced relationship to Kenya has been lost amid stereotypical portrayals of Africa. At the same time, Kenyan state officials have aimed to weave Obama into the contested narrative of Kenyan nationhood.Matthew Carotenuto and Katherine Luongo argue that efforts to cast Obama as a \u201cson of the soil\u201d of the Lake Victoria basin invite insights into the politicized uses of Kenya\u2019s past. Ideal for classroom use and directed at a general readership interested in global affairs, Obama and Kenya offers an important counterpoint to the many popular but inaccurate texts about Kenya\u2019s history and Obama\u2019s place in it as well as focused, thematic analyses of contemporary debates about ethnic politics, \u201ctribal\u201d identities, postcolonial governance, and U.S. African relations",

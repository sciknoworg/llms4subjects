In the follow up to his book 'Transforming Technology into Profit', Andy takes you on a journey that explains how the organisation and culture within your business impact your company's ability to innovate. Using his 'Three Tiers of Successful Innovation', Andy reveals how to clearly identify what aspects of your business are holding back growth and how to use that information to transform your business into one that facilitates growth by revitalising the structure and culture of your business to focus employee behaviours on adding profitable new revenue streams. Part sequel and part companion volume to his previous book, Andy finally 'Cracks the Code' on how to unleash your business' ability to create and successfully commercialise new products. Written in the author's trademark conversational style, 'Cracking the Innovation Code', offers a refreshingly practical and real-world view, written by someone who has been there and done it, and enhanced by valuable case studies and contributions from numerous senior executives who have made life-long careers out of leading innovation, and with a passion for leading industrial manufacturing businesses\"--",

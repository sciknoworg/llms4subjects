                "This book examines non-traditional forms of security and expands the notion of security to include non-state actors and non-human actors. With a wide-ranging look into some of the \u2018new\u2019 security threats facing state and non-state actors today, this book is designed to specifically offer new angles on tackling these threats in the Caribbean region. It explores issues relating to viruses, war and conflict, migration, geopolitics, climate change and terrorism through multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives on global (in-)securities. Each chapter clearly elucidates the connectedness of these non-traditional threats, drawing on a remarkable number of the most recent reports and scholarly works. Most importantly, there is a lack of Caribbean studies in the security themes that are studied. This book is a much needed and timely addition to intellectual thought on Caribbean security in an increasingly fragmented world. It will be of great interest to students of international security studies, human security, global politics, and international relations. Georgina Chami is Lecturer, Institute of International Relations, University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and recipient of the Central America/Caribbean Fulbright Visiting Scholars Program in 2010 Jerome Teelucksingh is Senior Lecturer, in the Faculty of Humanities and Education at The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus, Trinidad.

            "abstract": "The adsorption of a series of amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(DL-lactide) (PEO-PL) diblock copolymers at the water/silica interface was investigated by ellipsometry and reflectometry. For all copolymers, a much higher saturation adsorption is found compared to that of the PEO homopolymers, indicating the importance of the PL block for the adsorption. The copolymers display a saturation adsorption that increases with increasing hydrophobic content of the polymer, and decreases with increasing hydrophilic content of the polymer. Despite this, however, the layer thickness observed is rather similar for all polymers, regardless of the length and composition of the copolymers. Moreover, the layer thicknesses were significantly higher than what would be expected for the unperturbered copolymer dimensions. The initial adsorption kinetics of the different copolymers are comparable. The initial adsorption rate increases cooperatively with concentration and is slower than that expected for diffusion-controlled adsorption. Moreover, the adsoFurthermore, pH titrations show that all polymers exhibit a critical desorption pH of 8-9, which is lower than the corresponding value of pH 10.5 observed for the PEO homopolymer. These results are discussed in terms of the adsorption mechanism and the adsorbed layer structure and formation.",

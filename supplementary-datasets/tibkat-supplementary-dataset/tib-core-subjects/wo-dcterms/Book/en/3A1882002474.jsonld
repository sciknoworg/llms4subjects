            "abstract": "\"An elegant presentation of interiors for introverts, placing the memorable work of London architect William Smalley alongside buildings around the world that have inspired his practice. Quiet Spaces places the work of architect William Smalley alongside spaces that have inspired him. Places of private contemplation - calm spaces to read a book or listen to music in, to walk through or simply be in - they are spaces that achieve a rare sense of repose and peace. From his own Bloomsbury Apartment and projects in the UK, France and New York, the book expands to include the work of other architects: a sixteenth-century villa by Palladio, houses in Mexico and Sri Lanka and the Secular Retreat in Devon by Swiss master architect Peter Zumthor. There are also places of making and displaying art: simplicity in Barbara Hepworth's garden and studio in Cornwall, and intimacy in Kettle's Yard gallery in Cambridge. Specially commissioned photography by Harry Crowder conveys the atmosphere of the spaces. A foreword by acclaimed potter and writer Edmund de Waal records the small, unspoken ways in which we relate to buildings and how they come to have meaning for us\"--Publisher's description",

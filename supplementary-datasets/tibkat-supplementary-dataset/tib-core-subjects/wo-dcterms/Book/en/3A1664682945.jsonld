                "\"In Six Impossible Things, John Gribbin offers an agnostic overview of some (six, exactly) of the main \"interpretations\" of quantum physics. To the great distress of many physicists, no one has been able to come up with a common sense explanation of what quantum physics is all about--this is why Albert Einstein eventually rejected quantum mechanics, even though is was one of it's pioneers! The equations in quantum mechanics work for endeavors like designing a laser, explaining the structure of DNA, or building a quantum computer. Generations of students have been told, in effect, to \"shut up and calculate\" -- don't ask what the equations mean, just crunch the numbers. More thoughtful physicists, seeking solace in other ways, have come up with a variety of more or less desperate remedies to \"explain\" what is going on in the quantum world. These remedies, the quanta of solace, are called \"interpretations,\" and each have their devout priests and followers. But none are perfect or universally accepted. And the new ones aren't necessarily better than the old ones. This book provides a brief but solid history of quantum mechanics, from its origins to present-day attempts to to grasp its metaphysical and philosophical implications\"--",
                "Preface: What's it all about, Alfie? the need for quantum solace -- Fit the first: The central mystery -- Fit the second: The tangled web -- Solace 1: The not so wonderful Copenhagen interpretation -- Solace 2: The not so impossible pilot wave interpretation -- Solace 3: The excess baggage many worlds interpretation -- Solace 4: The incoherent decoherence interpretation -- Solace 5: The ensemble non-interpretation -- Solace 6: The timeless transactional interpretation -- Conclusion: There ain't no sanity clause."

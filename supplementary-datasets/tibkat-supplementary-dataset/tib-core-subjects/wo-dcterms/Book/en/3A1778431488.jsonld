            "abstract": "In recent years, power electronics have been intensely contributing to the development and evolution of new structures for the processing of energy. They can be used in a wide range of applications ranging from power systems and electrical machines to electric vehicles and robot arm drives. In conjunction with the evolution of microprocessors and advanced control theories, power electronics are playing an increasingly essential role in our society. Thus, in order to cope with the obstacles lying ahead, this book presents a collection of original studies and modeling methods which were developed and published in the field of electrical energy conditioning and control by using circuits and electronic devices, with an emphasis on power applications and industrial control. Researchers have contributed 19 selected and peer-reviewed papers covering a wide range of topics by addressing a wide variety of themes, such as motor drives, AC\u2013DC and DC\u2013DC converters, multilevel converters, varistors, and electromagnetic compatibility, among others. The overall result is a book that represents a cohesive collection of inter-/multidisciplinary works regarding the industrial applications of power electronics",

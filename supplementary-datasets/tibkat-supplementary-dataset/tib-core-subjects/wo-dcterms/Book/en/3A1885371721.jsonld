                "This book is the first systematic effort to investigate the ramifications of the introduction of the Spitzenkandidaten process for the appointment of the President of the European Commission. It does so by examining the first two applications of the Spitzenkandidaten process from an historical, legal and political perspective. Although this process has spurred vibrant debate regarding its impact on EU elections and the EU political system, it has yet to be comprehensively analysed by scholars. Addressing this important gap, the book provides a conceptual framework for analysing the impact of the Spitzenkandidaten process, takes stock of its internal, inter-institutional and constitutional repercussions, and assesses its future prospects. Interdisciplinary in nature, the book touches on several important themes, including European elections, EU policy making, leadership, legitimacy, supranationalism and European integration. Published to coincide with the 2024 European Parliament election, it will appeal to scholars and students of the politics of European integration, public administration, governance, European politics and EU constitutional law. Matilde Ceron is a Researcher at the University of Salzburg, Austria. She was previously a Max Weber Fellow at the Robert Schuman Center for Advanced Studies, European University Institute, Italy. Thomas Christiansen is Professor of Political Science and European Integration at LUISS University, Italy. Dionyssis G. Dimitrakopoulos is Reader in European Politics and the holder of the Jean Monnet Chair in Parliamentary Democracy and European Integration at Birkbeck College, University of London, UK.",

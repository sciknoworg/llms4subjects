As such, assessing the risk of suicidal behavior and identifying protective factors and suicide prevention strategies can reduce suicide-related deaths. Self-harming behavior, which is frequently seen in adolescents and can be confused with suicide attempts, is an important public health problem. This book has been prepared to assist mental health professionals with evaluating individuals with suicide and self-harm behavior, identifying risk factors, and applying prevention strategies. It provides up-to-date knowledge and skills on suicide and self-harm behavior in adolescents. New Studies on Suicide and Self-Harm is designed to help those who work with patients with suicidal behavior and intentional self-harm behavior",

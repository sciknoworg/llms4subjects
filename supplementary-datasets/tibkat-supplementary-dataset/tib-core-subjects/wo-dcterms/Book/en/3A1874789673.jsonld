CAD-CAM stands for computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing. These systems are useful in all facets of contemporary design and architecture. The fundamentals of CAD-CAM systems are covered in detail throughout this book. This book aims to introduce fundamental aspects, complete with an adequate amount of illustrations and examples, without delving too deeply into the specifics of the subject matter. This book is valuable in the classroom for both teachers and students. Students and professionals need to have a working knowledge of CAD-CAM since it has many applications and continues to expand. Students at the undergraduate and graduate levels of engineering programs use this book as their primary textbook. It will be helpful for Managers, Consultants, and Professionals in the same measure\"--",

            "abstract": "The aim of this book is to give readers a broad review of topical worldwide advancements in theoretical and experimental facts, instrumentation and practical applications erudite by luminescent materials and their prospects in dealing with different types of luminescence like photoluminescence, electroluminescence, thermo-luminescence, triboluminescence, bioluminescence design and applications. The additional part of this book deals with the dynamics, rare-earth ions, photon down-/up-converting materials, luminescence dating, lifetime, bioluminescence microscopical perspectives and prospects towards the basic research or for more advanced applications. This book is divided into four main sections: luminescent materials and their associated phenomena; photo-physical properties and their emerging applications; thermoluminescence dating: from theory to applications, and bioluminescence perspectives and prospects. Individual chapters should serve the broad spectrum of common readers of diverse expertise, layman, students and researchers, who may in this book find easily elucidated fundamentals as well as progressive principles of specific subjects associated with these phenomena. This book was created by 14 contributions from experts in different fields of luminescence and technology from over 20 research institutes worldwide",

            "abstract": "With the collapse of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European bloc, the reunification of Germany was a major episode in the history of modern Europe \u2014 and one widely held to have been opposed by that country's centuries-old enemy, France. But while it has been previously believed that French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand played a negative role in events leading up to reunification, this book shows that Mitterrand's main concern was not the potential threat of an old nemesis but rather that a reunified Germany be firmly anchored in a unified Europe. Updated with a new introduction and other materials, the book blends primary research and interviews with key actors in France and Germany to take readers behind the scenes of world governments as a new Europe was formed. Tilo Schabert had unprecedented, exclusive access to French presidential archives and here focuses on French diplomacy not only to dispel the notion that Mitterrand was reluctant to accept reunification but also to show how successful he was in bringing it about. Tilo Schabert is Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Erlangen, Germany. He also taught at the Universities of Munich, Stanford, Bochum, Trier and Dresden, and was Research Fellow at Stanford, Harvard and the Australian National University, as well as Senior Heisenberg Research Fellow at the German Research Council. Schabert was Visiting Professor in Lisbon, Perpignan, Paris, Rennes, Salerno, Naples and Beijing.",

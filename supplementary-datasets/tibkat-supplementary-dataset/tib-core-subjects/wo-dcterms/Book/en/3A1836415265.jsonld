            "abstract": "Conceiving the Goddess is an exploration of goddess cults in South Asia that embodies research on South Asian goddesses in various disciplines. The theme running through all the contributions, with their multiple approaches and points of view, is the concept of appropriation, whereby one religious group adopts a religious belief or practice not formerly its own. What is the motivation behind this? Are such actions attempts to dominate, or to resist the domination of others, or to adapt to changing social circumstances \u2013 or perhaps simply to enrich the religious experience of a group\u2019s members? In examining these questions, Conceiving the Goddess considers a range of settings: a Jain goddess lurking in a Brahminical temple, the fraught relationship between the humble Cam\u0101r caste and the river goddess Ga\u1e45g\u0101, the mutual appropriation of disciple and goddess in the tantric exercises of Kashmiri \u015aaivism, and the alarming self-decapitation of the fierce goddess Chinnamast\u0101",

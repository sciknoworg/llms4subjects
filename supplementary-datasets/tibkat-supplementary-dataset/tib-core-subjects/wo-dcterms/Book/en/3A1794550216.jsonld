            "abstract": "An examination of the use of digital badges as a reward for both casual online music evaluators and professional musicians. Professional and amateur musicians alike use social media as a platform for showcasing and promoting their music. Social media evaluation practices\u2014rating, ranking, voting, \u201cliking,\u201d and \u201cfriending\u201d by ordinary users, peers, and critics\u2014have become essential promotional tools for musicians. In this report, H. Cecilia Suhr examines one recent development in online music evaluation: the use of digital badges to aid in assessment and evaluation. Digital badges have emerged in recent years as a potential credentialing method in informal learning environments. Suhr explores online music communities' use of digital badges as a reward for both casual music evaluators and musicians. Suhr examines the intersection of evaluation and gamification in Spotify's \u201cHit or Not\u201d game, in which players assess a song's hit potential and receive digital badges as rewards, and considers the implications of turning music evaluation into a game. She then explores in detail the development of peer and professional critics on Indaba Music, a cloud-based collaboration platform where musicians earn badges through participating in contests. Suhr considers the emerging challenges and shortcomings of contest-based virtual communities and the value of badges, as perceived by Indaba musicians. She investigates to what extent digital badges can effectively represent and credit musicians' accomplishments and merits; describes the challenges, benefits, and shortcomings of digital badges as an evaluation mechanism; and compares the use of digital badges in assessing creativity to their use in learning and credentialing institutions",

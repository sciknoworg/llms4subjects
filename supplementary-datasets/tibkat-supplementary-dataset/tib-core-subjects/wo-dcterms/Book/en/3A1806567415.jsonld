                "Introduction -- Thunderstorm, Lightning and Aircraft -- Prelightning Strikes and Aircraft Electrostatics -- Lightning-Aircraft Electrodynamics -- Lightning Physics, Modelling and Radiated Electromagnetic Fields (LEMP) -- Lightning Electromagnetics -- Protection of Power Transmission and Distribution Systems -- Protection of Aircraft and Airports -- Protection of Telecommunication and Computer Installations -- Protection of Commercial and Domestic Buildings -- Lightning, Climate Change and Engineering Concerns -- Lightning Risk Assessment.",
                "This book gives a contemporary and comprehensive overview of the physics of lightning and protection systems, based on nearly 40 years of research, teaching, and consultancy work in this area. The book begins with an overview of the climatology of lightning and electric storms, as well as giving insight into lightning discharge from the preliminary discharges or processes such as corona, stepped leader, and subsequent return strokes, including the important submicrosecond threats and continuous current. The subsequent chapters present measures of lightning threat analysis to aircraft and electric power systems, protection measures to be used in high-voltage to low-voltage computer and communication systems, as well as to commercial and domestic buildings. The book discusses challenges posed by the submicrosecond lighting current changes and climate change to present and future high-voltage apparatus and structures (including carbon composite aircraft and new buildings) exposed to lightning strikes. Including worked examples, illustrations, and detailed analysis, Lightening Engineering will be of interest to electrical engineers, as well as researchers and graduate students."

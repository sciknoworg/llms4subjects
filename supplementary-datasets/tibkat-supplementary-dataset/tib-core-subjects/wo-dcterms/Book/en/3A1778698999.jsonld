            "abstract": "China: Twenty Years of Reform outlines the experiences of China over the past two decades. It highlights the processes of reform, successes achieved, and problems faced during the economic transition.  \u201cChina, and its relations with the international community, have been transformed. China\u2019s economy has expanded five times, and its foreign trade by twelve. It has greatly increased consumption levels of what had been about half of the world\u2019s people in poverty.\u201d  - Ross Garnaut  \u201cTremendous progress has been made over the past twenty years, but much more needs to be done in setting up a more open, efficient and transparent trade system, in line with the requirements of the WTO.\u201d  - Ligang Song  \u201cRadical reform is neither in China\u2019s tradition, nor is it an easy task. Given the difficulties of the reform task and the structure of the political economy, it will probably take a few more years for China to accomplish SOE reform and reforms in other areas.\u201d  - Yiping Huang  \u201cThe most remarkable aspect of China\u2019s agricultural reform was it\u2019s \u201cspillover\u201d effect. Non-agricultural activities in rural China sprang up immediately after the reforms began\u2014the gross output value of TVEs grew at 24 per cent per annum from 1978 to 1995 and employment grew at 9 per cent per annum.\u201d  - Yongzheng Yang",

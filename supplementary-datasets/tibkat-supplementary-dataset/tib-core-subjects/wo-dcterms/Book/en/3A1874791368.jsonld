            "abstract": "\"Throughout the globe, STEM careers exist. However, in some countries, particular STEM careers have been male-dominated while in other countries no gender biases exist as it relates to STEM careers. One common trend which occurs throughout the world is that women who are working in these STEM related fields typically leave after about five years. Contrarily, it has also been uncovered that more women stay in these fields when we all work together. Empowering Women in STEM: Working Together to Inspire the Future provides the platform to share the stories of those who have been in STEM careers but have pivoted to other areas by utilizing the STEM skills they learned. It bridges the gap between those who are thinking about entering or leaving STEM careers, along with those who want to encourage others into STEM careers. This book showcases how everyone's journey is different, some may have unexpected twists and turns while others appear to conform to the \"normal\" rules outlined by society. By offering a front-row seat on a journey that takes many different paths, this book provides advice that can lead to a STEM career with or without having a STEM background\"--",

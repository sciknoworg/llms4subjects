                "This open access book explores the synergy between AI and education, highlighting its potential impact on pedagogical practices. It navigates the evolving landscape of AI-powered educational technologies and suggests practical ways to personalise instruction, nurture human-AI co-creativity, and transform the learning experience. Spanning from primary to higher education, this short and engaging volume proposes concrete examples of how educational stakeholders can be empowered in their AI literacy to foster creativity, inspire critical thinking, and promote problem-solving by embracing AI as a tool for expansive learning. Structured in three parts, the book starts developing the creative engagement perspective for learning and teaching to then present practical applications of AI in K-12 and higher education, covering different fields (teacher education, professional education, business education) as well as different types of AI supported tools (games, chatbots and AI assisted assessment). It also delves into the ethical considerations, policy implications, and the central role educators play in harnessing the power of an AI informed educational experience.

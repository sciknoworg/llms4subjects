                "This book provides readers with a deep understanding of the use of objective algorithms for integration of constitutive relations (CRs) for Hooke-like hypoelasticity based on the use of corotational stress rates. The purpose of objective algorithms is to perform the step-by-step integration of CRs using fairly large time steps that provide high accuracy of this integration in combination with the exact reproduction of superimposed rigid body motions. Since Hooke-like hypoelasticity is included as a component in CRs for elastic-inelastic materials (e.g., in CRs for elastic-plastic materials), the scope of these algorithms is not limited to hypoelastic materials, but extends to many other materials subjected to large deformations. The authors performed a comparative analysis of the performance of most currently available objective algorithms, provided some recommendations for improving the existing formulations of these algorithms, and presented new formulations of the so-called absolutely objective algorithms. The proposed book will be useful for beginner researchers in the development of economical methods for integrating elastic-inelastic CRs, as well as for experienced researchers, by providing a compact overview of existing objective algorithms and new formulations of these algorithms. The book will also be useful for developers of computer codes for implementing objective algorithms in FE systems. In addition, this book will also be useful for users of commercial FE codes, since often these codes are so-called black boxes and this book shows how to test accuracy of the algorithms of these codes for integrating elastic-inelastic CRs in modeling large rotations superimposed on the uniform deformation of any sample. ."

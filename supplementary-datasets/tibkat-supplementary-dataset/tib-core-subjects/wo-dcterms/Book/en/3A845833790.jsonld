            "abstract": "From the Foreword to the first issue: \u201cAmong the responsibilities of the International Monetary Fund, as set forth in the Articles of Agreement, is the obligation to \u2018act as a center for the collection and exchange of information on monetary and financial problems,\u2019 and thereby to facilitate \u2018the preparation of studies designed to assist members in developing policies which further the purposes of the Fund.\u2019 The publications of the Fund are one way in which this responsibility is discharged. \u201cThrough the publication of Staff Papers, the Fund is making available some of the work of members of its staff. The Fund believes that these papers will be found helpful by government officials, by professional economists, and by others concerned with monetary and financial problems. Much of what is now presented is quite provisional. On some international monetary problems, final and definitive views are scarcely to be expected in the near future, and several alternative, or even conflicting, approaches may profitably be explored. The views presented in these papers are not, therefore, to be interpreted as necessarily indicating the position of the Executive Board or of the officials of the Fund.\u201d The authors of the papers in this issue have received considerable assistance from their colleagues on the staff of the Fund. This general statement of indebtedness may be accepted in place of a detailed list of acknowledgments.

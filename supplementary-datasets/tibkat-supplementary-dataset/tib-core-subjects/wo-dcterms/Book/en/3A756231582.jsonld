                "\"This book focuses on all aspects of modern network analysis and design, aiming at presenting a thorough overview of the contemporary design approaches according to the viewpoint of Network Science and Complex Network analysis. This book takes a more radical perspective than previous books by establishing a top-bottom approach where elements of the higher layer are exploited for directly modifying the lowest physical topology, thus closing the design loop in an evolutionary fashion, similar to the one observed in natural processes. \"--",
                "\"Preface In this book, we start the exploration of evolutionary dynamics for complex networks with a working example that might look familiar to many people, at least partially. The speci c example intends to highlight the various aspects of everyday life and work where humans encounter, use, act on and obtain information from their interaction with complex communications networks, as well as numerous other emerging functions. Such example will drive the following steps of the exploration of this book into a research domain currently shaping and even expanding rapidly. Then we provide a more elaborated overview of the topic, related goals and features provided by this book. Finally, we provide potential alternative strategies for studying the material provided, depending on the whether the book is intended as a research reference, an undergraduate or graduate course reference manual, or simply a reference of broader interest. Working Example An executive of a multi-national company hires a taxi from Tokyo Financial Center towards the International airport to catch her return ight to the United States. The driver quickly consults the GPS device of the vehicle for the traffic street map, in order to identify the fastest route to the airport. The executive has requested for a speed lift, which will ensure she boards on time. The route duration estimation is a 40min route, safely enabling the executive to check her email through her mobile handheld device in the meantime, rather than worry about catching up her ight. Both the accuracy of the GPS application and the luxury of good international plan, allow her to focus on her job, while not wasting energy on logistics\"--"

            "abstract": "This is a compilation of 21 inauguration lectures from Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Sousa Henriques Seco (1856) to Jorge de Figueiredo Dias (2005), including Ant\u00f3nio de Arruda Ferrer Correia (1982), Lu\u00eds Cabral de Oliveira Moncada (1949) and Orlando Alves Pereira de Carvalho (1996), amongst many others. More than translating part of the University of Coimbra collection (namely the Faculty of Law), this book opens up the way to different horizons of law and of everything related to it. \u201cThe formality of the rite of the magisterial lecture is crisscrossed by so many lines \u2013 for anyone that wishes to see and perceive \u2013 that its study proves to be of enormous heuristic potential\u201d, writes Jos\u00e9 de Faria Costa, president of the Directive Council of the Faculty of Law and president of the University Press, in the foreword to this collection. \u201cIn addition to the pleasure of reading such powerful dense texts, we are also enchanted by the creativity that connects facts, constructs doctrines, lists and relates dates or suggests normative fissures that can be interpreted as discontinuities or ruptures\u201d, he adds. The work includes an essay by the history of law specialist, Rui de Figueiredo Marcos, entitled \u201cAs Ora\u00e7\u00f5es de Sapi\u00eancia na Universidade e na Faculdade de Direito de Coimbra\u201d (\u201cMagisterial lectures in Coimbra University and Law Faculty\u201d), which traces the development of these magisterial lectures at the University of Coimbra, since their enshrinement in the will of Infante D. Henrique dated 13th October 1460, to the present day. \u201cThe official opening of lessons and the magisterial lecture contain a tremendous symbolism for the institutional life of the University of Coimbra,\u201d he writes. \u201cGiven its enormous relevance, these were always moments that attracted great attention both from the university community and from the public at large\u201d.

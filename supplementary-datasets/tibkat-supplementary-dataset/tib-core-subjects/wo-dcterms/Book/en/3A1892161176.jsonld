                "Tokdo\u011fan combines cutting-edge perspectives on symbolic and emotional politics to analyse Neo-Ottomanism as a powerful political narrative under the AKP and Erdo\u011fan, which has transformed the national habitus of contemporary Turkey. Engaging, scholarly and enlightening, this book will be essential reading for scholars of political emotions, nationalism and Turkish politics and society. \u2014Dr. Jonathan G. Heaney, Queens University Belfast The author approaches the challenging period we are passing through with crucial questions. Contrary to theses declaring the end of politics (or history, or the subject), this study draws our attention to new forms and means of politics. \u2014Prof. Aksu Bora, Hacettepe University This open access book explores the politics of emotions under the ruling Justice and Development Party in Turkey and the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. It examines how emotional politics and, particularly, the use of a Neo-Ottomanist narrative created a new national mood and contributed to the durability of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rule. The author analyses the interactions between national narratives, symbolic politics and emotions. She argues that these interactions have formed the basis of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s popular support for more than 20 years. The book is a valuable resource for scholars of political science and sociology, as well as policymakers interested in the rise of authoritarianism in Turkey. Nagehan Tokdo\u011fan is a post-doctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development\u2019s Center for the History of Emotions. Her research focuses on the political sociology of emotions, nationalism, conservatism and authoritarianism in Turkey, as well as right-wing extremism, gender studies, and men and masculinities.",

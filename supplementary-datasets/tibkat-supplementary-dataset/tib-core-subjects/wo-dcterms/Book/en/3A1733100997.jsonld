The book complements other key topics in science and engineering courses well, such as the branch of thermodynamics which relates closely to the core design principles for heat exchanger networks (FThis book serves as an extensive practice manual for the understanding and practice of heat exchanger design fundamentals and principles. It also provides a useful resource to upper undergraduate students, who are required to complete final year design projects as part of graduation. The book complements other key topics in science and engineering courses well, such as the branch of thermodynamics which relates closely to the core design principles for heat exchanger networks (First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics). Provides balanced content with numerical and open-ended problems; Tailored to the needs of students and teachers; Concise yet rigorous treatment of concepts; Incorporates use of visuals to aid learning; Reinforces engineering concepts in real-life applications.",

            "abstract": "\"The goal of this textbook is to introduce the mathematical theory of incompressible fluid mechanics and its applications. It grew out of lectures for a new course on the subject given by SJAM to final year undergraduate as well as graduate students in Autumn 2010. The basic material for the lectures was drawn from lecture notes on 'Ideal Fluid Mechanics' devised by Frank and lecture notes on 'Viscous Fluid Mechanics' devised by Trevor. In October 2015, David Tranah from CUP suggested the lecture notes might be the seed for a textbook. After some delay, we all met in Autumn 2018, and the plans and structure for the book were laid. Once writing was in full swing, the book grew and developed substantially, and slightly transformed its character. However we hope the character of the book retains/includes the following essential features, it is: accessible; comprehensive; mathematical; practical; engaging and useful. Let us briefly expand on these. We attempt to take interested students on a full journey. This journey starts with the very basic notion of how to represent the flow, carries the reader through analytical solutions and/or pragmatic approximations to practical flow scenarios, problems and applications, and ends at/on the issue of the global existence of solutions to the fluid equations themselves. The practical and mathematical go hand in hand, and a central theme of the book is the dogged pursuit of the underlying mathematics and mathematical equations to obtain analytical solutions for the applied flow scenarios concerned. Another, complementary and distinguishing theme, is the plethora of extensive exercises we have included. These are styled progressively and aimed to complement the main theory and examples in the respective chapters\"--",

            "title": "Peace Through Law : The Versailles Peace Treaty and Dispute Settlement After World War I",
            "abstract": "With the benefit of hindsight, presenting the Treaty of Versailles as an example of \u2018peace through law\u2019 might seem like a provocation. And yet, the extreme variety and innovativeness of international procedural and substantial \u2018experiments\u2019 attempted as a result of the Treaty of Versailles and the other Paris Peace Treaties of 1919\u20131920 remain striking even today. While many of these \u2018experiments\u2019 had a lasting impact on international law and dispute settlement after the Second World War, and considerably broadened the very idea of \u2018peace through law\u2019, they have often disappeared from collective memories. Relying on both legal and historical research, this book provides a global overview of how the Paris Peace Treaties impacted on dispute resolution in the interwar period, both substantially and procedurally. The book\u2019s accounts of several all-but-forgotten international tribunals and their case law include references to archival records and photographic illustrations",

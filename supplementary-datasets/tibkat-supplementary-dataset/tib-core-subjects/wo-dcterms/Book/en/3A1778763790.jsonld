            "abstract": "China\u2019s prosperity is at the core of the emerging Platinum Age of global economic growth. Rapid economic growth has been underpinned by expansion in its domestic markets, and the integration of domestic and international markets in goods, services, capital, labour and foreign exchange. Global commodity prices have reached historic highs, while China\u2019s capital outflows have helped to hold down interest rates worldwide. Linking markets, both domestic and international, has been key to China\u2019s success. In sustaining its strong economic growth, China has become one of the world\u2019s most voracious consumers of energy. The challenge now facing the government and people of China is in achieving cooperation with the international community to avert the costs\u2013both economic and environmental\u2013of accelerating energy consumption.  China\u2013Linking Markets for Growth gathers together leading scholars on China\u2019s economic success and its effect on the world economy into the next few decades",

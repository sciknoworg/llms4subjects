            "abstract": "\"Human Computer Interaction is used in all areas of our daily lives as a result of the rapid development of technology and computer systems. Human Computer Interaction is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the design and implementation of interactive technologies. The field of Human Computer Interaction is related to many areas such as human behavior, psychology, cognitive sciences, computer technologies, software engineering, ergonomics, graphic / industrial design, sociology and educational sciences. Researchers of this subject both observe the interaction of people with computers and design different technologies and examine the interaction of people with these technologies. The Human Computer Interaction system has four main components: user, task, tool, context. Human Computer Interaction aims to develop interactive technologies through design, evaluation and implementation processes. The development of interactive technologies depends on usability. Usability can be determined by evaluating effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction together. Effectiveness includes how much users can accomplish the tasks they are expected to do using the application; efficiency, how long the user has done the job; Satisfaction refers to the measure of the user's ideas when using the application. One of the major shortcomings in HCI is the transformation of theoretical knowledge into practice. The purpose of the book is to introduce students, teachers, researchers, and practitioners to new advances in HCI. The book includes theoretical and practical studies prepared with the academic contributions of scientists working in different fields. It was decided to publish each chapter in the book after being examined by the scientific board. As an editor, my duty is to ensure breadth, while the chapter authors treat the delegated chapters with depth. The book is designed for practitioners or researchers of all levels of expertise from novice to expert. Each of the book's individual topics could be considered as a compact, self-contained mini-book right under its title. The approach is to provide a framework and a set of techniques for evaluating and improving HCI. It presents a specific set of solutions, mostly obtained from real world projects and experimental studies, for routine applications. It further highlights promising emerging techniques for research and exploration opportunities. The development team of this book wanted to thank their colleagues who made  ...",

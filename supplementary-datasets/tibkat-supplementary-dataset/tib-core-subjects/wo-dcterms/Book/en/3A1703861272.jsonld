            "abstract": "The world of materials is exciting because new materials are evolving daily. After an introduction to materials science, the book addresses the classification and structure of matter. It moves on to discuss crystal and mechanical properties. Next, the book employs various materials such as semiconductors and iron wires to teach concepts such as electrical conductivity, heat conductivity and allotropes. Corrosion is addressed and a chapter dedicated to interpretation of graphs and diagrams in materials science is presented. The book then progresses with chapters on ceramics, biomaterials, polymers and composites. To address the growing importance of recycling materials, polymer identification codes are explained. Interesting topics such as accidental materials discovery and materials failure are included. Each chapter ends with a chapter summary and questions and answers. Illustrations and worked examples are provided throughout. A lab manual is included as well. Presents an broad overview of materials science topics, including such topics as: crystal and mechanical properties of materials, semiconductors and iron wires, corrosion, ceramics, biomaterials, polymers, and composite materials; Examines modern-day materials, their synthesis, properties, alteration, and applications; Includes supplemental material, such as a lab manual and examples.",

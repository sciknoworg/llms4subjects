            "abstract": "Recent advancements in computer technology have allowed for designers to have direct control over the production process through the help of computer-based tools, creating the possibility of a completely integrated design and manufacturing process. Over the last few decades, \"artificial intelligence\" (AI) techniques, such as machine learing and deep learning, have been topics of interest in computer-based design and manufacturing research fields. However, efforts to develop computer-based AI to handle big data in design and manufacturing have not yet been successful. This Special Issue aims to collect novel articles covering artificial intelligence-based design, manufacturing, and data-driven design. It will comprise academics, researchers, mechanical, manufacturing, production and industrial engineers and professionals related to engineering design and manufacturing",

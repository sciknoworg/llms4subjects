            "abstract": "The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) and the Superintendence of Financial Entities (SEFyC) are to be commended on their thorough supervision, their implementation of risk-based supervision, and their thorough examination process. Since the 2001-2002 crises, financial sector indicators have improved significantly and the banking system weathered well the impact of the global financial crisis, with high capital levels, the introduction of a capital buffer, and low Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). This assessment of the state of compliance with the Basel Core Principles (BCPs) in Argentina has been undertaken as part of a World Bank Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) mission. The assessment was conducted from May 11 to 26, 2011. It reflects the banking supervision practices of the BCRA as of the end of April 2011. The assessment is based on the following sources: (i) a complete self-assessment prepared by the BCRA; (ii) detailed interviews with the BCRA staff; (iii) review of laws, regulations, and other documentation on the supervisory framework and on the structure and development of the Argentine banking sector; and (iv) meetings with individual banks, the banking associations, the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance (MECON), external auditors, and financial think tanks. This assessment is based solely on the laws, supervisory requirements, and practices that were in place at the time it was conducted",

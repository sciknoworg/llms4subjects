                "This book provides recent research on soft computing and fuzzy methodologies in innovation management and sustainability. The uncertainty in the business world is increasing. Significant changes are generated unexpectedly, so using fuzzy logic and soft computing methods allows us to create flexible scenarios adaptable to new realities. Within the book, we will find different applications of fuzzy methodologies that can apply to various topics such as sustainability, innovation, tourism, costs, exports, systems administration, among others. The book's main contribution is the applicability of the various methodologies to specific cases, which allows generating a relationship between theory and practice. In addition, it has some bibliometric studies on various topics that give us a visualization of what has happened and where multiple topics are headed. This book is recommended mainly for students who wish to know how the various fuzzy and soft computing tools can be taken to real situations, allowing a better understanding of these and generating new visions of future applicability. ."

            "abstract": "This volume contains the conference contributions of scientists of the SFB 1070 pre-sented at the conference 'Waters as a Resource', which was organized in cooperation with DEGUWA (Deutsche Gesellschaft zur F\u00f6rderung der Unterwasserarch\u00e4ologie e.V.) and took place in T\u00fcbingen from March 15th to 18th 2018. The conference proceedings focus on different resources provided by waters or on the ResourceComplexes connected to them. After a brief reflection on theories and meth-ods used within the SFB 1070 to study and understand resources, conceptions of wa-ter bodies in cultural anthropology and archaeology are compared using the examples of the Guadalquivir and Syr Darya Rivers. The third contribution investigates water management on islands and its influences on the identity of the islanders. The fourth chapter shows how seclusion on islands can be an important resource for island com-munities in the Strait of Sicily. Waters as means for identity formation in medieval monasteries is the focus of the fifth chapter, which is followed by a contribution that investigates the impact of maritime food sources on Viking Life. The last study an a-lyses Greek settlements in the Black Sea. All contributions illustrate how a new per-spective on resources opens up new possibilities for interpretation",

                "\"Preface What is RCA? It seems like such an easy question to answer yet from novices to veterans and practitioners to providers, we cannot seem to agree (nor come to consensus on) on an acceptable definition for the industry. Why? We will discuss our beliefs as to why it is so hard to get such consensus and why various providers are reluctant for that to happen. Many who will read this text are seeking to learn the basics about what is involved with conducting an RCA. Many veterans will peruse this text seeking to see if they can find any pearls of conventional wisdom that they do not already know or dispute and debate our philosophies. This creates a very broad spectrum of expectation that we will try and accommodate. However, in the end, success shall be defined by the demonstration of quantifiable results and not on adherence to the approach of favor. We have tried to write this text in a conversational style because we believe that is a format that most \"rooticians\" can relate to. Basically we are writing like we are teaching a workshop. Readers will find that much of our experience comes not only from the practicing of RCA in the field, but moreso from our experiences with the over 10,000 analysts that we have taught and mentored over the years. Additionally, we participate on many on-line discussion forums where we interact with beginners, veterans and most providers for the betterment of the RCA field. We will list these sources in this text in the hopes that our readers will join and also participate in progressing our common field of study. \"--",

While past editions have focused on Failure Modes and Effects Analysis and Opportunity Analysis, this new edition emphasizes evidence collection and strategy and the contribution of human performance and human factors to poor decision making and understanding the human element. New topics covered include PROACTOnDemand, the advantages of SaaS, RCA templates, as well as various case studies illustrating RCA\"--"

            "abstract": "\"For courses in Introduction to Research Methods (Educational Research) Comprehensive yet accessible The updated Eleventh Edition of Educational Research: Competencies for Analysis and Applications introduces research mainly at a how-to skill and application level. A total instructional system, the book includes stated learning outcomes, instruction, and procedures for evaluating each outcome. It supports readers as they develop expertise in research, learning key concepts and skills and becoming involved in the research process itself. The authors take a down-to-earth approach that helps the reader become both an educational researcher and a competent consumer of educational research.  From reviews of the book:Entire text is very accessible through both language and visual aids; easy to understand examples for nearly every situation described in the text; beginning researchers will appreciate the attentiveness to context, while more experienced students will find a comprehensive text that expertly connects the many intertwining elements of the research process. Lauren Saenz, Boston College [T]he numerous summary tables organize and consolidate the material in one convenient place . end-of-chapter summaries are especially well done presented in a topical format [and help] students to review the material end-of-chapter tasks [are] especially helpful to students who dont quite know how to get started on the task. Dwight R. Gard, Texas Tech University [T]he authors writing style is instructive, engaging and at a level that is appropriate for any graduate student seeking a general understanding of research methods. The objectives and summary tables at the beginning of the chapter focus the students attention on the important ideas numbered steps and examples provide clarification, especially where procedures are involved. The tasks and examples presented at the end of the chapter add relevancy to the chapter topics. Jann W. MacInnes, University of Florida\"",

                "\u201cAn indispensable addition to the literature on interest group and political representation. This book provides a unique perspective on the role of interest groups in Portugal and their implications for political representation, and it does so from a rich comparative perspective that illuminates the challenges and prospects for the study of Portuguese interest groups and beyond. A must read for anyone interested in political representation.\u201d \u2014Sebasti\u00e1n Royo, Provost and Professor of Political Science, Clark University, USA \u201cBased on considerable collective research, Marco Lisi and his research team can provide new theoretical insights into the relationship between interest intermediation and political representation. Furthermore, the book is the most comprehensive empirical study of the field in Portugal from a comparative perspective to date. The work also highlights Portuguese interest groups' changing logic of action in an increasingly integrated European Union multilevel arena. This new book is an indispensable, comprehensive addition to the still under-researched field of interest groups and lobbying in southern Europe.\u201d \u2014Jos\u00e9 M. Magone, Professor in Regional and Global Governance, Berlin School of Economics and Law, Germany This book examines the characteristics and evolution of interest groups in Portugal. Drawing from a wide array of sources - including surveys, parliamentary activities, media coverage and interviews with MPs and lobbyists \u2013 it systematically assesses interest group politics. The book analyses the main features of group population, the strategies utilised by organised interests, their interactions with key decision-makers, and citizens\u2019 opinions regarding their role in the political system. The original data provided in this book frames the Portuguese case in a broader European context, and will be extremely useful for international comparisons. It will appeal to scholars and students of European politics, interest groups, democratic theories, and public policy. Marco Lisi is Associate Professor in the Department of Political Studies, Nova University of Lisbon, and researcher at IPRI-NOVA, Portugal. His research interests include political parties, interest groups, electoral behavior, party systems, political representation and election campaigns. .",

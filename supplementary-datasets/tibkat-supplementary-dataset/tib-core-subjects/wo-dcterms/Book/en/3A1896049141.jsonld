                "This book presents a universal picture of the impact of climate change on food production, diversity, and concerns regarding food safety. The book also highlights the traditional and modern techniques for sustainably improving the production of food crops and their nutritional quality aligning with the \u201czero hunger\u201d goal (Sustainable Development Goal 2) of the United Nations. The book holistically includes the contributions of scientists and academicians working in the fields of Food and Nutrition, Plant and Microbial Sciences, Agriculture, etc. The book also offers insights into the strategies adopted worldwide for ensuring food availability and safety, taking the aid of advanced technologies like climate-smart agriculture along with nanotechnology and artificial intelligence in the event of climate change. Above all, the book transpires the subject matter using illustrative figures and outlines and therefore will be an asset for the post-graduate students, researchers, and faculties.",

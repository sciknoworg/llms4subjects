            "abstract": "\"The ISO Innovation Management System (IMS) Standard (ISO 56002) provides a much needed and well-timed input to the innovation management discipline. While research efforts within the domain of innovation management have vastly increased over the past decades, research has primarily been conducted through specific contributions to distinct areas of innovation management (e.g. top management, culture, processes), lacking a more holistic perspective. Practitioners know that managing innovation is challenging. Bringing in a globally recognised standard that offers a holistic perspective will be key in professionalising the innovation management discipline, much like quality management and project management standards have done in the past. This book focuses on the ISO Innovation Management System Standard and the links with ISPIM's Body of Knowledge (BoK) special interest group, the ISO innovation management community, and the International Collaboration Platform for Innovation Management System (ICP4IMS). It covers four topics as follows: Introduction to a systems approach for innovation management and the ISO Innovation Management System Standard (ISO 56002), including historical context, descriptions of terms, typology, and the clauses in the Standard. Elaboration of the innovation management fundamentals and principles (ISO 56000). Features sixteen case studies of diverse organisations from around the globe, including those that have implemented a management system before the Standard was released and those following it now, completely or partially. Lessons learned and implications, including insights for how to take innovation management to its next level to address opportunities and challenges in organisations and societies\"--",

Vampires is Radakovi\u0107\u2019s fictionalized account of a Serb living in Cologne, Germany while his former country disintegrates. He travels in the American West, ostensibly looking for the vampires causing chaos in his own country, and then returns to Europe, having found no vampires. It is a dark text, a story of destruction told in a narrative that refuses all the solaces narrative has traditionally afforded. A Reasonable Dictionary is Abbott\u2019s personally troubled account of his and Radakovi\u0107\u2019s trip up the Drina River between the civil wars, a journey made with the novelist Peter Handke, a trip during which some of Abbott\u2019s specifically American stories lost their moral structure",

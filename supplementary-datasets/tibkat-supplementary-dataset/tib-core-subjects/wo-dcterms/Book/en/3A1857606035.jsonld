            "abstract": "\"This new volume applies the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to solving problems and challenges in manufacturing environments. In real-time life applications, MCDM has gained vast popularity for its ability to help make decisions in the presence of various similar and conflicting choices. The volume discusses using MCDM computational methods to evaluate and select the most optimal solution or method to real-world manufacturing engineering issues. It details the decision-making process in relation to many manufacturing aspects, including materials selection; identification, assessment, and evaluation of risk; sustainability assessment; selection of green suppliers; and more. The chapter authors demonstrate the application of myriad MCDM techniques in decision-making, including MADM (multiple attribute decision-making), DEA (data envelopment analysis), fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarities to ideal solution), fuzzy-VIKOR (multicriteria optimization and compromise solution); MOORA (multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis), EWM (entropy weight method), (AHP) analytic hierarchy process, TODIM (TOmada de Decisao Interativa Multicriterio), and others. The volume illustrates these MCDM models in several industries and industrial processes, including for experimental analysis and optimization of drilling of glass fiber reinforced plastic, in the textile industries, for selection of refrigerants for domestic applications, and others. The wide range of topics in Decision-Making Models and Applications in Manufacturing Environments will be valuable for researchers in manufacturing fields who need to use the latest developments and trends in decision-making processes. Professionals as well as faculty and students in manufacturing, industrial, mechanical and production technologies will be able to use, apply, and implement the MCDM models presented in this book\"",

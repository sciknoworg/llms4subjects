                "This book was written by a team of leading gear experts from across the globe, including contributions from USA, Germany, Poland, China, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. It provides readers with the latest accomplishments in the gear theory and gear cutting tool design. Specialists can apply competencies gained from this book to quality control in gear manufacture, as well as to the conditions of their production. The book begins with a detailed discussion of the kinematics and geometry of geometrically-accurate gears and gear systems. This is followed by an analysis of state-of-the-art gear manufacturing methods with focus on gear finishing operations. Novel designs of gear transmission systems as well as gear theory and gear cutting tool design are also covered. ."

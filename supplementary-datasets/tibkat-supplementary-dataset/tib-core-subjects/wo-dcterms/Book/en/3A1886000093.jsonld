            "abstract": "\"This book introduces MXenes and provides a summary of current discoveries in their synthesis, properties, characterization techniques, and emerging applications in several fields. It explores the MXenes' distinctive electrical, mechanical, and biological features, as well as their applications. It discusses the various emerging applications of MXenes in a variety of fields, including regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, separation membranes, photocatalytic hydrogen production, environmental applications, and so forth. Features: Provides comprehensive review of synthesis and application of Mxene in 2D materials. Explores greener approaches that reduce the environmental impact and cost of the process. Includes frameworks for assessing the balance between the synthesis and applications. Discusses overview of MXene with a focus on energy, health and medical applications that can be improved with new encapsulation. Reviews understanding of the modern spectroscopic instruments that are utilized in sophisticated characterization methods. This book is aimed at researchers and graduate students in materials engineering, nanomaterials, and 2D materials\"--",

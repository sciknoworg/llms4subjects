            "title": "New Achievements in Evolutionary Computation",
            "abstract": "Evolutionary computation has been widely used in computer science for decades. Even though it started as far back as the 1960s with simulated evolution, the subject is still evolving. During this time, new metaheuristic optimization approaches, like evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence, etc., were being developed and new fields of usage in artificial intelligence, machine learning, combinatorial and numerical optimization, etc., were being explored. However, even with so much work done, novel research into new techniques and new areas of usage is far from over. This book presents some new theoretical as well as practical aspects of evolutionary computation. This book will be of great value to undergraduates, graduate students, researchers in computer science, and anyone else with an interest in learning about the latest developments in evolutionary computation",

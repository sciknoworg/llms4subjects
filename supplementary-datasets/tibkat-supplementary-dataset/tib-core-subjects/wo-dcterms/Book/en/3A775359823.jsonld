            "abstract": "This textbook provides an introduction to the fundamentals of space physics and astrophysics and covers the recent progress in various aspects of these fields. In the introductory Chapter 1, a brief historical account of space research is given, followed by short reviews of the space vehicles used and some aspects of the early years of space research. In Chapter 2, the reader is introduced to the discoveries of the radiation belts and the magnetosphere of the Earth. Chapter 3 begins with the phenomena of the quiet Sun, followed by processes in the active Sun (solar flares, radio bursts and X-ray, gamma-ray and neutron emissions). In Chapters 4 and 5, attention is paid to the physical features and properties of large bodies and aggregates in the matter of the solar system, emphasising discoveries obtained from spacecraft. In Chapter 6 solar energetic particles are presented, bringing out their dual role - as a sample of accelerated matter from the Sun and as a sensitive probe of the interplanetary fields in the heliosphere. Chapter 7 presents a discussion on galactic cosmic rays, explaining the basic features and main findings. Highlights of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and possible origins are included. Chapter 8 presents exciting results of extreme UV, infra-red, X-rays and gamma-rays from space. These are followed by outlines of the new vistas of cosmological problems as revealed by the cosmic background measurements of X-rays, gamma-rays and microwaves. In Chapter 9, the reader is introduced to the physical and dynamical properties of the interstellar medium. This chapter concludes with the astrophysical aspects of the search for the origin of life. In the concluding Chapter 10 some general trends and future directions are briefly presented. The level of presentation is aimed at senior undergraduate students who are familiar with introductory physics. Graduate students will find more advanced topics discussed through their underlying features. Each chapter is followed by a number of problems; solving these will enable students to obtain a good grasp of the topics",

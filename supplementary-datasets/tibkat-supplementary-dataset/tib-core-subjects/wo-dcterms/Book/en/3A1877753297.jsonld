In particular, this Special Issue of the peer-reviewed international journal Sustainability aspires to expand the discussion and scientific debate on a range of viewpoints, trends, approaches, cases, impacts, challenges, models, and/or frameworks relating to tourism in the time of COVID-19, as well as the possibility of implementing the principles of sustainable tourism development in the post-pandemic period. Restarting the frozen tourism economy is an opportunity to build healthy relations between various groups of tourism stakeholders, including entrepreneurs and tourists. \"New tourism\" also requires legal and organizational solutions in order to balance the economic relations between global and local market actors in terms of consumer protection, as well as prevent the phenomenon of overtourism. The digitization of tourism services in the areas of marketing and sales should be one of the priorities addressed by entrepreneurs and DMOs. In the literature, as well as in the media and the scientific community, the impact of the pandemic on tourism has been the most commonly discussed topic over the last two years. This Special Issue aims to explore further sustainable tourism practices",

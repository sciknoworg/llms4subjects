                "\"Routledge Handbook of Descriptive Rhetorical Studies and World Languages offers a useful collection of papers that present rhetorical analysis of the discoursal practice in different cultural settings. Covering issues from America to Europe and Asia, and topics from politics to media, education to science, agriculture to literature and so on, the handbook offers something to everyone interested in knowing how language works to guide listeners' interpretations, alter their perceptions and shape their worldviews. The outcome will be a huge number of publications describing the rhetorical conventions and innovations in many walks of life in the global setting. Eventually, a body of knowledge and theory about rhetoric will be formed as a result of increasingly pervasive descriptive rhetorical studies around the globe. The end result is a knowledge database, a solid foundation for rhetorical studies to become an essential discipline in arts and humanities from which to develop formidable theory and applications in areas such as linguistics, literature, history, cultural studies, political science, and sociology. This handbook will be crucial for students and researchers in areas such as literature and linguistics, communication studies, political science, and arts and humanities in general. This book will also be useful to social science, educational, business, law, science and engineering departments, due to its coverage of rhetoric in a multidisciplinary and multilingual context\"--",

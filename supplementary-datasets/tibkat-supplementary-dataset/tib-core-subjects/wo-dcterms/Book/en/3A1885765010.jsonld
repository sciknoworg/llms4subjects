            "abstract": "Acetylcholine - Recent Advances and New Perspectives describes research related to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine was discovered as a neurotransmitter about 100 years ago. Still, researchers around the world study this important signaling molecule in terms of its chemistry, biochemistry, function in the central and peripheral nervous system, and relevance for neurological disorders and diseases. This book focuses on the role of acetylcholine in individual nerve cells, neural circuits, and specific brain regions. In addition, the book illustrates acetylcholine from historical perspectives to technological advances, as well as the use of novel tools in health and disease, in various animal models and organisms. As an added benefit, chapters in the book describe acetylcholine in its relation to paraoxonase enzymes, acetylcholine esterase, neurotoxins, and organophosphorus compounds. Furthermore, this book provides an overview of the work that is being done on acetylcholine and highlights any gaps and areas that would benefit from further exploration. It is a useful resource for students and researchers in biological, chemical, medical, and history disciplines",

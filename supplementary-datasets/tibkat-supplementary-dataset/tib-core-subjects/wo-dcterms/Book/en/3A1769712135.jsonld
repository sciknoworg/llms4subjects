            "abstract": "\u201cSmall states can make a big difference for an entire region not only for their potential nuicence value, but also for their active contributions to uphold international order from a neutral or buffer-state position. This book is very valuable for its concrete discussions of exactly how this has played out, particularly in post-Cold War Europe.\u201d \u2013Iver B. Neumann, Co-editor of Small State Status-Seeking \u201cArguably, most of the states of the world are neither great powers nor middle powers, rather small states. Most of these small states are not members of military alliances. In her book, Radoman, goes in-depth analysing this universal phenomenon, hence presenting new and most welcomed knowledge. She presents valuable insights in the fields of Foreign Policy Analysis as well as Strategic Studies.\u201d \u2013H\u00e5kan Edstr\u00f6m, Associate Professor in Political Science and Senior Lecturer in War Studies, Swedish National Defence University, Stockholm, Sweden \u201cIf you want to know why states still opt for military neutrality in the twenty-first century, this is a book for you! To explain how two very different states, Sweden and Serbia, adopted a similar policy, Radoman draws on an eclectic theoretical framework. The book will also be a real treat for anyone interested in small states and their defense policies and European security more generally.\u201d \u2013 Filip Ejdus, Associate Professor, Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade, Serbia This book explores the factors that account for military neutrality as a security strategy for small states. Through comparing the cases of Serbia and Sweden the book introduces a novel conceptual framework that is built against existing knowledge in the small states and military neutrality literature. Drawing on different theoretical frameworks, the model explains why certain small states choose to stay outside of military alliances in the twenty-first century. Jelena Radoman holds a PhD in International Relations from the University of Belgrade, Serbia. Her work is related to security sector reform and security integrations. She currently works for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Embassy in Belgrade.",

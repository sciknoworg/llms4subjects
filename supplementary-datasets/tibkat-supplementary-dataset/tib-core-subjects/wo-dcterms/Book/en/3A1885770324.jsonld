            "abstract": "Selected Essays and Dialogues is a collection of translations of Italian writer and filmmaker Gianni Celati\u2019s theoretical and musing work from the late 1960s to the present. Topics range from environmental perception and archaeological conceptions of historical knowledge, to street theatre, writing, photography, cinema and translation. The book provides a framework of key literary, theoretical and artistic movements of the last 50 years, as well as a guide for English-language readers to place Celati\u2019s work in historical, cultural and biographical context, serving to illuminate his books available in English, namely Towards the River\u2019s Mouth, Adventures in Africa, Voices from the Plains and Appearances.  There are various paths to take, tempting readers to wander and become lost in webs of daring thought, drawn ever on by Celati\u2019s fondness for the unexpected ordinary and his bonhomie with others. Indeed, a genial adventurousness can be found within all of Celati\u2019s writings collected here, driven by an affectionate and light-hearted engagement with the surrounding world. Herein is a taste of a seemingly endless series of adventures of the mind and body, always tapped into a lithe sensitivity for an encompassing collective imagination not restricted to the so-called high arts or letters, but very much also engaged with the everyday lives, places and tales we all constantly share.  Praise for Selected Essays and Dialogues by Gianni Celati  \u2018Barron\u2019s volume is a very welcome addition to the field. As the first collection of Gianni Celati\u2019s essays in English translation, the book makes accessible a wide selection of his critical work to an Anglophone audience.\u2019 Marina Spunta, University of Leicester",

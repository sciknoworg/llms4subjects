            "abstract": "This report is the final product of a project financed by a grant from the World Bank's Youth Innovation Fund developed in conjunction with representatives of the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) spanning the period December 2011-June 2012. The report is an advisory document to assist the GoSL in advancement of its Public Sector Reform Program, particularly the initiative improving productivity through management and pay reforms. It provides the Public Service Commission (PSC) and Human Resource Management Office (HRMO) with options for the design and implementation of an entry-level leadership development program (ELDP) for the civil service, currently slated for implementation in 2014 as per government timelines. This program is herein referred to as the Sierra Leone Public Service Fellowship (SLPSF). The purpose of this document is address the identified organizational gap by offering technical guidance on the creation of a civil service fellowship that cultivates promising young professionals as future leaders. The proposed program targets university students in their final year of study and entices them to apply for graduate entry-level positions through a dedicated outreach effort and series of incentives. It selects candidates through a rigorous multi-stage assessment and matches successful candidate's interests with the needs of the Ministry, Department, or Agency (MDAs). It trains selected fellows in core civil service knowledge as well as a range of generalist functions and technical skills. It also offers fellows the opportunity to rotate in three different MDAs throughout the two-year period to develop a whole of government perspective. Throughout this initiative, the program offers fellows access to senior Government leaders and opportunities to grow professionally building a strong foundation for a successful career as a civil servant. Additionally, the program is bolstered by a number of public relations opportunities to raise its profile and showcase its achievements to Sierra Leoneans within and outside of Government",

            "abstract": "Food biopolymers: Structural, functional and nutraceutical properties provides valuable coverage of all major food biopolymers of from plant, animal and marine sources. The text focuses on the structural characteristics of biopolymers including starch, non-starch polysaccharides, proteins and fats. A full section is dedicated to the nutraceutical potential and applications of these polymers. Further sections provide comprehensive overviews of the development of functional food products and important data on biopolymer behavior and nutraceutical potential during processing. Researchers hoping to gain a basic understanding of the techno-functional, nutraceutical potential and applications of food biopolymers will find a singular source with this text. The first section of this work focuses on the the structure, functions, bioactivity and applications of starches. The next chapters cover non-starch polysaccharides. Further sections are dedicated to proteins, lipids and oils. A detailed overview is provided for each, followed by application procedures, specifics on individual types, proteins and enzymes, and nutraceutical properties. This work can be used as a singular source for all relevant information on food biopolymers and their structural and functional properties, including their potential to increase food quality, improve shelf life, and reduce pollution and waste in the food industry. .",

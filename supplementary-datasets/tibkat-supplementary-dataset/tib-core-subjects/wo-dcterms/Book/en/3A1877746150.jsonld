            "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a unique tool to probe the biochemistry in vivo providing metabolic information non-invasively. Applications using MRS has been found over a broad spectrum in investigating the underlying structures of compounds as well as in determining disease states. In this book, topics of MRS both relevant to the clinic and also those that are beyond the clinical arena are covered. The book consists of two sections. The first section is entitled 'MRS inside the clinic' and is focused on clinical applications of MRS while the second section is entitled 'MRS beyond the clinic' and discusses applications of MRS in other academic fields. Our hope is that through this book, readers can understand the broad applications that NMR and MRS can offer and also that there are enough references to guide the readers for further study in this important topic",

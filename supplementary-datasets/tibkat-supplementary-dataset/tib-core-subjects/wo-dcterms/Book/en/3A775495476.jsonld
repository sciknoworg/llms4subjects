                "The main part of this volume is composed of papers commissioned for the Energy Pricing Policy Workshop held at Bangkok from 8 to 11 May 1984, co-ordinated by the U nited Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Resource Systems Institute of the East-West Center. The Workshop, which involved high-level policy planners was financially sponsored by several from several Asian developing countries, organizations: the ESCAP Regional Energy Development Programme funded by the United Nations Development Programme; the European Economic Community; the International Labour Organisation; and the International Development Research Centre. Publication of these papers has been supported by funds from the European Economic Community and the United States Agency for International Development. Preparation of the manuscripts for publication was undertaken at the East-West Center, through contribution in kind at the professional, editorial, and support staff levels. out of discussions at the Eighth Session of the The Workshop developed ESCAP Committee on Natural Resources, 27 October to 2 November 1981, where questions on resource pricing in general (as related to energy resources) and sectoral pricing policies for end-users were discussed in the context of demand management. It was recognized that, although much work had been done in the area, policy makers could seldorn obtain analytically supported, yet realistic, guidance concerning energy pricing questions. The emphasis of the Workshop was, therefore, on policy decision-making, and the application of theory to policy formulation in the energy pricing area."

                "This book presents a guide to digital twin technologies and their applications within manufacturing. It examines key technological advances in the area of Industry 4.0, including numerical and experimental models and the Internet of Things (IoT), and explores their potential technical benefits through real-world application examples. This book presents digital models of advanced manufacturing processes dynamics that enable to control the cutting processes including experimental and simulation studies for brittle-ductile transition of ultra-precision machining materials assuring product quality. Innovative electrical power harvesting solutions from tool vibrations and wireless data transmission from confined and heavily cooled environment are also included. It explains the benefits of virtual and physical twins adapted to real systems, including the ability to shorten the product's path to the market, and enabling the transition to higher value-added manufacturing processes. Including numerous illustrations and clear solved problems, this book will be of interest to researchers and industry professionals in the fields of mechatronics, manufacturing engineering, computational mechanics.",

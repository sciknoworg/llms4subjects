                "\"Employee relations in national contexts are significantly influenced not only by material forces but also by cultural and linguistic factors that are often highly nationally specific. In this innovative book, culture and language are analysed in terms of how they affect employee relations internationally, demonstrating the importance of recognising and understanding these elements in the face of increasing globalisation. International Comparative Employee Relations first examines the subject from a broader international perspective, discussing the impact of cultural context on common areas such as labour law and collective bargaining, and exploring the issues of translating these concepts, as well as surveying current scholarship in the field. In later chapters, case studies from China, Italy, Germany, the USA and Nigeria provide specific examples of the cultural and linguistic complexity and diversity of employee relations both within and between nations. Scholars and students of international business management, particularly those with an interest in comparative employment relations or comparative human resource management, will find this book insightful. It will also prove useful for practitioners working in areas such as cross-cultural management and translation\"--"

                "This book summarizes the basic theory of wavelets and some related algorithms in an easy-to-understand language from the perspective of an engineer rather than a mathematician. In this book, the wavelet solution schemes are systematically established and introduced for solving general linear and nonlinear initial boundary value problems in engineering, including the technique of boundary extension in approximating interval-bounded functions, the calculation method for various connection coefficients, the single-point Gaussian integration method in calculating the coefficients of wavelet expansions and unique treatments on nonlinear terms in differential equations. At the same time, this book is supplemented by a large number of numerical examples to specifically explain procedures and characteristics of the method, as well as detailed treatments for specific problems. Different from most of the current monographs focusing on the basic theory of wavelets, it focuses on the use of wavelet-based numerical methods developed by the author over the years. Even for the necessary basic theory of wavelet in engineering applications, this book is based on the author\u2019s own understanding in plain language, instead of a relatively difficult professional mathematical description. This book is very suitable for students, researchers and technical personnel who only want to need the minimal knowledge of wavelet method to solve specific problems in engineering. .",

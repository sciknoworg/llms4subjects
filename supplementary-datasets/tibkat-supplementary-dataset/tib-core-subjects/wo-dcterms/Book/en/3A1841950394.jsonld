                "This book presents South Asian women\u2019s voices which have been marginalised in the conceptualization of international relations in the region. It highlights critical issues of importance for women which are often neglected in traditional International Relations studies. Embracing Feminist epistemology and \u2018situated knowledge\u2019, the book re-imagines the theory and practice of International Relations in South Asia, placing women\u2019s experiences at the centre. Refusing the temptation to typecast women, the book showcases the varied reflections of South Asian women in international relations with contributions from an eclectic set of authors from different nationalities. In doing so, the book expands the ontological and epistemological horizons of International Relations by including issues like caste, conflict, and social movements. While some of these are uniquely South Asian, all of them show how the field of IR in general can be enriched by being more inclusive. This book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students, as it provides a fresh re-conceptualization of International Relations from gender as well as global south perspective.

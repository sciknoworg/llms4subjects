            "title": "Lessons from Poland, Insights for Poland : A Sustainable and Inclusive Transition to High Income Status",
            "abstract": "This report discusses Poland's experience along five dimensions. These five dimensions - a pentagon of policies and institutions are governing, sustaining, connecting, growing, and including. The main lessons from Poland and the key insights for its future, based on this pentagon, are presented in the lessons and insights summarized in this report. Poland's experience underlines the importance of a shared vision to sustain continuing reforms. Poland's rapid economic ascent created new challenges: the creative destruction on which the growth process was based, successfully, caused massive social change. The report addresses two sets of questions. First, what are the lessons from Poland's remarkable transition to high income?; what policies were behind Poland's economic achievements?; why was Poland able to achieve high-income per capita so fast, while many other countries remained in the upper-middle-income range for decades - trapped middle-income countries (MICs)?; what policies were similar to those pursued by other new high income countries (HICs) and what were specific to Poland?, and second, what are the insights for Poland going forward? Given international experience and Poland's characteristics, what policies can it adopt to continue its ascent and reach the much higher incomes of countries that have been high income for a considerable period - the established HICs?",

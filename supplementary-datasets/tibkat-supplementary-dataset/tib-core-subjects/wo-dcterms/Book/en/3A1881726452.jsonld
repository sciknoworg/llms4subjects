            "abstract": "This report is intended to inform public debate and policymaking on income inequality in Thailand. It aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of income inequality in Thailand and identify opportunities to promote more inclusive growth. The analysis uses a wealth of data from a variety of sources (detailed in Appendix A) to examine the pattern, structure, and drivers of income inequality in the country, with a special focus on inequality and labor market supply-side factors. It is structured as follows. This section has laid the foundation for analysis, examining historical trends in both consumption - and income-based measures of inequality while providing geographic context and data on public perceptions about inequality. It also provided a summary of literature findings. Section 2 analyzes the pandemic's impacts on inequality, including the role that social assistance played in mitigating its effects but also the potential scarring effects on children's human capital development. Section 3 examines the structural drivers of inequality and its persistence, focusing on the role of inequality of opportunity in human capital development and access to basic services. Finally, Section 4 provides policy options to create a more inclusive society by addressing the root causes of persistent inequality and mitigating the challenges brought about by the pandemic. In particular, since a significant share of the poor in Thailand are engaged in agriculture, the report underscores that improving farm incomes is crucial for alleviating poverty and reducing inequality. As such, Section 4 draws its recommendations from a recent study on the key challenges and opportunities facing Thai farmers to raise agricultural productivity and incomes",

            "abstract": "This chapter explores the relations between women, land, property and the law. The first part of the chapter outlines single, widowed and married women\u2019s legal position as property owners, paying particular attention to the doctrines of primogeniture and coverture and their impact on women\u2019s property rights. It explores the circumstances by which women most commonly became landowners, outlining the four main routes to landownership for women, as well as the practices by which married women were sometimes able to circumvent the restrictions of coverture. As a corollary to this, it also explores the impact of various changes to the early modern legal system \u2013 including the shift from dower to jointure arrangements, the emergence of strict settlement and the declining power of the ecclesiastical courts \u2013 on women\u2019s property rights. The second half of the chapter sets out to assess the significance of women as a class of landowners in Georgian England, quantifying the scale of women\u2019s landholding in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries using a large sample of data drawn from the parliamentary enclosure awards. In doing so, it responds to considerable uncertainty about the scale of women\u2019s property ownership. Little quantitative information is available on the proportion of land owned by women, although a handful of studies have used rentals and leases to examine female landholding \u2013 as opposed to landownership \u2013 within small groups of manors. The results of the sampled enclosure awards are presented below, comparisons between this data and the earlier, smaller studies explored, and the new data used to throw light on four key issues: the legal and marital status of female landowners, the scale of individual female landowners\u2019 holdings, the geography of female landownership and the thorny issue of change over time",

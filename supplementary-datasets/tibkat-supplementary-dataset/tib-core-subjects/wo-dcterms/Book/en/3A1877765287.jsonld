            "abstract": "If we don\u2019t know what the words \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\u201d mean, then we don\u2019t know what democracy is. This book defends a radical view: these words mean nothing and should be abandoned. The argument for abolitionism is simple: those terms are defective and we can easily do better, so let\u2019s get rid of them. According to the abolitionist, the switch to alternative devices would be a significant communicative, cognitive, and political advance. The first part of the book presents a general theory of abandonment: the conditions under which language should be abandoned. The rest of the book applies this general theory to the case of \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\u201d. The book shows that \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\u201d are semantically, pragmatically, and communicatively defective. Abolitionism is not all gloom and doom. It also contains a message of good cheer: we have easy access to conceptual devices that are more effective than \u201cdemocracy\u201d. We can do better. These alternative linguistic devices will enable us to ask better questions, provide genuinely fruitful answers, and have more rational discussions. Moreover, those questions and answers better articulate the communicative and cognitive aims of those who use empty terms such as \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\u201d",

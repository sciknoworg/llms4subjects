            "abstract": "This book includes peer-reviewed articles from the 8th International Conference on Sustainable Urban Development (ICSUD 2022), held at the Vietnamese-German University (VGU) in Vietnam. The theme of the conference is \u201cinnovative and inclusive growth models for sustainable urban development\u201d. Articles in this book present major issues that cities and regions around the world are facing these days to adapt to new, unexpected, and profound challenges. Over past few years, the world has been observing meaningful reactions to crises. From the pandemic to war, energy, and food shortages, there are always opportunities for innovations. Some firms still thrived in the city lock-down; some groups stayed healthier with less income; and certain municipalities consumed less resources to attain higher outcomes. However, the rise of digital economy, the importance of proximity or near-shore supply chain, or the new contribution of different communities at different levels are generalized as new growth models for changes.",

Sometimes the potential problems that could arise are caused by field changes to the physical design and/or operation of equipment. This book is vital to the practicing engineer who must work under the pressures of safe process operation. Unique Methods for Analyzing Failures and Catastrophic Events: An Illustrated Guide for Engineers will be useful to anyone seeking practical insight and relevant case studies to solve an existing problem or to understand how complex engineering problems are solved. Using technical and relatable examples, this book allows the working engineer, technician, trades person or advanced student to make an upfront simplified analysis on their own and better understand the science behind the problem. Not only will readers be equipped to evaluate the content of a consultant's more detailed and complex analysis, they also will be in a better position to suggest a solid path forward to management.\"--",

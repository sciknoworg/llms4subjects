            "title": "Vibration control of vehicle suspension systems",
            "abstract": "\"This book covers complex issues for a vehicle suspension model including non-linearities and uncertainties in a suspension model, network-induced time delays, and sampled-data model from a theoretical point of view. It includes control design methods as neural network supervisory, sliding mode variable structure, and optimal control, internal-model principle, feedback linearization control, input-to-state stabilization, and so forth. Every control method is applied to simulation for comparison and verification. Features: Includes theoretical derivation, proof, and simulation verification combined with suspension models Provides the vibration control strategies for sampled-data suspension models Focuses on the suspensions with time-delays instead of delay-free Covers all the models related to quarter, half, and full-vehicle suspensions Details rigorous mathematical derivation process for each theorem supported by MATLAB\u00ae based simulation This book is aimed at researchers and graduate students in automotive engineering, vehicle vibration, mechatronics, control systems, applied mechanics, and vehicle dynamics\"--",

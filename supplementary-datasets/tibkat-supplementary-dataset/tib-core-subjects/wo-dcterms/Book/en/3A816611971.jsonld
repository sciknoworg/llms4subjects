                "\"Our goal in this book is to provide the best possible information about how to teach writing in the primary grades. Throughout the book, we include evidence-based practices in writing instruction and use the Common Core State Standards as a framework. We have provided resources designed to help teachers evaluate the breadth and depth of their existing curricula. Furthermore, we have offered a range of materials and methods that could be used to supplement an existing writing program or to create one. This book was written to provide insight and materials required for high-quality writing instruction. It is our hope that after teachers read this book, they will be both better informed and more effective writing teachers\"--",
                "\"An essential \"how-to\" primer, this book examines the process of learning to write and shares evidence-based instructional strategies for the primary grades. With an emphasis on explicit instruction and scaffolding students' learning, the authors explain when and how to teach handwriting, spelling, foundational skills such as sentence formation and editing, and composition in specific genres. They present clear-cut techniques for assessment, differentiation, and supporting struggling writers. The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for Writing are used as a framework for setting instructional goals. Reproducible assessment forms, checklists, and rubrics are provided; purchasers get access to a Web page where they can download and print the reproducible materials in a convenient 8 1/2\" x 11\" size\"--"

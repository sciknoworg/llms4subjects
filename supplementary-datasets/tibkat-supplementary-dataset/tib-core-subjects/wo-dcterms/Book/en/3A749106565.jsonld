            "abstract": "Interstellar dust, meteorites, interplanetary dust particles (IDP's), the zodiacal light, comets, comet dust. Where do they come from, what are they made of, how do they evolve, and finally, are there connections between them? These are the questions discussed in this volume by some of the world's outstanding experts in their respective fields. The techniques used for studying the `small' solid objects of space are thoroughly discussed. Some of the methods involve a synthetic approach using the laboratory to create analog environments and materials which are believed to resemble those in space. Others use direct laboratory methods with state-of-the-art analytical tools to study the material of the objects themselves - meteorites, IDP'S. And others apply the latest in astronomical facilities to provide quantitative data on the material properties of the solids which can only be deduced from remote observations, These are compared with the laboratory results. In one instance there was a possibility to study a solar system body in situ and that was the case of comet Halley and some of the results of these studies obtained from space `laboratories' launched to meet it are discussed here. Finally, there are theoretical papers which are aimed at bridging the results of observational and laboratory methods. This book is recommended to senior scientists as well as graduate students who wish to pursue research in interstellar and solar system astronomy and their connections",

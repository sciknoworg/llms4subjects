            "abstract": "\"One-dimensional nanomaterials are emerging as promising materials for their many unique characteristics. This book covers their synthesis and applications in batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, solar cells, green energy production, flexible electronics, electrochemical sensors, and biomedicine. Progress in nanotechnology offers an opportunity to synthesize materials with unique properties. The properties of nanomaterials can be further improved by growing them in one-dimension structural with variations in their architecture. One-dimensional polymeric nanocomposites offer various advantages such as nano dimensions, high surface area, structural stability, and the ability to tune their electrochemical, electronic, and optical properties. The book covers basic concepts, chemistries, properties, and the importance of one-dimensional nanomaterials, along with their wide applications and state-of-the-art progress in the energy, flexible electronics, sensor, and biomedical fields. The fundamentals of electrochemical behavior and their understanding for various applications are also discussed in detail. This book will provide new direction to scientists, researchers, and students to better understand the chemistry, technologies, and applications of one-dimensional polymeric nanocomposites\"--",

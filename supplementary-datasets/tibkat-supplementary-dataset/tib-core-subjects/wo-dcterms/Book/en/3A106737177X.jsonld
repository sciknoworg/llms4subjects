                "This handbook offers a theoretical foundation for the adaptation of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families. The volume examines current treatments for children with ASD and provides a rationale for why PCIT is considered a strong option to address many of the concerns found within this population of children and families. It presents an overview of PCIT theory, the goals of PCIT, the unique aspects of the treatment, and the exceptional outcomes. The handbook demonstrates the versatility of PCIT in conjunction with standard science-based therapies in addressing specific behavioral problems in this young population. Chapters provide a theoretical basis for PCIT, the empirical evidence for its efficacy, clinical considerations, and training issues. Chapters also offer a selection of case studies that help illustrate how PCIT has been successful in treating children with autism. The handbook concludes by identifying the gaps that need to be addressed by future research. Topics featured in the Handbook include: A clinical description of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy. The effects of medication for individuals with ASD. The importance of parent-child interactions in social communication and development. Teaching complex social behavior to children with ASD. Internet-delivered PCIT (I-PCIT) for children with autism. Child-Directed Interaction treatments for children with ASD. Parent-Directed Interaction treatments for children on the autism spectrum. The Handbook of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy for Children on the Autism Spectrum is a must-have resource for researchers, professors, clinicians/practitioners/therapists, and graduate students across many interrelated disciplines, including child and school psychology, behavioral therapy, social work, child and adolescent psychiatry, pediatrics, and family studies as well as occupational therapy, physical therapy, behavior analysis, and speech therapy",

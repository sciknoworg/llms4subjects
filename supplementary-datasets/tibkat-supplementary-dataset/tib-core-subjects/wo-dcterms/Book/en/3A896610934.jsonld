                "Introduction : 'Empire without end' -- 'Carthage must be destroyed' : the dynamics of Roman imperialism -- 'They make a desert and call it peace' : the nature of Roman rule -- 'The emporium of the world' : the economic impact of empire -- 'They call it \"civilisation\"' : the dynamics of cultural change -- Envoi : 'decline and fall'",
                "`A clever re-assessment of Roman imperial achievement. Morley provacatively challenges conventional views on the dynamics of empire. This book should be read by those interested in ancient history and by those who watch for the rise and fall of superstates in the twenty-first century.' Christopher Kelly, Senior Lecturer in Classics, Cambridge University -- `How do empires grow, how are they ruled, do they exploit their subjects or civilise them? Morley's book weaves together modern theories of imperialism with the story of Europe's first, and greatest, empire.' Gregory Woolf, Professor of Ancient History, St. Andrews University -- `Morley's book is not just an acute analysis of the development of one of the most influential of all the world's historical empires, but also a reflection on the power and pitfalls of self-justification through appeal to an imagined past. Discussions of the dynamics of Roman imperialism... are complemented by thoughtful accounts of the economic impact of empire.' Professor Paul A. Cartledge, A.G. Leventis Professor of Greek Culture Cambridge University -- A millenium and a half after the end of its dominance, Rome remains a significant presence in western culture. This book explores what the empire meant to its subjects -- The idea of Rome has long outlived the physical empire that gave it form. It continues to shape our understanding of the nature of imperialism, and thus, however subtly, to influence the workings of the world. Unlike most works on Roman history, this book does not offer a simplistic narrative, with military triumph followed by decline and fall. Instead, it analyses the origins and nature of Roman imperialism, its economic, social and cultural impact on the regions it conquered, and its continuing influence in debates about modern imperialism --Book Jacket"

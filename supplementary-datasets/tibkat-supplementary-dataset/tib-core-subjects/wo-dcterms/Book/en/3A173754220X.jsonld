                "This book presents the results of a three-year comparative study on Chinese cultural diplomacy (CD) across Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, which contributes to the broader theoretical debate on China`s increasing soft power in international relations. The study, \u2018China's Cultural Diplomacy and the Role of Non-State Actors\u2019 was conducted by a research team at the Oriental Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic from 2015 to 2018. This book pays special attention to China\u2019s localized forms of CD, focusing on the regional variations and involvement of non-state actors, especially local actors outside China. Local actors involved in Chinese CD diplomacy are characterized by their intermediary status as working for the aims of two states, while trying to bridge conflicts and enhance mutual understanding. This book will be of interest to scholars, diplomats, and China watchers. Jarmila Pt\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 graduated from the Humboldt University in Berlin, specializing in Chinese and Central Asian Studies. She obtained her Ph.D. in Tibetan Studies from the same institution. Currently, she is affiliated with the Oriental Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague.

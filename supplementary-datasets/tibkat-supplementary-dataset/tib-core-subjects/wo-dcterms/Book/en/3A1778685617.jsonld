            "abstract": "The all-encompassing term Space Science was coined to describe all of the various fields of research in science: Physics and astronomy, aerospace engineering and spacecraft technologies, advanced computing and radio communication systems, that are concerned with the study of the Universe, and generally means either excluding the Earth or outside of the Earth's atmosphere. This special volume on Space Science was built throughout a scientifically rigorous selection process of each contributed chapter. Its structure drives the reader into a fascinating journey starting from the surface of our planet to reach a boundary where something lurks at the edge of the observable, light-emitting Universe, presenting four Sections running over a timely review on space exploration and the role being played by newcomer nations, an overview on Earth's early evolution during its long ancient ice age, a reanalysis of some aspects of satellites and planetary dynamics, to end up with intriguing discussions on recent advances in physics of cosmic microwave background radiation and cosmology",

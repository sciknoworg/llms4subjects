            "abstract": "Sleep is undoubtedly one of the most intricate and abstruse issues in humans. Disturbances of sleep are widespread and can have a great impact on involved individuals as well as an economic influence on society. The COVID-19 pandemic forced predominant changes in recent years, such as the development of wearable devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) in telehealth. These are helpful for disease evaluation and treatment, however, they may not be adequate for dealing with the complexity of sleep medicine. I believe that specialists in sleep medicine will accelerate increased public awareness of sleep disorders and facilitate the consolidation of sleep health into medical care in a responsible fashion, including innovations in sleep medicine. This book presents updated developments as well as future perspectives in sleep medicine. It is a useful resource for persons involved in sleep medicine, whether they are clinicians, researchers, or patients",

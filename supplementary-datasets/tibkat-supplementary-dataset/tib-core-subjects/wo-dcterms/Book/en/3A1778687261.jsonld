            "abstract": "This book points to some new areas for investigation on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Firstly, the features and management of some specific SCC is discussed to give the readers the general principles in dealing with these uncommon and sophisticated conditions. Some new concepts in adjuvant therapy including neoadjuvant therapy and gold nanoparticle-based photo dynamic therapy are introduced. Secondly, a detailed discussion of molecular aspects of tumor invasion and progression in SCC is provided with the emphasis on the roles of some important factors. The role of tumor microenvironment in head and neck SCC is specifically discussed. Thirdly, the roles of cancer stem cells (CSC) in cancer therapy of SCC are described. Molecular mechanisms involving therapeutic resistance and new therapeutic strategies targeting CSC are discussed in detail. Finally, other aspects concerning SCC are included, which involve the assessment, genetic manipulation and its possible clinical implications for the treatment of SCC",

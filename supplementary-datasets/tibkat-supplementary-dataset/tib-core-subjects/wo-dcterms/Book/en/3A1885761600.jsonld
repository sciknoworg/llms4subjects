            "abstract": "Building Information Modeling (BIM) is changing the way architects and engineers produce and deliver design results, and object-oriented 3D models are now starting to replace traditional 2D drawings during the construction phase. This allows for a number of applications to increase efficiency, such as quantity take-off, cost-estimation, and planning, but it also supports better communication and increased understanding at the construction site by means of detailed 3D models together with various visualization techniques. However, even in projects with a fully BIM-based design, there is one remaining part that is still done primarily using 2D drawings and sketches \u2013 the construction site layout plan. In addition to not take advantage of the benefits offered by 3D, it also makes it difficult to integrate site layout planning within the openBIM ecosystem. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a user-friendly, IFC-compatible software system that supports collaborative, multi-user creation of construction site layout plans using both multi-touch table and immersive VR. By allowing temporary structures, machines, and other components to be easily added and updated it is possible to continuously produce and communicate 3D site layout plans that are aligned with the schedule and supports integration with other BIM-tools",

                "\"The first volume \"Human performance in automated and autonomous systems: Current Theory and Methods\" examines the advances in theories, methods, and models relevant to automated and autonomous systems. Such texts are rocks in the river of progress. They freeze, at one moment in time, what we think we know. The present text allows us explicitly to look back to ask questions about what we did know, and what we aspired to know at that time. Like the prognostications of visionaries such as Bartlett, that exercise then allows us a 180 degree turn in order to now look into our present's own future. Its contents highlight the significance of presently emerging technologies that determine the course of our daily lives. This book also depicts the boundaries that separate humans from machine as we continue to become ever more immersed in and symbiotic with these fast-emerging technologies. In this context, we recognize the need for human-centered approaches to design; a carefully crafted automated technology that places the \"human user\" in the center of that design process. To this end, this volume applies scientific theory directly to real world applications where automated technology is now being implemented. This book highlights human factors and engineering issues across real-world applications, concerning emerging issues and practical perspectives on human performance in automated and autonomous systems. It covers cross-domain principles and implementation. It also shows how context drives automation and autonomy decisions in both design and operations\"--"

            "abstract": "Title in English: Metamorphoses of the Brno Organ Festival. The presented publication brings knowledge about the cultural-historical development of the festival, dramaturgical concept, choice of artists, the character of concert instruments, etc.  The first chapter contains a cross-section of the 40-year history of the festival (Judita Ku\u010derov\u00e1). The historical study is followed by 3 chapters, first including the personal memories and experiences of the contemporary dramaturg and festival organizer Hana Barto\u0161ov\u00e1. The essay on the organist's mission as a concert artist was contributed by the founder of the organ festival, prof. Alena Vesel\u00e1, former rector of the Jan\u00e1\u010dek Academy of Performing Arts in Brno and still active concert organist. The chapter on the concert organs, which the individual music evenings are played, was prepared by P. Jan Martin Bej\u010dek, OSB. The last part of the collective monograph consists of overviews of concerts held since the first years of the festival (Hana Barto\u0161ov\u00e1), then in the period when the artistic and financial patronage of the Brno Organ Festival was taken over by the Club of Moravian Composers (Marek Sedl\u00e1\u010dek) and an overview of non-Brno concerts (Hana Barto\u0161ov\u00e1). The text has a source nature, the authors draw on preserved written documents and interviews with witnesses and festival organizers",

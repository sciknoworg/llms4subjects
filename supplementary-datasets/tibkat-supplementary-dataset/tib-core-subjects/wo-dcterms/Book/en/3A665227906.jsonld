            "abstract": "This thirtieth volume in Erasmus' Opera omnia (ASD) is the fourth volumewithin 'ordo' IX, that is the 'ordo' of the Apologies. The division into 'ordines' each'ordo' being devoted to a specific literary or thematic category - was laiddown by Erasmus himself for the posthumous publication of his works (seeGeneral introduction, ASD I, pp. x, xvii-xviii, and C. Reedijk, Tandem bona causatriumphat. Zur Geschichte des Gesamtwerkes des Erasmus von Rotterdam. Vortrageder Aeneas-Silvius-Stiftung an der Universita.t Basel, XVI, Basel/Stuttgart, 1980,p. 12 sqq., 21-22).The present volume (tom. IX, 4) contains Apologia qua respondet duabus inuectiuisEduardi Lei; Responsio ad annotationes Eduardi Lei; Manifesta Mendacia (ed.Erika Rummel, Toronto), and Responsio ad disputationem cuiusdam Phimostomide diuortio (ed. Edwin Rabbie, The Hague).The Editorial Board and the editors of the present volume are grateful to alllibraries that kindly put books, photostats, microfilms, and bibliographicalmaterial at their disposal.On 6 May, 2002, Professor Sem Dresden, President of the Conseil internationalpour l'edition des reuvres completes d'Erasme from 1971-1998, died at Leiden atthe age of 87. This Presidency was but one of the many official duties he carriedout with such distinction. He served as rector magnificus of Leiden University, asPresident of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and as chairmanof many other societies and committees. His style of presiding was casualand ironical, but always very effective.Although much sought-after as chairman of various bodies in the scholarlyworld, his real love was for literature and art. He started his academic career atLeiden University as professor of French literature (1947-1975), after which heswitched to general literature (1975-1981). His publications mirror his versatilemind: he wrote about Erasmus, Rabelais, Grotius, Proust, Valery and manyothers; he discussed, among other things, kitsch, the detective novel and theVIII PREFACEpleasure of reading; he devoted books to the theory of biography, humanism,creativity, symbolism, and Holocaust literature. One of Dresden's favouriteauthors was Montaigne whom he characterised as the 'spelende wijsgeer' (theplaying philosopher). In April 2002 he was awarded the EC. Hooft prize, theDutch national prize for literature, for his books and essays.Professor Dresden joined the Conseil international in 1965 and has also been amember of the Editorial Board. In 1977 he edited Erasmus' De contemptu mundi(ASD V, I, pp. 1-86) and in 1985 the Commentaries on Psalms 2 and 3 (ASD V, 2,pp. 81-179).We will cherish the memory or our former President for his many contributionsto the Erasmus edition. His devotion to ASD and its collaboratorswas, as we remember, often hidden behind what he himself used to call hislightheartedness",

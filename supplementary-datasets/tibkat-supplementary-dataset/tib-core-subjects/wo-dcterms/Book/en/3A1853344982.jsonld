            "abstract": "This book examines individuals, families and communities of craftworkers and their changing experience in town and country. Based on case studies drawn from personal, business, institutional and official records, as well as newspaper reports and visual illustrations, it looks at workplace dynamics and handmade wares shaped by personal consumption, rather than industrial production. Stana Nenadic examines the \u2018things\u2019 that were made and the values they embodied at a time when most Scots were still engaged in hand making \u2013 either for income or pleasure \u2013 despite Scotland\u2019s emergence as a great industrial powerhouse",

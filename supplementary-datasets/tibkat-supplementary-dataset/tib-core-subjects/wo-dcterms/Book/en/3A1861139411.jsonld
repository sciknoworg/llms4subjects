                "Chapter 1: Understanding the Customer Needs -- Chapter 2: Security Model -- Chapter 3: Organizational Model -- Chapter 4: Data Lake Structure -- Chapter 5: Production Playground -- Chapter 6: Production Operationalization -- Chapter 7: Miscellaneous.",
                "This book explains how to implement a data lake strategy, covering the technical and business challenges architects commonly face. It also illustrates how and why client requirements should drive architectural decisions. Drawing upon a specific case from his own experience, author Nayanjyoti Paul begins with the consideration from which all subsequent decisions should flow: what does your customer need? He also describes the importance of identifying key stakeholders and the key points to focus on when starting a new project. Next, he takes you through the business and technical requirement-gathering process, and how to translate customer expectations into tangible technical goals. From there, you\u2019ll gain insight into the security model that will allow you to establish security and legal guardrails, as well as different aspects of security from the end user\u2019s perspective. You\u2019ll learn which organizational roles need to be onboarded into the data lake, their responsibilities, the services they need access to, and how the hierarchy of escalations should work. Subsequent chapters explore how to divide your data lakes into zones, organize data for security and access, manage data sensitivity, and techniques used for data obfuscation. Audit and logging capabilities in the data lake are also covered before a deep dive into designing data lakes to handle multiple kinds and file formats and access patterns. The book concludes by focusing on production operationalization and solutions to implement a production setup. After completing this book, you will understand how to implement a data lake, the best practices to employ while doing so, and will be armed with practical tips to solve business problems. You will: Understand the challenges associated with implementing a data lake Explore the architectural patterns and processes used to design a new data lake Design and implement data lake capabilities Associate business requirements with technical deliverables to drive success."

            "abstract": "\"This volume, Nanomaterials Based Composites for Energy Applications: Emerging Technology and Trends, covers the importance of nanomaterials based composites for renewable and alternative energy applications. Taking a multidisciplinary approach, it looks at using composites without losing the extraordinary strength of the nanomaterials, preparing new composites with high dielectric permittivity, improving load-carrying capacity, and more. Simulation and experimental work is included, providing a current view of the research that is going on in laboratories all over the world. Readers will find different procedures to prepare materials for making composites for applications in the energy sector. Specific topics in the volume include: functional and smart materials for energy applications nanocomposite materials and methods of preparation thin film technology magnetic fluid related to energy harvesting and storage semiconductor photocatalytic nanomaterials with the novel structural and electronic properties for solar energy application the application of nanomaterials and nanoengineering in the aviation industry, with the aim to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions associated with air freight and air travel more The book will be a rich reference for professors and instructors, professionals, researchers, and engineering students interested in applying the emerging field of nanoscience and nanotechnology to energy applications\"--",

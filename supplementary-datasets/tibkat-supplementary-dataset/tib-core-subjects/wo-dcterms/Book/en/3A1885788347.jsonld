            "abstract": "The inspiration for this book was a Summer School on State, Governance and Development presented by distinguished academics from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. Written by young African scholars, the chapters here focus on state, governance and development in Africa as seen from the authors\u2019 vantage points and positions in different sectors of society. The book opens with three forewords by eminent African scholars \u2013 Ben Turok, Johan Burger and Mohamed Halfani. The chapters that follow examine rent-seeking, patronage, neopatrimonialism and bad governance. They engage with statehood, state-building and statecraft and challenge the mainstream opinions of donors, funders, development banks, international non-governmental organisations and development organisations. They include the role of China in Africa, Kenya\u2019s changing demographics, state accountability in South Africa\u2019s dominant party system, Somalia\u2019s prospects for state-building, urban development and routine violence, and resource mobilisation. At a time in which core institutions are being tested \u2013 the market, the rule of law, democracy, civil society and representative democracy \u2013 this book offers a much-needed multi- and inter-disciplinary perspective, and a different narrative on what is unfolding, while also exposing dynamics that are often overlooked",

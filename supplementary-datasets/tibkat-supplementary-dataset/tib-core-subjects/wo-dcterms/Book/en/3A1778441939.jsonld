            "abstract": "This book presents new studies in the area of turbomachine mathematical modeling with a focus on models applied to developing engine control and diagnostic systems. The book contains one introductory and four main chapters. The introductory chapter describes the area of modeling of gas and wind turbines and shows the demand for further improvement of the models. The first three main chapters offer particular improvements in gas turbine modeling. First, a novel methodology for the modeling of engine starting is presented. Second, a thorough theoretical comparative analysis is performed for the models of engine internal gas capacities, and practical recommendations are given on model applications, in particular for engine control purposes. Third, multiple algorithms for calculating important unmeasured parameters for engine diagnostics are proposed and compared. It is proven that the best algorithms allow accurate prognosis of engine remaining lifetime.The field of wind turbine modeling is presented in the last main chapter. It introduces a general-purpose model that describes both aerodynamic and electric parts of a wind power plant. Such a detailed physics-based model will help with the development of more accurate control and diagnostic systems.In this way, this book includes four new studies in the area of gas and wind turbine modeling. These studies will be interesting and useful for specialists in turbine engine control and diagnostics",

                "\u201cThe book gives an excellent understanding of a reimagination and recreation of leadership and organisational theory. Jevnaker and Olaisen present new perspectives and represent a new school of modernity and futurism.\u201d - Professor Jon-Arild Johannessen, Kristiania University College and Nord University \u201cSustainable organizations are becoming imperative in contemporary business, and I highly recommend this book to any reader interested in understanding the fundamental dynamics.\u201d - Professor Georg von Krogh, ETH Zurich This open access book reimagines a deeper sustainability in dynamic organization. Offering multiple perspectives on arts, design thinking, leadership, knowledge and project management, Reimagining Sustainable Organization addresses our need for thinking and coping differently when facing the many unknowns of real-life enterprises in society. Drawing on process philosophy, real-world case studies, and examinations of business practices as well as management research, the authors explore knowledge creation towards reimagining sustainable organization. The book includes frameworks and conceptual tools as well as insights for further explorations. This book will be of interests to students, scholars and teachers, and practitioners who are studying sustainable organization, greener management, leadership ideas, or knowledge and project management. It covers future pressing issues also for the professionals involved in co-creative work across organizational boundaries.

            "abstract": "The world of comic strips always reflected the fashion of the time? from R.F. Outcault's nightie-clad 'Yellow Kid' to Grace Drayton's 'Campbell Kids'. By the 1920s all the little roly-poly girls depicted in those early strips had grown up, bobbed their curls, and become flappers. Women got the vote in 1920, and suddenly they were equal to the boys? at least in the voting booth. They smoked and drank bootleg hootch, they shortened their hair and skirts, and tossed out their corsets. It was a revolution, a time of excess and ebullience, and the flapper was the new queen? and scores of women cartoonists chronicled her in the pages of America's newspapers.0Fantagraphics celebrates that revolution with 'The Flapper Queens', a gorgeous oversized hardcover collection of full-color comic strips. In addition to featuring the more well-known cartoonists of the era, such as Ethel Hays and Nell Brinkley, Eisner-winning comics herstorian Robbins introduces you to women cartoonists like Eleanor Schorer, who started her career in the teens as a flowery art nouveau Nell Brinkley imitator, but by the '20s was drawing bold and outrageous art deco illustrations; Edith Stevens, who chronicled the fashion trends, hairstyles, and social manners of the '20s and '30s in the pages of The Boston Globe; and Virginia Huget, possibly the flappiest of the Flapper Queens, whose girls, with their angular elbows and knees, seemed to always exist in a euphoric state of Charleston. Trina Robbins welcomes you to the revolution with a coffee table book filled with liberating, full-color illustrations and comic strips",

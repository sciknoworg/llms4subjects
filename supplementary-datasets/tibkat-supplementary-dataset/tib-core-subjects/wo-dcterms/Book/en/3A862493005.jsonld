                "\"We are living in an age of continual motion and change, and as a result traditional strategy planning has become outmoded. Every manager, perhaps even every employee, needs to become a strategist. Every strategist, in turn, needs to develop deep consumer insight - or empathy - as a basis for flexible strategy formation. This book offers a practical guide on how to develop and implement a systematic process of strategic empathy to lead to greater effectiveness and day-to-day success. Marketing With Strategic Empathy is written by Claire Brooks, the CEO of the global consulting firm where the strategic empathy framework and processes were developed. She has applied these in many successful projects for international corporations for more than 10 years\"--",

                "\"The current focus in many Fortune 500 companies is on consumer insights, where strategists develop deep consumer insight - or empathy--as a basis for flexible strategy formation. Strategic Empathy, therefore, is not a soft skill, but can be a powerful force for success.  At the core of the Strategic Empathy process is immersive and experiential learning, also known as Strategic Learning, leading to a deep understanding about the functional, emotional, and cultural drivers behind consumers' thoughts, feelings, and actions. Marketing With Strategic Empathy explains how to: -design and implement Strategic Learning Journeys -implement specific learning methods, including techniques to uncover unconscious emotions, ethnographic observation, online research, semiotic analysis, and trends analysis -empower managers with team-based skills for activating learning -develop video and multimedia story telling skills for communicating StrategicLearning and other strategies to stakeholders  The book also provides proven skills, processes, leadership methods, how-to guidance, and global case studies to help companies implement Strategic Empathy within their organization\"--"

            "abstract": "In 1962, Louis I. Kahn described the design of the Salk Institute as having been developed \u201cout of a respect and understanding of the nature of nature,\u201d before adding: \u201cI am becoming increasingly conscious of the architecture of water, the architecture of air, the architecture of light.\u201d Attempting to poetically unveil the world through the conscious architectonization of nature, the deliberations presented in this book interpret the American architect\u2019s buildings as the result of a Stoic pursuit to comprehend the lawfulness of the natural world, scrutinize his endeavor to set spatial compositions into analogy with organisms\u2019 principles of growth and form, illustrate his growing awareness to shape space in reciprocity with environmental forces, and acknowledge his eventual willingness to make the surrounding landscape and cosmos an integrated part of the architectural project. Furthermore, Kahn\u2019s highly ambiguous epistemology with regard to man\u2019s position within and beyond nature is being discussed \u2013 ultimately promoting an ecologically sound down to earth approach, which takes into account the impulse of the primitive and elemental. Aspiring for an eternal expression, the manifestation of the world of the human spirit was for Kahn \u2013 one of the most legendary and original architects of the 20th century \u2013 only possible within the larger order of the universe, whereas the same transcendent, creative joy pervaded both",

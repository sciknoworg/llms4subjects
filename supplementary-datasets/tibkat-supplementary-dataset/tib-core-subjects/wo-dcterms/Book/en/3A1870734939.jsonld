                "\u201cThis is an essential volume for scholars and practitioners interested in open government. It includes an unprecedented range of case studies from across Asia and the Middle East. This book reminds us why open government is so important at a time when transparency and democracy are under pressure around the world.\u201d \u2014Alasdair Roberts, Professor of Public Policy, University of Massachusetts, USA \u201cOpen Government and the associated requirement of freedom of information are inextricably linked to good governance. This collection of country case studies spanning those which embrace open government to those with much to learn, offers a fascinating tour de force of Asian countries from diverse historical, political, and cultural backgrounds.\u201d \u2014Colin Knox, Professor of Public Policy, Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan; Emeritus Professor, Ulster University, UK The book examines the state of Open Government in Asia. Drawing on thirteen country case studies and one regional study, it analyses the application of Freedom of Information methods and assesses their implications for democratic governance, particularly transparency, accountability, participation, collaboration, inclusive policymaking and technology. The book also considers the usefulness of open participatory platforms that enable citizens\u2019 \u2018right to information\u2019, and help them monitor and scrutinize governmental activities to ensure accountability, integrity and the quality of democracy.

            "abstract": "Samogitian Calvary Hills is the Way of the Cross made of 20 sites, 19 stations in 19 chapels in the premises of \u017demai\u010di\u0173 Kalvarija town. \u201cSamogitian Calvary Hills\u201d is also the title used for a prayer book dedicated to walking the stations. This prayer book is used in Samogitia during the Good Friday and Saturday in churches and during funeral and commemoration of the deceased at home. \u201cHills\u201d is a term used by Lithuanian Catholic Church clergy and editors of Samogitian folklore and religious books describing religious practice; it has derived from the title of the first edi\u00action prayer book published by Dominican monk Jurgis Kasakauskis in 1681. Afterwards \u201cHills\u201d prayers and hymns were included in later prayer books. This continued until the declaration of the provisions of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). After the declaration of the provisions of the Second Vatican Council started printing a new versions of \u201cHills\u201d prayers and hymns. This fact allowed noticing the problematic in change and expression of literal and musical texts of prayers and hymns in Hills prayer books. The problematic allowed formulating the research object \u2013 prayers, hymns, music and rites of \u201cHills\u201d prayer books. Research goal \u2013 to analyse literary and musical texts of prayers and hymns in \u201cHills\u201d prayer books and the origins of their music and rites, historiographic development and reasons for variations. The research validated the hypothesis that prayers, hymns and their mu\u00acsic in the \u201cold\u201d \u201cHills\u201d prayer book are not created (except for intentions of stations and prayer \u201cLet us pray\u201d and hymns \u201cGracious Queen\u201d [\u201cKaralien\u0117 maloninga\u201d \u2013 in Lithuania and \u201cThe most sacred Mother of Heavenly King\u201d [\u201cDangaus Karaliaus Motina \u0161ven\u010diausia\u201d \u2013 in Lithuania]) as it is stated, but composed and prepared prayer book on the initiative of Jesuit, Franciscan and Dominican monks based on calls, acclamations and hymns dedicated to the commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ in polish prayer books and hymnals during the time of counter reformation. It was newly edited and recreated by local priests and monks based on the documents of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965)",

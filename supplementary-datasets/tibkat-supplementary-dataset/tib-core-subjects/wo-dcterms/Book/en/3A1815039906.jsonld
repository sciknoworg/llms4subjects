            "abstract": "\"This new volume aims to be the single book that discusses in a comprehensive and elaborate way the photosynthetic and respiratory mechanisms in plants under hostile situations and the proper mitigating strategies to continue uninterrupted photosynthesis and respiration under such situations. Since photosynthesis and respiration are the two main physiological processes for sugar biosynthesis and mobilization for driving all other vital functions, this volume delivers a wealth of sound knowledge in the related disciplines for the scientists, researchers, and academicians. With chapters from renowned scientists, researchers, and global leaders in this field, this volume focuses on the effect of environmental stressors on photosynthetic pigments, photosystems, activities of photosynthetic enzymes and protein complexes, PSII photochemistry, carbon fixation pathways, photosynthetic efficiency, glycolytic and Krebs cycle pathways, and ATP production and electron transport chain of plants. The recovery of photosynthesis and respiration through application of phytohormones, signaling molecules, and other protective agents is also emphasized. Genetic engineering to enhance photosynthetic efficiency has also been highlighted. This valuable book, Photosynthesis and Respiratory Cycles during Environmental Stress Response in Plants, will not only enable us to understand the nature of extensive damages brought to the photosynthetic and respiratory processes but will also provide a blueprint for devising proper mitigation strategies to sustain these two vital processes under challenging environmental conditions\"--",

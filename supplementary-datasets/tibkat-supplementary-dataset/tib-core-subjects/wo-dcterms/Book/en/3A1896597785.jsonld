                "This second edition volume expands on the previous edition with new and updated chapters that explore our current view on plastid evolution, structure, and function. The chapters in this book are organized into three parts and cover topics such as plastid evolution, plasticity, and functional and structural diversity; techniques used to visualize, fractionate, purify, and study primary plastids from plant materials, and secondary plastids; and methods to analyze plastids by integrated biology strategies based on genetics, genomics, proteomics, and lipidomics. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Cutting-edge and authoritative, Plastids: Methods and Protocols, Second Edition is a valuable resource that will help students, engineers, and researchers further explore and understand this fascinating organelle. ."

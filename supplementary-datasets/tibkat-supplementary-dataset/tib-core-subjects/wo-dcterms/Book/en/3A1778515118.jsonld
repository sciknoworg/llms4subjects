            "abstract": "This research explores different probability models of labor demand induced by the innovative behavior of Pe-ruvian enterprises in two levels, national average and of three particular industries: cultural and creative indus-tries, Knowledge Intensive Business Services (kibs), and high- and medium-high technology (hmht). Internation-al evidence suggests that such activities have the power to generate new knowledge which once disseminated can, at the same time, influence the innovative behavior of other sectors. The independent variables are grouped into internal and external determinants to the compa-ny, which act on it through knowledge spillovers. It was found that, for an average company that introduced one of the three types of innovation analyzed and that hired personnel as a result of these introductions, the largest important number of knowledge spillovers comes re-spectively from the kibs, creative and cultural industries and hmht. However, it is also observed that the magni-tude of knowledge spillovers from innovative companies in creative and cultural industries over kibs is greater than that observed in the other way round, that is, kibswould benefit more from creative and cultural indus-tries as external source of knowledge that vice versa. Therefore, to sum up, creative and cultural industries are important to promote innovation in the economy as a whole",

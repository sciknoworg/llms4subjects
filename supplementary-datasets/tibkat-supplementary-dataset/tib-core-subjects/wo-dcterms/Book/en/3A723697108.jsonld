            "abstract": "This report is based on four main sources: an extensive literature review, the analysis of theanswers to a questionnaire sent to FATF and FSRB members; the results of a typology workshop andsubsequent consultation with the football sector. Results to the questionnaire were obtained in October 2008 from 25 countries, mostly European,seven South-American countries, two from Asia and Australia. The responding countries differ widely insize, role and organisation of football in society (ranging from large countries with big football leagues tosmaller nations or nations with only non-professional football). Differences in information, position andinterest in the person or organisation that provided the answers (national football association, governmentrepresentatives, national FIUs, the police or judicial authorities) needed to be taken into consideration aswell.Following the analysis of questionnaires, a workshop on money laundering and the footballsector was held in Monaco in November 2008 as part of the 2008 FATF/MONEYVAL Typologiesmeeting. This workshop was very well supported by members of the FATF, MONEYVAL andrepresentatives of other countries. The following participants were involved in the 2-day breakout sessionwhich considered issues in depth: Belgium, Brazil, Cyprus, Egmont Group, France, International OlympicCommittee (IOC), Ireland, Italy, Monaco, Norway, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, theNetherlands and the United Kingdom.The study has also relied on the experience and cooperation of the private sector. Arepresentative of the IOC attended the Monaco workshop in November 2008. Consultation withrepresentatives of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and of the Union ofEuropean Football Associations (UEFA) also took place in January and April 2009. Those representativesreceived a copy of the report and were given the opportunity to comment. All the comments of the private sector were taken into account when considered relevant.",

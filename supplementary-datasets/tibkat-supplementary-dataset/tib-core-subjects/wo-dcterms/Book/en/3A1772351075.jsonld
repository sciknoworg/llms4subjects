            "abstract": "\"Today, pollution due to various anthropogenic activities has increased many times. Organic and inorganic pollutants are the most significant problem that humanity currently faces in the broad categories of water pollutants. Although several measures have been proposed and implemented to reduce these pollutants, their increasing concentration in bodies of water has created serious concerns. Over the years, the problem has been aggravated by uncontrolled industrialization and urbanization and the consequent alteration of humanity's natural resources. The direct discharge of wastewater contaminants and their geographical mobilization have led to increased concentrations in ground, surface, and residual waters. Therefore, it is essential to understand this problem today and to control the source. In addition, extensive knowledge of detection and disposal methods is needed to develop technological solutions for various environments, including urban, rural, and urban areas. The purpose of this book is to provide an information platform about wastewater contaminants in the current context, where researchers, engineers, and technologists working in this field face various challenges. Conventional physicochemical techniques used to remove contaminants from wastewater include ion exchange, precipitation, degradation, coagulation, coating, membrane processes, and adsorption. However, these applications have technological and economic limitations. Biomass-related precursors for the preparation of biosorbents are attracting increasing attention from researchers. Different activation approaches are used in addition to native biomass utilizations. This book deliberately minimizes basic information and focuses on sources of water pollution, biomass for biosorbent preparation, characterization of biosorbents, understanding associated biosorption mechanisms, modeling analyses of biosorption, sustainable approaches for biosorption applications, and possibilities for recovering precious metals. This book will be a key guide for environmental engineers, researchers, water authorities, and students in these fields\"--",

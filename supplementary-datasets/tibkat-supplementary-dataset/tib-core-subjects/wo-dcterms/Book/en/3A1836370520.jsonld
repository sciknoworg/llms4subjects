            "abstract": "\u201cEvery written work,\u201d Giorgio Agamben opens the preface to Infancy and History, \u201ccan be regarded as the prologue (or rather, the broken cast) of a work never penned, and destined to remain so.\u201d Although that observation applies to any work of writing, the exemplary case is that of a work of philosophy. While every written work is put to work in its nonexistent successor, a work of philosophy is bereft of even that recourse: philosophy is written in the breakdown of destiny, so that every work of philosophy must first and foremost confront the absolute abandonment of its writing. At work in each and every work of philosophy is the question, \u201cWhat is a work of philosophy?\u201d More concretely, although well-formed and rigorously structured, What is Philosophy? abstains from work. On even a quick reading that fact must be palpable. A seminar paper? An article, or book chapter? Not in the least. Nor, essentially, may the individual pieces that compose it be so developed. Fragments unrecognizable as at one time a cast, inconceivable at a future time as anything else, the position of each piece with respect to the others thwarts development in order to preserve, in its place, the tension of its absence. As such, the articulations internal to each of the three divisions, and between them, are essential. The first division \u2014 What is Philosophy? \u2014 takes seriously Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s contention in their book of the same title that \u201cThe nonphilosophical is perhaps closer to the heart of philosophy than philosophy itself, and this means that philosophy cannot be content to be understood only philosophically or conceptually, but is essentially addressed to nonphilosophers as well\u201d \u2014 including the nonphilosopher in every philosopher. The second division \u2014 On Argument \u2014 interrogates the status and value of evidence, and self-evidence. The third division \u2014 On Not Knowing \u2014 generalizes a parenthetical observation of Agamben\u2019s on Heidegger, \u201cIf we may attempt to identify something like the characteristic Stimmung of every thinker, perhaps it is precisely this being delivered over to something that refuses itself that defines the specific emotional tonality of Heidegger\u2019s thought\u201d: Might not philosophy be defined, the phil of sophia, precisely, as what it is to be delivered over to something that refuses itself?",

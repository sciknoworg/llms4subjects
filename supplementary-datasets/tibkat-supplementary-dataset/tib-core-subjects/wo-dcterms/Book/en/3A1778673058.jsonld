            "abstract": "In 1994, after following a character in Peter Handke\u2019s novel Repetition into what is now Slovenia and after traveling in landscapes of Handke\u2019s youth, \u017darko Radakovi\u0107 and Scott Abbott published a two-headed text in Belgrade, Ponavljane, now published in English by punctum as Repetitions. The possibility of narration in two voices, complicated by the third voice that is Peter Handke\u2019s own narrator, is the main focus of deliberation while traveling and reading and writing. Repetitions begins with Abbott\u2019s text, a fairly straightforward travel narrative. It ends with Radakovi\u0107\u2019s account of the same events, much less straightforward, more repetitious, more adventuresome. Two aspects make the double-book unique. First, it represents experiences shared by two authors whose native languages are Serbian and English respectively (German is their only common language). The authors\u2019 perspectives contrast with and supplement one another: Radakovi\u0107 grew up in Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia and Abbott comes from the Mormon American West; Radakovi\u0107 is the translator of most of Peter Handke\u2019s works into Serbo-Croatian and Abbott translated Handke\u2019s provocative A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia for Viking Press and his play Voyage by Dugout: The Play of the Film of the War for PAJ (Performing Arts Journal); Radakovi\u0107 was a journalist for Deutsche Welle in Cologne and Abbott is a professor of German literature at Utah Valley University; Radakovi\u0107 is the author of several novels and Abbott has published mostly literary-critical work; and so on. Two sets of eyes. Two pens. Two visions of the world",

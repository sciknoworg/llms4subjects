            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Analytical chemists in industry are frequently faced with situations where a basic understanding of microbiology would be an advantage, for instance in the analysis of bacteria in food. Microbiology for the Analytical Chemist has been written specifically for analytical chemists who have little or no knowledge of microbiology, but might be required to interpret microbiological results. This book covers a wide range of microbiological situations in analysis. It deals with the question of establishing when a sample is contaminated, the problems of counting and identifying micro-organisms and establishing what effect they will have on the sample. The book examines the microbial contents of water and food. It also looks at the procedures for disinfecting and preservative testing. Traditional laboratory methods are discussed, and new rapid techniques are also considered. Microbiology for the Analytical Chemist is unusual in that it pulls together those aspects of microbiology which are of interest to analytical chemists and explains them at a basic level using practical situations as examples.  This book will also be of interest to analytical chemists in academic or industrial laboratories, where there is no fund of microbiological experience to draw on",

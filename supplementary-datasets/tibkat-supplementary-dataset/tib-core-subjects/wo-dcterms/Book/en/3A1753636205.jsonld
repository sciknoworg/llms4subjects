            "abstract": "This brief presents findings from the third round of the Uganda High-Frequency Phone Survey on COVID-19 (UHFPS), which was conducted in September-October 2020. In June 2020, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), with the support from the World Bank, officially launched the HFPS to track the impacts of the pandemic on a monthly basis for a period of 12 months. The survey aimed to recontact the entire sample of households that had been interviewed during the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS) 2019/20 round and that had phone numbers for at least one household member or a reference individual. The first round (baseline) of the survey was conducted from June 3rd to June 20th, the second round was conducted between July 31 and August 21 and the third round was conducted from September 14th to October 7th, 2020. Of the 2,421 households targeted 2,227 households were interviewed in round 1, and 2,199 among them were interviewed in round 2, and finally 2,147 households were interviewed in round 3 representing a 99 percent response rate between rounds 2 and 3",

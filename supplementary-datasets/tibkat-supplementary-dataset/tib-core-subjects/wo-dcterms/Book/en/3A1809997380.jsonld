            "abstract": "\"The intention of the authors is to present the fundamentals of green urban stormwater infrastructure from an engineering design and performance analysis perspective. This book is intended to be used as a textbook in senior-undergraduate and first-year graduate courses in water resources/environmental engineering. It is also envisioned to be a reference for practicing engineers and other water/environment professionals. The book focuses on novel stormwater control measures (SCMs) and related technologies for the reductions of detrimental impacts from urban stormwater. Stormwater challenges have risen in importance as clean water focus has shifted from point to nonpoint source pollution as a source of water impairments. Stormwater also becomes part of the \"one water\" focus on long-term sustainable urban water. Many novel SCMs are nature-based and are considered as part of a \"green infrastructure\" approach that includes bioretention, vegetated swales, vegetated filter strips, green roofs, pervious pavements, water harvesting, and wetlands. It is expected that users of this book would have had a course in engineering hydraulics/ hydrology and some exposure to environmental engineering treatment processes and water quality. It is also complementary to graduate surface water hydrology and traditional water and wastewater treatment engineering. While written with an engineering focus, nonengineers such as landscape architects, planners, and environmental scientists should find the text useful. Specific attempts have been made to integrate both English (US customary) and metric units throughout the book. The initial chapters provide background information on urban hydrology, water quality, and stormwater generation and characteristics. The preponderance of the book focuses on stormwater control and improvement via a suite of different green infrastructure technologies and techniques. Within this context, background information on engineering unit processes for affecting the water balance and improving water quality are presented. The evolving challenge of setting and meeting stormwater control metrics is discussed. The latter chapters provide specific details on categories of SCMs; topics such as selection, design, performance, and maintenance are presented in detail. SCM selection, treatment trains, and climate change are included as a final chapter. This text provides a baseline as this topic is a rapidly changing field\"--",

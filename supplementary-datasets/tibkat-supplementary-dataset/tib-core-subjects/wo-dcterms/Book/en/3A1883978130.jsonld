            "abstract": "The aim of this report is to gather evidence that will identify priorities and actions by stakeholders towards positively influencing, up scaling and accelerating gender equality and women's empowerment in Zimbabwe. The report consolidates information on gender gaps and drivers of inequality in human endowments, economic opportunities, ownership and control of assets, and voice and agency. This includes identifying factors that deepen inequalities, and effectiveness of current policies and programming in narrowing gender disparities. The aim is to also identify promising and good practices that can potentially be replicated for greater impact, cascading to all areas in the country. The analysis guided by a conceptual framework that describes the ways households, markets, and institutions (both formal and informal), and their interactions all influence gender equality and economic development outcomes. Additionally, attention is paid to intersecting identities of women and men that affect their ability to access services and opportunities, including disability status, place of residence and other socio cultural and economic factors. The assessment draws on several data sources collected using mixed methods. Available quantitative and qualitative data sources form the basis of the assessment, including surveys, national and institutional reports and broader feminist and economic literature. Robust stakeholder consultations, including representatives from Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ), development partners, the United Nations (UN), Non- Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and communities grounded the analysis and provided insights into priority setting and forward-looking strategies",

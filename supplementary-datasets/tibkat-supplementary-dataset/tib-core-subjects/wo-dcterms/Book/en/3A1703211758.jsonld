In this book Groves has for the first time revealed some characteristic strands of Arthur Purnell\u2019s talents, whereby his subject\u2019s remarkable creativity is now clear for us to enjoy.\u201d - Robert Irving, architecture historian and pupil of Arthur Purnell Arthur Purnell\u2019s \u2018Forgotten\u2019 Architecture: Canton and Cars focuses on two early phases in the career of the much overlooked and underrated Australian architect, Arthur Purnell (1878\u20131964). In 1903, Purnell teamed up with the American engineer, Charles Paget (1874\u20131933) in Canton, China. Between 1903 and 1910, Purnell and Paget designed many important and impressive buildings, including the Arnhold, Karberg & Co. building (1907), one of the first reinforced concrete buildings in Southern China, and the South China Cement Factory (1907), which would later become the headquarters of Dr. Sun Yatsen (1866\u20131925), the first president of the Republic of China. Not many architects can design a cement factory fit for a president\u2019s palace! When Purnell returned to Australia in 1910, he had to start again from scratch. As cars were taking over from horses in a big way, he saw that designing for cars would be the next big thing in architecture. The fledgling Australian car industry was full of colourful, larger-than-life characters like Col. Harley Tarrant (1860\u20131949), who built his first car in 1897 and Australia\u2019s first petrol-fuelled car in 1901, and Alec Barlow Sr. (1880\u20131937), the archetypal dodgy car salesman. Purnell wanted in, designing many buildings for both men, including early car factories and car showrooms. In this unique book, Groves asks: why isn\u2019t Arthur Purnell more famous?",

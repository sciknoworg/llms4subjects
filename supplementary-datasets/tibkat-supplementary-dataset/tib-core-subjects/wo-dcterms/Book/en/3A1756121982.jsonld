            "abstract": "75 years after the liberation of the Netherlands, a new museum will open its doors on the former site of Camp Amersfoort. During the Second World War, 45,000 prisoners were interned at this transit and penal camp. The new building will provide insights into the history of the camp, and will help to keep the memory of this place alive.0National Monument Camp Amersfoort is a place of ?memory and reflection?. To consider, to remember and, above all, to look forward: What is the reality of what happened here and what lessons can be drawn from this? The significance of a place builds upon commemoration as a design theme, influencing the development of both the new museum and the old memorial centre. By highlighting the relationship between its history and the traces it has left in the landscape, the story of Camp Amersfoort can be revealed.0The architect, the landscape architect and the experience designers provide an insight into their multidisciplinary approach. How did such a design come about? What were the guiding principles? What problems did they face in realizing such a complex assignment at this exceptional site?0Jacques Prins is an architect and partner at Inbo. Max Meijer is a heritage advisor for TiMe Amsterdam. Floris van Dijk is a researcher and communications advisor for Nationaal Monument Kamp Amersfoort",

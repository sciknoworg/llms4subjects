                "The book highlights recent developments in the field of biomedical systems covering a wide range of technological aspects, methods, systems and instrumentation techniques for diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and assistance. Biomedical systems are becoming increasingly important in medicine and in special areas of application such as supporting people with disabilities and under pandemic conditions. They provide a solid basis for supporting people and improving their health care. As such, the book offers a key reference guide about novel medical systems for students, engineers, designers, and technicians. .",

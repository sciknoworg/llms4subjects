            "abstract": "A collection of essays by a Nobel Prize Laureate on a wide range of critical issues facing the world, and the role of scientists in solving these problems. Kendall has been closely involved with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that began as an informal assocation at MIT in 1969 to protest US involvement in Vietnam and is today an organization with an annual budget exceeding $6 million, with 100,000 supporters worldwide. UCD is today a voice of authority in US government science policy, particularly with regard to environment issues, most recently the worldwide initiatives on global warming. Together, these essays represent both the sucessses and failures of science to impact public policy, the challenges facing scientists, and offers practical guidelines for involvement in science policy. The essays are roughly chronological, organized by subject with introductions, beginning with the controversies on nuclear power safety and Three Mile Island,then followed by sections on national security issues, global environmental and resource problems,and radioactive cleanup and other current issues. Kendall's Nobel Prize lecture as well as a more popular version thereof is also included (and is the only really technical material in the book). The photos in the book are Kendall's, from an 1992 exhibition of his work. Henry Kendall was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics (jointly with J.I.Friedman and R.E. Taylor) in 1990 for his research in the structure of the proton and netron. In 1969, he was one of a group of physicist who founded the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) and is currently Chairman of its Board of Directors",

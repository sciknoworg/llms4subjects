                "This book examines de facto regulation frameworks and methods in a variety of areas, such as banking, transportation, cyberspace, the non-profit sector, and more. Authored by experts in the field, this book deals with the \u201cbig\u201d questions about the idea of regulation. It reveals the tentativeness of current regulatory schemes, the difficulties in balancing between the shared objective of protecting the public interest and other interests such as market stability, and promoting competition. The case studies point to the need for better planning and for more coherent policies. This collection offers to students of public policy, management and law, policy makers and practitioners a broad spectrum of insights\u2014theoretical and practical\u2014and contributes to the ongoing deliberations on the ways that regulatory arrangements could serve the public interest more efficiently. Eyal Tevet is a researcher in the Department of Sociology, Political Science, and Communications at the Open University, Israel. He is also the academic co-director of a study on regulation in Israel, conducted at the Center for Social Justice and Democracy at The Van Leer Jerusalem Institute. Varda Shiffer is Senior Research Fellow at The Van Leer Jerusalem Institute, Israel. Her research focuses on privatization and regulation in the Israeli education system and, since 2013, she has been director of the program for developing models of collaborative governance in local authorities. Dr Shiffer was previously President of the Mandel Foundation, Israel, and founded the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev. Itzhak Galnoor is Herbert Samuel Professor of Political Science (Emeritus) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, and Senior Research Fellow at The Van Leer Jerusalem Institute.",

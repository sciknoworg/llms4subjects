                "This volume contains the articles contributed to the Minnesota Con\u00ad ference on Complex Analysis (COCA). The Conference was held March 16-21, 1964, at the University of Minnesota, under the sponsorship of the U. S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research with thirty-one invited participants attending. Of these, nineteen presented their papers in person in the form of one-hour lectures. In addition, this volume con\u00ad tains papers contributed by other attending participants as well as by participants who, after having planned to attend, were unable to do so. The list of particip ants, as well as the contributions to these Proceed\u00ad ings, clearly do not represent a complete coverage of the activities in all fields of complex analysis. It is hoped, however, that these limitations stemming from the partly deliberate selections will allow a fairly com\u00ad prehensive account of the current research in some of those areas of complex analysis that, in the editors' belief, have rapidly developed during the past decade and may remain as active in the foreseeable future as they are at the present time. In conclusion, the editors wish to thank, first of all, the participants and contributors to these Proceedings for their enthusiastic cooperation and encouragement. Our thanks are due also to the University of Min\u00ad nesota, for offering the physical facilities for the Conference, and to Springer-Verlag for publishing these proceedings."

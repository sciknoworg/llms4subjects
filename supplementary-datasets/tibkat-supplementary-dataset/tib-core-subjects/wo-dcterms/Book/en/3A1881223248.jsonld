                "The book provides an examination of the evolution of China and Taiwan after 1949. This starting point situates the contestation for power between the two entities in the region after Taipei was recognized by the international community as the representative of China. The ramifications for Taiwan were drastic as country after country switched its recognition to China including those in the Caribbean and Latin America. Taiwan was able to maintain diplomatic relations with several countries in both regions through diplomatic strategies including providing financial assistance. This has waned over time considering China\u2019s economic rise to power and Western Europe\u2019s and the United States\u2019 fall in global economic and political prestige and power. This book discusses China\u2019s and Taiwan\u2019s continuing engagement with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean with a particular emphasis on the sharp rise in trade between China and the two regions. China\u2019s foreign policy agenda, and how Taiwan reacts to China\u2019s policies, are also examined. Cassandra Rachel Veney is Executive Director of the Humanities in Leadership Learning Series at Case Western Reserve University. Sabella Abidde is Professor of Political Science at Alabama State University. He is the editor of the two book series: African Governance, Development, and Leadership and Africa-East Asia International Relations.",

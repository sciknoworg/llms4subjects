            "abstract": "This book encourages and demonstrates an innovative approach to the design and operation of urban wastewater systems: integrated modelling and control. Consideration of sewer system, wastewater treatment plant and receiving water body as a single system (rather than as three moderately independent units as before) opens up new types of analyses and new control algorithms for urban wastewater systems. After a comprehensive review of the literature of various fields including processes affecting water flow and quality in urban wastewater systems and their description by different types of models, this book also introduces some of the fundamental concepts of the operation of such systems. It discusses conventional as well as innovative control approaches - ranging from control by simple set-points to elaborate hierarchical control concepts taking into account the water flow and the quality of sewer systems, treatment plants and receiving water body. Thus it will enable the researcher as well as the practising engineer to analyse and to implement various types of control for a particular case study site. In order to illustrate the concepts developed, a detailed simulation study, covering the complete urban wastewater system, is presented. The conclusions drawn demonstrate that the application of innovative control concepts can lead to improved performance of wastewater systems. In addition, a comprehensive survey of mathematical optimisation methods is presented. This book can assist the practising engineer and the student to gain knowledge of all aspects of wastewater systems. To the researcher, this book provides a thorough survey of existing simulation and control concepts and inspiration for further work",

                "\"This book presents a detailed analysis of the experiences of (minority ethnic) physical education (PE) teachers in both schools and higher education contexts. It examines and questions the lack of ethnic diversity in PE teacher education in high income developed countries and suggests important new directions for transformative pedagogy to address the 'whiteness' of PE. The book draws on auto-ethnographical research conducted in Sydney, Australia - one of the world's most culturally diverse cities - and in cities of the United Kingdom. The study is rooted in the concept of 'trans-locality', the networks that extend beyond the immediate community. It explores the challenges faced by PE teachers in culturally diverse workplaces, and the interconnections between place, institutions, and the parallel processes of mobility and globalisation. To understand and theorise the myriad of interactions and practice around diversity, differences, and social justice among lecturers, teachers, and students across the two locations, the book offers an emerging area of scholarship that focuses on a trans-local perspective in diversity and inclusion in Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE). Diversity, Difference and Social Justice in Physical Education will be of significance to those who manage, teach and research issues associated with diversity and advocate for diversifying the teaching workforce in PETE\"--",

            "abstract": "Boron plays a pivotal role in the development of innovative boron-based materials, endowed with properties of paramount significance in both the manufacturing and performance aspects of numerous products crucial to modern society. Over the past few decades, there has been a burgeoning interest in boron, its compounds, and boron-based materials within the scientific and technological communities. This heightened attention stems from their exceptional potential applications across a wide spectrum of fields, spanning from materials science to biomedical research, owing to their remarkable characteristics. These extraordinary properties make them compelling candidates for a diverse array of applications in industry and everyday life. These applications encompass biotechnology, medicine (drug delivery systems and technologies, bioimaging systems, and radiation therapy), agriculture, radiation-shielding materials, capping agents, and mechanical strength, among others. However, despite extensive research, many aspects of boron\u2019s properties remain shrouded in mystery, presenting practical challenges. This book delves deep into the realm of boron-based nanomaterials, shedding light on their properties and providing an up-to-date overview of the latest breakthroughs in boron and its compounds. It offers insights into the industrial, medical, and everyday applications of boron-containing materials. The book is a comprehensive resource for seasoned professionals, scientists, and scholars in pursuit of cutting-edge technological advancements. Comprising research articles and reviews, it is an invaluable reference for both students and scholars engaged in the exploration of boron and boron-based materials",

            "abstract": "Walters Way and Segal Close are two tiny roads in Lewisham, South London. The twenty homes they contain are unusual, both in the way they look and the way they were built. Designed by modernist architect Walter Segal, the homes on Walters Way and Segal Close were part of a plan that allowed ordinary people to build their own homes. Thirty years on, many of the homes are still standing and have been adapted to meet today's needs. Written by two residents of Walters Way and Segal Close, this beautifully illustrated book tells the story of how the streets came to be and how the developments have changed since. Neither Alice Grahame nor Taran Wilkhu are the original inhabitants of their respective homes, but they were instantly fascinated upon moving in by the story of how and why the homes came to be. Walters Way and Segal Close was created in collaboration with all of the residents of both streets, who opened their homes and shared their insights about life on the two streets",

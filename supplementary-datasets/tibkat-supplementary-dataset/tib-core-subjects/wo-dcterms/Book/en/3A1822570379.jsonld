            "abstract": "\"Due to tremendous shifts in the business environment of contemporary organizations following the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to redefine the role and importance of IT support, which is essential for ensuring an organizations survival. Current models are no longer valid, as the need for IT support is more crucial and indispensable than ever in the new a turbulent, digitalized environment. This book proposes a new model explaining the factors influencing the efficiency of adaptable IT support in contemporary organizations, including those operating normally and during crises. The author demonstrates how organizations benefit from IT support, not only by enabling higher performance but also facilitating organizational continuity, reliability and even survival during various stages of crisis. The proposed model provides a basis for theory development in the field of organizational continuity and reliability, offering a new body of knowledge related to the factors boosting organizational performance gained from IT support and enabling organizational survival. This book will provide valuable findings for scholars performing research in the field of IT use in organizations, information technology management, crisis management and organizational reliability\"--",

            "abstract": "\"Earth's interior consists of the rocky mantle and metallic core. They are the most remarkable layers in terrestrial planets. However, detailed composition of the lower mantle and core, particularly, the light elements in the core, physical and chemical state of silicate minerals as well as metallic phases in the core-mantle boundary region and material transport between core and mantle through time and space have not been studied in detail. Seismological observations have suggested that strong heterogeneous features exist, as a result of vigorous convective dynamics at the core-mantle boundary region, which seems to be in contrast with geochemical views suggesting the presence of stable regions. These, so called as primordial reservoirs, are supposed to hold the geochemical signature of early Earth's accretion and differentiation at around 4.6 billion years ago. Moreover, the abundance of radioactive elements in the deep Earth that act as the primary heat sources that drive the dynamic behaviors of the deep Earth are greatly uncertain and unexplored. Recent technological advances in seismological observations, experimental knowhow, analytical resolution and computational network has revolutionized our understanding on deep Earth processes. In seismology, dense observational networks in Thailand, Pacific and USArray are simultaneously available, which can access much finer resolution of seismic imaging of heterogeneous structure in the deep Earth. In particular, the origin of anomalous structure in the uppermost outer core could be resolved. Experimental physicists have achieved record pressures of multi megabars that can ideally help to understand even exoplanetary and Super-Earth interiors. The advances in analytical precision and accuracy and application in geochemistry and cosmochemistry has been well documented in examples such as those in Hayabusa returned \"dust\" samples. The accessibility of supercomputers for simulations on convective processes in metallic core and silicate mantle and material properties finding first principle computations have also revolutionized our understanding of deep planetary interior. Therefore, it is imminent that it is high time for experts from all these communities to come under a single umbrella and work together.\"--",

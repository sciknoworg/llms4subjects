            "abstract": "The cultural, social, and economic history of mankind is characterized by a succession of needs and problems that have stimulated the invention of operational and conceptual tools to facilitate their solution. The continuous presentation of new needs, an attempt to improve partial solutions to old problems, curiosity, and the disinterested search for knowledge then constituted the fundamental push for scientific, cultural, economic, and social progress. In an increasingly digital society, where software technological tools permeate daily life and, consequently, change the management of reality, mastering of transversal skills is crucial for success. Computational thinking is a set of transversal skills related to the foundations of computer science as a scientific discipline and means a mastering to the process of solving problems. The goal of computational thinking is to acquire interpretative perspectives of reality, which allows one to read the digital experience competently and responsibly.Computational Thinking for Problem Solving and Managerial Mindset Training explores how individuals can be trained into managerial mindsets through computational thinking and computer science. It explores how computer science can be used as a valid guideline to develop skills such as effective soft skills, communication skills, and collaboration. Further, the chapters explore the adoption of computational thinking for individuals to gain managerial mindsets and successfully solve questions and problems in their domain of interest. This will include artificial intelligence applications, strategic thinking, management training, ethics, emergency managerial mindsets, and more. This book is valuable for managers, professionals, practitioners, researchers, academicians, and students interested in how computational thinking can be applied for the training of managerial mindsets",

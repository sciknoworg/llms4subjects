            "abstract": "This book brings together the knowledge from a variety of topics within the field of geochemistry. The audience for this book consists of a multitude of scientists such as physicists, geologists, technologists, petroleum engineers, volcanologists, geochemists and government agencies. The topics represented facilitate as establishing a starting point for new ideas and further contributions. An effective management of geological and environmental issues requires the understanding of recent research in minerals, soil, ores, rocks, water, sediments. The use of geostatistical and geochemical methods relies heavily on the extraction of this book. The research presented was carried out by experts and is therefore highly recommended to scientists, under- and post-graduate students who want to gain knowledge about the recent developments in geochemistry and benefit from an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of the earth's system processes",

            "abstract": "\"Join the cutting edge of biomedical technology with this essential reference The role of wireless communications in biomedical technology is a significant one. Wireless and/or antenna-driven communication between telemetry components now forms the basis of cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, cochlear implants, glucose readers, and more. As wireless technology continues to advance and miniaturization progresses, it's more essential than ever that biomedical research and development incorporate the latest technology. Antennas and Wireless Power for Biomedical Applications provides a comprehensive introduction to wireless technology and its incorporation into the biomedical field. Beginning with an introduction to recent developments in antenna and wireless technology, it analyzes the major wireless systems currently available and their biomedical applications, actual and potential. The result is an essential guide to technologies that have already improved patient outcomes and increased life expectancies worldwide. Antennas and Wireless Power for Biomedical Applications readers will also find: Authored by internationally renowned researchers of wireless technologies Detailed analysis of CP implantable antennas, wearable antennas, near-field wireless power, and more Up to 100 figures that supplement text Antennas and Wireless Power for Biomedical Applications is a valuable introduction for biomedical researchers and biomedical engineers, as well as for research and development professionals in the medical device industry.\"--",

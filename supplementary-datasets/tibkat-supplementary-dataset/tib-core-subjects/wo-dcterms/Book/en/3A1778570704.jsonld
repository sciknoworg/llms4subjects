            "abstract": "This book watches out for the issues on making moves for chest radiology in carcinoma of the chest. It focuses on all parts of radiological approaches to manage the breast illness, be it light (optical), sound (ultrasound), interest, microwave, electrical impedance, blend of these modalities, and a section of the incredibly intense issues on computer-aided detection. The dedication of the eminent analysts in this book has incorporated a lot of energy for the people who are adequately drawn in with the clinical organization of this ailment and also for the students of radiology and surgery alike. This book will definitely be appreciated and well taken by the surgeons, radiologists, and other professionals involved in this field. The contributions are excellent in terms of diagnostic approach by radiological means and would certainly be a step forward in making it possible to reach to a conclusive diagnosis of breast cancer much before it becomes inoperable. The chapters included will further our knowledge and to the best of my belief will make things easier and definable in terms of diagnosis of breast cancer",

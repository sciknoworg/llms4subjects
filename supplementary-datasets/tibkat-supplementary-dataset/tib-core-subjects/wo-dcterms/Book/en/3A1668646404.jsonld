            "abstract": "The Encyclopedia of Big Data Technologies provides IT professionals, educators, researchers and students with a comprehensive set of definitions covering the most relevant Big Data technologies. The encyclopedia articles will be authored by a worldwide subject matter experts in industry and academia, this unique publication, in multiple volumes, covers a wide range of Big Data topics. The editorial board of the encyclopedia consists of 35 well-respected scholars. The sections are designed to capture the most relevant terms and assigned to experts that develop articles in a consistent and standardized way. This extensive reference work answers the need for solid and comprehensive research source in the domain of big data technologies. The encyclopedia will not be focused only on one discipline, research area or one type of data. It will cover all related technical disciplines for big data technologies such as big data storage systems, NoSQL database, cloud computing, distributed systems, machine learning and social technologies. In particular, this encyclopedia will provide comprehensive reading materials for a large range of audiences and has potential to influence readers to think further and investigate the area that are novel to them.

We are communicating applications in probability theory and statistics (A Test Detecting the Outliers for Continuous Distributions Based on the Cumulative Distribution Function of the Data Being Tested, The Asymmetric Alpha-Power Skew-t Distribution), fractals - geometry and alike (Khovanov Homology of Three-Strand Braid Links, Volume Preserving Maps Between p-Balls, Generation of Julia and Mandelbrot Sets via Fixed Points), supersymmetry - physics, nanostructures -chemistry, taxonomy - biology and alike (A Continuous Coordinate System for the Plane by Triangular Symmetry, One-Dimensional Optimal System for 2D Rotating Ideal Gas, Minimal Energy Configurations of Finite Molecular Arrays, Noether-Like Operators and First Integrals for Generalized Systems of Lane-Emden Equations), algorithms, programs and software analysis (Algorithm for Neutrosophic Soft Sets in Stochastic Multi-Criteria Group Decision Making Based on Prospect Theory, On a Reduced Cost Higher Order Traub-Steffensen-Like Method for Nonlinear Systems, On a Class of Optimal Fourth Order Multiple Root Solvers without Using Derivatives) to specific subjects (Facility Location Problem Approach for Distributed Drones, Parametric Jensen-Shannon Statistical Complexity and Its Applications on Full-Scale Compartment Fire Data). Diverse topics are thus combined to map out the mathematical core of practical problems",

            "abstract": "Steel has become the most requested material all over the world during the rapid technological evolution of recent centuries. As our civilization grows and its technological development becomes connected with more demanding processes, it is more and more challenging to fit the required physical and mechanical properties for steel in its huge portfolio of grades for each steel producer. It is necessary to improve the refining and casting processes continuously to meet customer requirements and to lower the production costs to remain competitive. New challenges related to both the precise design of steel properties and reduction in production costs are combined with paying special attention to environmental protection. These contradictory demands are the theme of this book",

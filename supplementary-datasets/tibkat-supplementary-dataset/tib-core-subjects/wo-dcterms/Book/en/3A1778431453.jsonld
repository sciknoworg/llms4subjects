            "abstract": "The book is addressed to architects and civil engineers. Design and research are areas connecting their activities. The contents of the book confirm the fact that the interface between architecture and engineering is multidimensional. The ways of finding points of contact between the two industries are highlighted. This is favored by the dynamically changing reality, supported by new design paradigms and new research techniques. The multithreaded subject matter of the articles is reduced to six sections: Research Scopes, Methods, Design Aspects, Context, Nature of Research, and Economy and Cost Calculation. Each of the articles in these six blocks has its weight. And so, in the Nature of Research section, the following areas have been underscored: laboratory tests, in situ research, field investigations, and street perception experiments. The section Design Aspects includes design-oriented thinking, geometrical forms, location of buildings, cost prediction, attractor and distractor elements, and shaping spatial structures. The new design and research tools are an inspiration and a keystone bonding architects and engineers",

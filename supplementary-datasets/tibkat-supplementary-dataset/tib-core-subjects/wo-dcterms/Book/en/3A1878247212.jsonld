            "abstract": "\"This book examines the prevailing concept that one person can take a new idea and turn it into an innovative product within the context of an existing company -- the intrapreneur or \"corporate innovator\" as the author puts it. This position, derived from entrepreneurship, dominates the popular imagination. However, this is not completely accurate -- even if you are one person with an idea, you can't implement it alone and you will face headwinds. The people who help you are \"allies,\" and the people who oppose your idea are \"obstacles.\" As an innovator who isn't a leader, one must effectively communicate their ideas and the influence said ideas offer to win support for such intrapreneurship. Corporate Innovator offers practical advice and examples for how a corporate innovator can win allies and overcome obstacles to get from idea to action: that is, to get the company to go ahead and implement your idea. This requires a different strategic approach from traditional entrepreneurial thought\"--",

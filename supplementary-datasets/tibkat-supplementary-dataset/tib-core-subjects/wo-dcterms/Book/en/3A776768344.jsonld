            "abstract": "\"From Soil Behavior Fundamentals to Innovations in Geotechnical Engineering, GSP 233, honors the technical contribution of Roy Olson, Ph.D., P.E., NAE, Distinguished Member ASCE. This Geotechnical Special Publication contains a total of 51 papers, 21 authored or co-authored by Prof. Olson along with 30 peer-reviewed contemporary, invited or submitted papers. Olson's early work dealt with clay behavior, consolidation analyses, and compaction of unsaturated soils. His later work focused on applications of soil behavior in foundation and forensic engineering including axial capacity of piles in sand and clay, pull out capacity of suction caisson foundations, and failures of excavations and bulkhead structures. Contemporary innovations discussed in papers contributed to this volume include developments in consolidation analyses, modeling of shear strength, measurements of permeability, and interpretation of in-situ tests. Lessons learned from failures along with recent developments in foundation engineering such as characterization of energy piles, calculation of settlement from dynamic soil properties, developments in finite element modeling of foundations, mechanism of failure of jacked piles, mitigation of piling noise, and field load tests on a variety of foundations are also included\"--Provided by publisher",

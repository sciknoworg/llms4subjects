            "abstract": "\"Phytochemistry in Corrosion Science covers the use of plant extracts/phytochemicals in corrosion mitigation with industrial applications. It explores innovative and characterization approaches towards the utilization of plant extracts and their phytochemicals as potential corrosion inhibitors for several metals and their alloys. Providing a comprehensive overview of the green aspects of plant extracts as corrosion inhibitors, the book discusses the preparation of aqueous and organic phase extracts, their advantages, disadvantages, and use for different aggressive media. It also examines aqueous and organic extracts that have been successfully used as corrosion inhibitors for various metals and electrolyte combinations. The book will be a useful reference for undergraduate and graduate students and academic researchers in the fields of phytochemistry, corrosion science and engineering, environmental science, chemical engineering, green chemistry, and mechanical/industrial engineering\"--",

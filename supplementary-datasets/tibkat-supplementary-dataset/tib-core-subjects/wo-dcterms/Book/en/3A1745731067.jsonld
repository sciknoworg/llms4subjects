            "abstract": "\"This book covers the fundamentals and applications of Carbon Nanofiber (CNF). In the first section, the initial chapter on the fundamentals of CNF is by Professor Maheshwar Sharon, the recognized \"Father of Carbon Nanotechnology in India\", which powerfully provides a succinct overview of CNFs. This is followed by a chapter on biogenics that have produced unique morphologies of CNF that makes them suitable to various applications. This is followed by a chapter that mainly focuses on nanocomposites, especially those involving nanocomposites of CNF. The role of nanocatalysts and composites in promoting and enhancing the synthesis and application of CNF is then covered, followed by an important chapter on the characterization of CNF. The second section of the book encompasses the various applications of CNF, such as its use as a possible superconductor to adsorb and store hydrogen, and as a microwave absorber. The application of CNF for environmental concerns is also detailed by assessing its usefulness in dye and heavy metal removal from polluted water. The applications that are addressed include lithium-ion battery, solar cell, antenna, cosmetics, usefulness in regenerative medicine, as well as various aspects of agrotechnology\"--",

            "abstract": "This book helps to solve the problems and challenges of satellite sensing in the current environment of increasing communications bandwidths and multiplicity of electromagnetic signals. It presents technology that makes full use of the broadband low-loss advantages of optoelectronic technology and research into new broadband radio-frequency channelization and receiving technology based on photoelectric sensing. The methods presented allow improvements in system performance in terms of receiving bandwidth, frequency-sensing accuracy, channel equalization, adjacent channel crosstalk, dynamic range, and complexity of the system structure. In addressing the difficulty of satellite spectrum control, including the issue of high-precision and real-time wide-spectrum sensing not being able to be obtained simultaneously, the book solves the problem of accurate and parallel-decomposition sensing technology using the dual-phase optical frequency comb. This method avoids the involvement of fine filtering and does not require fine alignment between the source and the filter but achieves high perceptual accuracy. Satellite Photoelectric Sensing Technology explores the research background, significance, and current challenges associated with the technology, making it relevant and interesting to academics, practitioners, and postgraduate students in this field.",

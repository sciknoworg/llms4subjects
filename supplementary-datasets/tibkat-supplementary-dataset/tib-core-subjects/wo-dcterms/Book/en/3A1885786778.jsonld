In this context, the concept of \u201cscientific excellence\u201d has been perceived as a guiding idea in the scholars\u2019 efforts. At the same time, it can be seen as an ideal that can never be achieved but towards which one ought to strive persistently. Additionally, the pursuit of perfection is accompanied by paradoxes, which have been pointed out many times in the history of human thought. The volume embodies the belief in the existence of an invisible college understood as a research community embodied by young scientists starting their academic path inspired by recognized professors",

The 14 full papers included in this book were carefully reviewed and selected from 41 submission. The proceedings also include 5 short papers from the Test-Comp 2024 event that was hosted by FASE. They deal with the broad field of software engineering, focusing on requirements, design, architecture, modeling, applications of AI to software engineering and software engineering for AI-based systems, quality, model-driven engineering, processes, and software evolution. ."

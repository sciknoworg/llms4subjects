            "abstract": "When it was originally published in 2002, Sue Curry Jansen\u2019s \u201cWhat Was Artificial Intelligence?\u201d attracted little notice. The long essay was published as a chapter in Jansen\u2019s Critical Communication Theory, a book whose wisdom and erudition failed to register across the many fields it addressed. One explanation for the neglect, ironic and telling, is that Jansen\u2019s sheer scope as an intellectual had few competent readers in the communication studies discipline into which she published the book. \u201cWhat Was Artificial Intelligence?\u201d was buried treasure. In this mediastudies.press edition, Jansen\u2019s prescient autopsy of AI self-selling\u2014the rhetoric of the masculinist sublime\u2014is reprinted with a new introduction. Now an open access book, \u201cWhat Was Artificial Intelligence?\u201d is a message in a bottle, addressed to Musk, Bezos, and the latest generation of AI myth-makers",

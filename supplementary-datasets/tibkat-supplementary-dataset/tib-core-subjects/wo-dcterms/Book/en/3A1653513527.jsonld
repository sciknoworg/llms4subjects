            "abstract": "Is the online trade with second-hand products changing individual consumer behaviour? What is the sustainability potential of this activity? How can daily energy-consuming routines at the workplace be changed? Do major changes in the course of people\u2019s lives represent opportunities to modify their consumer behaviour towards greater sustainability? These are only some of the research questions studied in the focal topic \u00bbFrom Knowledge to Action \u2013 New Paths towards Sustainable Consumption\u00ab which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the \u00bbSocial-ecological Research Programme\u00ab (S\u00d6F). This book gives an insight into the research results of the ten project groups. Their diversity highlights that there is much more to \u00bbsustainable consumption\u00ab than the simple purchase of organic or fair trade products. In addition, overarching conceptual and normative issues were treated across the project groups of the focal topic. Developed collaboratively and moderated by the accompanying research project, the results of the synthesis process are also presented here, as for example how the sustainability of individual consumer behaviour can be evaluated, or which theories of action are particularly useful for specific consumer behaviour phenomena.The editors lead the accompanying research project \u00bbFocussing knowledge \u2013 Encouraging commitment \u2013 Facilitating mastery\u00ab in the focal topic. They all work at the Interdisciplinary Centre for General Ecology (IKA\u00d6) at the University of Bern. They have carried out numerous research projects \u2013 often of an inter- and transdisciplinary nature \u2013 on ecologically responsible actions in the context of sustainable development. They also study issues relating to inter- and transdisciplinarity and moderate the synthesis processes in project groups.",

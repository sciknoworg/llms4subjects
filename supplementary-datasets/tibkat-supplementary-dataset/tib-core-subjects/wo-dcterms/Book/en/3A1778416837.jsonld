            "abstract": "The rapid development of advanced, arguably, intelligent sensors and their massive deployment provide a foundation for new paradigms to combat the challenges that arise in significant tasks such as positioning, tracking, navigation, and smart sensing in various environments. Relevant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also finding rapid adoption by industry and fan the fire. Consequently, research on intelligent sensing systems and technologies has attracted considerable attention during the past decade, leading to a variety of effective applications related to intelligent transportation, autonomous vehicles, wearable computing, wireless sensor networks (WSN), and the internet of things (IoT). In particular, the sensors community has a great interest in novel, intelligent information fusion, and data mining methods coupling AI and ML for substantial performance enhancement, especially for the challenging scenarios that make traditional approaches inappropriate. This reprint book has collected 14 excellent papers that represent state-of-the-art achievements in the relevant topics and provides cutting-edge coverage of recent advances in sensor signal and data mining techniques, algorithms, and approaches, particularly applied for positioning, tracking, navigation, and smart sensing",

            "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as a key part of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, have become increasingly important in recent years, owing to their potential impact on building a more sustainable future. Compared with other batteries developed, LIBs offer high energy density, high discharge power, and a long service life. These characteristics have facilitated a remarkable advance of LIBs in many frontiers, including electric vehicles, portable and flexible electronics, and stationary applications. Since the field of LIBs is advancing rapidly and attracting an increasing number of researchers, it is necessary to often provide the community with the latest updates. Therefore, this book was designed to focus on updating the electrochemical community with the latest advances and prospects on various aspects of LIBs. The materials presented in this book cover advances in several fronts of the technology, ranging from detailed fundamental studies of the electrochemical cell to investigations to better improve parameters related to battery packs",

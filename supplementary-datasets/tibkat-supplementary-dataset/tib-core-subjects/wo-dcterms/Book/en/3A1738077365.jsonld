                "The multilingualism and polyphony of Jewish literary writing across the globe demands a collaborative, comparative, and interdisciplinary investigation into questions regarding methods of researching and teaching literatures. Disseminating Jewish Literatures compiles case studies that represent a broad range of epistemological and textual approaches to the curricula and research programs of literature departments in Europe, Israel, and the United States. In doing so, it promotes the integration of Jewish literatures into national philologies and the implementation of comparative, transnational approaches to the reading, teaching, and researching of literatures. Instead of a dichotomizing approach, Disseminating Jewish Literatures endorses an exhaustive, comprehensive conceptualization of the Jewish literary corpus across languages. Included in this volume are essays on literatures in Arabic, English, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish, as well as essays reflecting the fields of Yiddish philology and Latin American studies. The volume is based on the papers presented at the Gentner Symposium funded by the Minerva Foundation, held at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin in June 2018"

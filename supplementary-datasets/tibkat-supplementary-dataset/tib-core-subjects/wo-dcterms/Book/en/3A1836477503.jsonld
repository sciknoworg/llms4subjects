            "title": "Chapter Pretargeted Theranostics",
            "abstract": "Personalized medicine is becoming an integral part of our healthcare system, in which theranostics play a fundamental role. Nanomedicines such as monoclonal antibodies are a commonly used targeting vector in such approaches due to their outstanding targeting abilities as well as their capabilities to function as drug delivery vehicles. However, the application of nanomedicines in a clinical setting is connected with several challenges. For example, nanomedicines typically possess slow pharmacokinetics in respect to target accumulation and excretion. For targeted radionuclide therapy, this results in high radiation burden to healthy tissue. For drug delivery systems, long circulation and excretion times of the nanomedicine complicate site-specific release approaches and limit as such the usability of these strategies. One way to circumvent these challenges is the use of pretargeting strategies, which allow to separate the accumulation and excretion of nanomedicines from the actual diagnostic or therapeutic application. As such, pretargeting allows to use theranostic concepts utilizing the same nanomedicine and determine the success chances with diagnostic measures before initiating therapy. This chapter will explain the concept of pretargeted theranostics, which pretargeting systems have thus far been developed and compare how these systems performed",

                "In this authoritative collection, Professor Andreff presents the most significant articles published over the last decade or so by leading scholars in the field of sports economics. The volumes cover a wide spectrum of approaches to the subject. Some articles delve more deeply into existing issues such as the economic impact of professional sport, sports events and sports facilities. Some extend sports economics into new areas such as the measurement of the overall US sports economy, the economic underdevelopment of sports in developing countries and the global trade in sports goods. Others offer a synthetic view of important recent developments in the field, including the demand for sport, facility finance, the economics of promotion and relegation in sports leagues and competitive balance. Professor Andreff has written a comprehensive new introduction which gives a thorough overview of this topical subject",

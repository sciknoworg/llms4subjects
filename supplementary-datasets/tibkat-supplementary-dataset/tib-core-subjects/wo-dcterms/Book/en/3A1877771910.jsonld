            "abstract": "This open access book\u2019s theme is Teaching mathematics as to be meaningful \u2013 foregrounding children\u2019s play and perspectives. It discusses the relation between teachers, children and mathematical content within the context of play with a particular focus on the framing of these relations within this context, which is an important theme in the debate on whether teaching should be integrated with or separated from children\u2019s play. The work further addresses meaningfulness in the learning process, particularly from the child\u2019s perspective. Globally, most guidelines and curricula for early childhood education mention play as one of the key features for young children\u2019s learning. Still, there are quite different views on the definitions of play and in what ways play should become part of children\u2019s learning. The chapters of the book mirror the research topics presented at the fifth POEM conference in May 2022 divided into four sub-themes: Play and learning, Children\u2019s perspectives on mathematics, Teachers\u2019 competencies and Theorizing aspects of early mathematics education",

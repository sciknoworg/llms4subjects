            "abstract": "This paper provides an account of the Emerging Markets Corporate Governance Research Network (EMCGN) and its first 10 years of activities. The network was established under the auspices of the Global Corporate Governance Forum (now incorporated into IFC's Corporate Governance Group). The paper describes the history of the EMCGN and its objective (to stimulate research focused on corporate governance in emerging markets as well as transition and developing countries); its structure, which is a joint undertaking of corporate governance research centers and internationally recognized scholars, with IFC Corporate Governance acting as its catalyst; and its modalities: organizing workshops, holding biennial conferences, and disseminating and communicating research. The paper reviews the quantity and quality of EMCGN's output, based on objective research rankings, and its effects on countries in capacity building and policy changes and development, based on the experiences of participants and policymakers exposed to its work. Analysis of publication data shows that EMCGN has been successful in encouraging research on corporate governance in emerging markets in most areas of research identified as critical at the Network's inception and through its interactions with practitioners and policymakers. EMCGN also has been successful in stimulating collaborative research and facilitating dialogue between scholars and the larger corporate governance community. Its impact on policy and practice development, inherently difficult to pinpoint, seems to have been most effective when channeled through efforts of local corporate governance associations with professional members to influence relevant policymakers and when actively using media to communicate the need for key reforms",

                "Textbooks in the field of control engineering have, in the main, been written for electrical engineers and the standard of the mathematics used has been relatively high. The purpose of this work is to provide a course of study in elementary control theory which is self-contained and suitable for students of all branches of engineering and of applied physics. The book assumes that the student has a knowledge of mathematics of A-level or 0-2 level standard only. All other necessary pure and applied mathematics is covered for reference purposes in chapters 2-6. As a students' textbook it contains many fully worked numerical examples and sets of examples are provided at the end of all chapters except the first. The answers to these examples are given at the end of the book. The book covers the majority of the control theory likely to be encountered on H. N. C. , H. N. D. and degree courses in electrical, mechanical, chemical and production engineering and in applied physics. It will also provide a primer in specialist courses in instru\u00ad mentation and control engineering at undergraduate and post\u00ad graduate level. Furthermore, it covers much of the control theory encountered in the graduateship examinations of the professional institutions, for example I. E. E. Part III (Advanced Electrical Engineer\u00ad ing and Instrumentation and Control), I. E. R. E. Part 5 (Control Engineering) and the new c. E. I. Part 2 (Mechanics of Machines and Systems and Control Engineering)."

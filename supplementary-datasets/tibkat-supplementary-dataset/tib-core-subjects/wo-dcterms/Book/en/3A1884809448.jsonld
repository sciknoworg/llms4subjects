            "abstract": [
                "This book offers a history of migration in the Mediterranean written about and from the perspective of women. It gives a complex picture of individual journeys of migrant women, and in a radical departure from the miserabilist or culturalist approach through which women are usually viewed, and instead argues for a politically and socially aware feminism that is attuned to what border-obsessed migration policies actually do to women. The book depicts the journey of women as they experience brutal separations and make heart-wrenching decisions, but also as they make acquaintances and find new opportunities. The first-person accounts collected here demonstrate that the reasons behind these women\u2019s decision to leave are anything but simple and linear: they combine various forms of persecution and oppression with a desire for autonomy.The book further explores the daily lives of women in reception centres as they wait for a Europe that rejects them to acknowledge their presence. At the same time, this study shows that these women are taking charge of their own destinies and journeys. This accordingly puts the space of everyday life front and centre. Such a space acts as an impediment to these women\u2019s journeys: it generates a \u201cmoralscape\u201d of waiting, which plays a key role in these women\u2019s daily lives. However, it can also help these women gain greater autonomy, thus empowering them. Camille Schmoll is Research Director at \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), Fellow of the Institut Convergences Migrations, and a member of the G\u00e9ographie-cit\u00e9s research centre, France. A feminist political geographer, she is especially interested in gender and migration issues, critical migration studies, and reflexivity within migration scholarship. Her work explores migration from an ethnographic perspective, with a particular focus on the making of border-places (e.g. islands, cities, neighbourhoods) and the trajectories of migrant women. She was Editor-in-Chief of the peer-reviewed journal Revue Europ\u00e9enne des Migrations Internationales from 2019 to 2022, and has authored, co-authored and co-edited several books in French, Italian and English.",

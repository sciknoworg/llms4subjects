This book reviews the research on seafood and health, the use and quality aspects of marine lipids and seafood proteins as ingredients in functional foods and consumer acceptance of (marine) functional food. The first chapter covers novel merging areas where seafood may prevent disease and improve health such as in cognitive development, mental health, cancer, allergy and oxidative stress are highlighted. Cases where nutrients in seafood may have health protective effects such as in proteins, peptides, amino acids, selenium, chitosan, glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate are also discussed. The next chapters cover quality aspects of marine lipids and seafood proteins as ingredients in functional foods. Lipids and proteins must have and retain a high quality so that the sensory and functional properties and the shelf life of the final product are acceptable. The methods used for processing marine lipids and proteins, are discussed as well as the different factors that can affect their quality in functional foods. The book then concentrates on factors related to consumers' attitudes, knowledge and awareness of functional foods. There are variations in types of carrier products and of demographic and cross-cultural factors in acceptance of functional foods. Finally, the book discusses challenges for small and medium enterprises to commercialise healthy nutrition. Variations in characteristics, capabilities, challenges and opportunities in the marketplace are presented using a Nordic study as reference",

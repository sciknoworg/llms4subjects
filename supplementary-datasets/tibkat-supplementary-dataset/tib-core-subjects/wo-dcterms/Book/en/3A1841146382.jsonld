            "abstract": "This book examines the European Left\u2019s attempt to think and give shape to an alternative type of European integration\u2014a \u2018social Europe\u2019\u2014during the long 1970s. Based on fresh archival research, it shows that the western European Left\u2014in particular, social democratic parties, trade unions, and to a lesser extent \u2018Eurocommunist\u2019 parties\u2014formulated a broad project to turn \u2018capitalist Europe\u2019 into a \u2018workers\u2019 Europe\u2019. This alternative model of European unity favoured coordinated measures for wealth redistribution, market regulation, a democratization of the economy and of European institutions, upward harmonization of social and fiscal systems, more inclusive welfare regimes, guaranteed employment, economic and social planning with greater consideration for the environment, increased public spending to meet collective needs, greater control of capital flows and multinational corporations, a reduction in working time, and a fairer international economic order favouring the global South. During the pivotal years following 1968, deeply marked by labour militancy, new social movements, economic crisis, and the unmaking of the \u2018postwar compromise\u2019, a window of opportunity opened in which European integration could have taken different roads. The defeat of \u2018social Europe\u2019 was a result of a decade-long social conflict which ended with the affirmation of a neoliberal Europe. Investigating this forgotten power struggle and the reasons of its defeat can be useful not just to scholars and students eager to understand the historical evolution of European integration, the European Left, and European capitalism, but also to anyone interested in building alternative European and global futures",

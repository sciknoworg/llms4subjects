It has been divided into five sections: \u201cMutual Learning Among Civilizations,\u201d \u201cHot Issues,\u201d \u201cAbout China,\u201d \u201cSino-U.S. Relations\u201d and \u201cCultural Collision\u201d. The interviews are with more than 50 eminent scholars, scientists, politicians, authors, etc., from different parts of the world as well as China, who have an association with China and see the real China beyond the stereotypes. Besides current global issues, the book also covers Chinese culture, history as well as China-U.S. relations, described as one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world today. The book aims to build a platform for dialogue among different civilizations and appreciate the \u201charmony within diversity\u201d of different cultures, especially of the East and West. We hope it will foster tolerance and rationality, dispelling the misconceptions about China in particular",

                "Each year around 1.2 million people are killed and 50 million are injured on roads around the world. But crashes are largely preventable and much can be done to reduce the burden of pain they cause and their economic impact. Many countries have set targets to reduce the number of casualties on their roads. Are these countries on track to meet their targets? What can be done in the immediate and longer term to achieve these targets? Is there a limit to traditional approaches to road safety? This report takes stock of recent developments and initiatives to meet increasingly ambitious road safety targets. It highlights the management changes required in many countries to implement effective interventions. It emphasises a strong focus on results and examines the economic case for road safety investment. It challenges the better performing countries to do more and strongly recommends the adoption of a Safe System approach with a Zong-term vision of no fatalities on the roads.The report constitutes a major international review of progress in developing Safe System approaches, now adopted in a small number of countries. The report should be useful to transport administrations and to all stakeholders involved in improving road safety"

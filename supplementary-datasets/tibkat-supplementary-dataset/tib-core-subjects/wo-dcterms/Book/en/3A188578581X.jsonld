            "abstract": "COVID-19 has disrupted all aspects of human life. To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, several efforts have been taken, including by Indonesian scholars abroad. This book entitled Indonesia Post-Pandemic Recovery Outlook: Strategy towards Net-Zero Emissions by 2060 from the Renewables and Carbon-Neutral Energy Perspectives explores energy sustainability and climate change issues and how it can progress further. There are also discussion on the delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to a few major renewable energy projects that should have been done in 2020-2021. Comprising of 14 chapters, this book is divided into three sections. The first part, Indonesia's Current Position and Strategy for Renewable Energy, explores Indonesia's current position and strategy on New and Renewable Energy. This chapter also explores Indonesia's commitment towards Net-Zero Carbon Emission 2060. Second, Carbon-Free and Renewable Energy in Indonesia, discusses the status of renewable energy use in the world, elaborate on the carbon impact of energy shift from fossil to renewable sources, and introduce a new criterion in renewable energy: carbon-neutral energy. The last part, Indonesia's New Strategy to Achieve Net-Zero Emission in 2060, explores the macroeconomic benefits of renewable and carbon-neutral energy deployment which are increasing energy security, fueling GDP development, creating job opportunities, enhancing human welfare, and achieving gender equality. We hope that this book can be a valuable reference for stakeholders, policymakers, as well as society to recover from the pandemic crisis and find better solutions to benefit future generations",

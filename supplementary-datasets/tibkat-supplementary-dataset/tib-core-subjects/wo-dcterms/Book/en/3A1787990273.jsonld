                "\u201cThis groundbreaking book gives shape to what the authors call the \u2018decolonial left,\u2019 which defines itself against the New Cold War rivalries, legacies of British colonialism, and Chinese authoritarianism, to articulate practices of protesting and living in the space of global abolitionism and internationalism from below.\u201d \u2013 Shu-mei Shih, Edward W. Said Professor of Comparative Literature, University of California, Los Angeles, USA \u201cThis breakthrough collection of essays is provocative, sincere, and makes not only a timely contribution to Hong Kong Studies but also thoughtful challenges to all who are concerned about Hong Kong.\u201d \u2013 Law Wing Sang, Adjunct Associate Professor of Cultural Studies, Lingnan University, Hong Kong This collection brings together writing from activists and scholars that examine leftist and decolonial forms of resistance that have emerged from Hong Kong\u2019s contemporary protests. Practices such as labor unionism, police abolition, land justice struggles, and other radical expressions of self-governance may not always operate under the banners of leftism and decoloniality; yet, examining them within these frameworks uncovers historical and prefigurative sightlines that reveal their significance to Hong Kong\u2019s future, and interlaces the city\u2019s struggles with others around the world.

JN Chien is a Ph.D. candidate in American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. His writing has appeared in Hong Kong Studies, The Nation, Jacobin, and Lausan.

            "abstract": "\"This book covers advances in fusion and solid-state welding processes including basics, welding metallurgy, defect formation and effect of process parameters on mechanical properties. The microstructural and mechanical behaviour of the weldments are included. It covers challenges encountered during dissimilar welding of metal by fusion and solid-state welding process including remedial solution and hybrid process to counter the same. Numerical and statistical simulation approaches used in the welding process for parameter optimization and material flow studies is described as well. Features: Provide the details related to microstructural and mechanical behaviour of welded joints developed by different welding processes. Covers the recent research content, metallurgical analysis, and simulation aspects. Discusses joining of plastics and ceramics. Includes a dedicated chapter on machine learning and digital twin in welding. Explores difficulties associated with the joining of dissimilar metal and alloys. This book is aimed at researchers and graduate students in material joining and characterization, and welding\"",

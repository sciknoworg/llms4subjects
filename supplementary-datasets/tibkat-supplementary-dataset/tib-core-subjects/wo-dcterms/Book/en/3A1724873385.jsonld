            "abstract": ".8 million. However, there has been no significant increase in Kabil in employment, and in fact a decrease in formality. Based on qualitative interviews in Batam, this expected. The investment resulted in the employment of many high-paid workers, as Ecogreen hired mostly skilled labor with college degrees in the natural sciences. These workers generally migrated from outside of Batam to join Ecogreen, thus boosting the local economy through additional demand for products and services from local enterprises. As expenditures per capita is a measure of the welfare of the local economy, this increase is expected. However, employment did not increase faster than the control group, possibly demonstrating that existing local businesses grew, and this growth was not spread to additional businesses and additional employment. Additionally, employment rates in Batam have historically been high (90-95 percent) given that it is a Special Economic Zone, so increases are not likely to be large and therefore difficult to observe in the data. Finally, formality actually decreased, likely because much of the job growth in the local economy was in the informal sector. This evaluation demonstrates that investments in skilled labor can have positive spillover effects to the local economy. It also represents the first time the IFC has used econometric methods and survey data to understand induced impact. This evaluation therefore also provides a methodological example for how the IFC can evaluate its impact in the future",

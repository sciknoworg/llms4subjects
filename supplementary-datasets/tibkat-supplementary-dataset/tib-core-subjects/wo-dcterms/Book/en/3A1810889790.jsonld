            "title": "Insurance market integration in the European Union",
            "abstract": "\"This book offers an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of insurance market integration and measures the degree of this integration. It examines the operation of the EU single financial market and against this backdrop, the regulation relating to the insurance market; the specificity and determinants of international insurance market development and the issues with assimilation, set against other financial market segments, such as the money market, credit-deposit market and bond and equity market. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of insurance market integration on an international scale. The authors propose a unique approach to the subject, in the context of the EU, and particularly in relation to the Euro area. They also apply the new measures of insurance market integration in the EU in practice, through the use of statistical data and implementation of econometric modeling. Further, they investigate how the financial and fiscal crisis has affected the insurance market in EU countries and the impact of European Central Bank monetary policy on the degree of integration in the euro area, during and after the financial crisis. The book will find an audience among academics and researchers in the fields of international economics and finance, applied, financial and growth economics\"--",

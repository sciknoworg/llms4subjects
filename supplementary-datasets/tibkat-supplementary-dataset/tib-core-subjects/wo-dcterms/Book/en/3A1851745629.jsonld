            "abstract": "Microbes and Microbial Biotechnology for Green Remediation provides a comprehensive account of sustainable microbial treatment technologies. The research presented highlights the significantly important microbial species involved in remediation, the mechanisms of remediation by various microbes, and suggestions for future improvement of bioremediation technology. The introduction of contaminants, due to rapid urbanization and anthropogenic activities, into the environment causes unsteadiness and distress to the physicochemical systems, including living organisms. Hence, there is an immediate global demand for the diminution of such contaminants and xenobiotics which can otherwise adversely affect the living organisms. Over time, microbial remediation processes have been accelerated to produce better, eco-friendlier, and more biodegradable products for complete dissemination of these xenobiotic compounds. The advancements in microbiology and biotechnology lead to the launch of microbial biotechnology as a separate area of research and contributed dramatically to the development of the areas such as agriculture, environment, biopharmaceutics, and fermented foods. Microbes stand as an imperative, efficient, green, and economical alternative to conventional treatment technologies. The proposed book provides cost-effective and sustainable alternatives. This book serves as a reference for graduate and postgraduate students in environmental biotechnology and microbiology as well as researchers and scientists working in the laboratories and industries involved in research related to microbiology, environmental biotechnology, and allied research",

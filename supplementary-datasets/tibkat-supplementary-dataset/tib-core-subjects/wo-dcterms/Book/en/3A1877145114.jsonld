                "This open access book constitutes papers from the research workshops presented at XP 2022 and XP 2023, respectively the 23rd and 24th International Conferences on Agile Software Development, held on June 13-17, 2022 at the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark and June 13-16, 2023 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. XP is the premier agile software development conference combining research and practice. It is a unique forum where agile researchers, practitioners, thought leaders, coaches, and trainers get together to present and discuss their most recent innovations, research results, experiences, concerns, challenges, and trends. XP conferences provide an informal environment to learn and trigger discussions and welcome both people new to agile and seasoned agile practitioners. In 2022, the following workshops took place: \u25cf 3rd International Workshop on Agility with Microservices Programming \u25cf 2nd International Workshop on Agile Sustainability \u25cf Agile and Education In 2023, six workshops were held: \u25cf Workshop on Organisational Debt and Large-Scale Agile \u25cf Workshop on Software-Intensive Business \u25cf Workshop on Global and Hybrid Work \u25cf Workshop on Fear-Based Agile Transformation \u25cf Workshop on AI-assisted Agile \u25cf Workshop on Agile-Quantum Software Engineering In 2022, 6 workshop papers were accepted for publication in these post-proceedings, out of 11 submissions, and in 2023, 15 papers were accepted for publication out of 38 submissions.",

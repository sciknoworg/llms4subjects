Numerous charts clearly present the costs, benefits, and trade-offs between both commercial and user-converted models.Key features include:. Estimating motor-performance for wind, hill, and cruising power requirements. Estimating battery capacity and a thorough description of battery charging. Motor and motor-control options. Evaluating motor-to-wheel coupling options. Placement of propulsion components. Configurations and performance. How systems-engineering techniques can produce electric-bicycle designs that have long travel range and low life-cycle cost. Testing.

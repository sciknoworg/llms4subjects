The scientist-writer, Narrator of the monologues, becomes a musical storyteller that makes up stories through the languages of his time, and the 'scientific word' ends up \"exorcising the evil of history and the weight of existence\" in order to soften and redeem them, placing them within the range of knowledge and expression without which, quoting the Shakespearean lines recited at the end of Revealing Ravel, man is \"fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils. / The motions of his spirit are dull as night, / and his affections dark as Erebus\".

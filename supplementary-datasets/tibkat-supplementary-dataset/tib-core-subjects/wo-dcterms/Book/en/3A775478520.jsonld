                "This book is intended for the engineer or engineering student with little or no prior background in reliability. Its purpose is to provide the background material and guidance necessary to comprehend and carry out all the tasks associated with a reliability program from specification generation to final demonstration of reliability achieved. Most available texts on reliability concentrate on the mathematics and statistics used for reliability analysis, evaluation, and demonstration. They are more often suited more for the professional with a heavier mathematical background that most engineers have, and more often than not, ignore or pay short-shrift to basic engineering design and organizational efforts associated with a reliability program. A reliability engineer must be familiar with both the mathematics and engineering aspects of a reliability program. This text: 1. Describes the mathematics needed for reliability analysis, evaluation, and demonstration commensurate with an engineer's background. 2. Provides background material, guidance, and references necessary to the structure and implementation of a reliability program including: \u2022 identification of the reliability standards in most common use \u2022 how to generate and respond to a reliability specification \u2022 how reliability can be increased \u2022 the tasks which make up a reliability program and how to judge the need and scope of each; how each is commonly performed; caution and comments about their application.",

            "abstract": "This publication is based on 'Pandemic Objects', an editorial project that compiled and reflected on objects that took on new meaning and purpose during the Covid-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, a host of everyday often-overlooked ?objects? were suddenly charged with new urgency. Toilet paper became a symbol of public panic, a forehead thermometer a tool for social control, convention centres became hospitals, while parks became contested public commodities. By compiling these objects and reflecting on their changing purpose and meaning, the project aims to paint a unique picture of the pandemic and the pivotal role objects played within it",

                "\u201cPublic-Nonprofit Collaboration and Policy in Homeless Services offers invaluable insights into the nature and workings of homelessness networks across the United States. The authors build their chapters from extensive literature sources in several academic disciplines. The chapters on the challenges on collaboratively leading networks, cross-sector medical services, and measuring effectiveness provide particularly important and useful contributions to knowledge for scholars and practitioners.\u201d \u2014J. Steven Ott, PhD. Professor Emeritus, University of Utah, USA \u201cThis book provides a novel and timely examination of multi-sector collaboration in addressing the needs of people experiencing homelessness. Both students and practicing professionals will benefit from the authors\u2019 critical analysis of relevant theories and practices for designing, governing, and managing collaborative solutions. The book\u2019s coverage of health services for homeless populations is an especially valuable resource for the social, medical, and public health fields.\u201d \u2014Glen P. Mays, PhD. Professor, University of Colorado Denver, USA This book offers a comprehensive understanding of public-nonprofit collaboration in a homeless policy field and management strategies to lead and assess cross-sector arrangements. The book demonstrates how the federal policy intention is realized through the local homeless service networks, known as Continuums of Care (CoCs) programs. It leverages unique, original, and national data and applies collaborative governance theory to develop a systematic understanding of public service networks and leadership, health care services for those experiencing homelessness, and measuring impact of collaborative activities.

            "abstract": "PV power plant integration into the grid has been a relevant topic of interest over the last years. Policies supported by governments, technology maturity, favorable incentives, and cost decreasing have significantly promoted the integration of PV power plants into power systems at the transmission and distribution levels. Nevertheless, some barriers remain in terms of forecasting generation, grid reliability, and power quality, which must be overcome for the massive PV integration into future power systems. Additionally, the ancillary services provided by these generation units are increasingly required by different agents to facilitate grid operation under a high proportion of renewables. Topics of interest for this Special Issue include the following areas: large-scale PV power plants, energy policies related to PV power plants, grid integration and interaction, PV power plant modeling, monitoring and case studies, communication systems for PV power plants integration, economic analyses, PV inverters and sizing analyses, new trends in PV technologies, and reviews",

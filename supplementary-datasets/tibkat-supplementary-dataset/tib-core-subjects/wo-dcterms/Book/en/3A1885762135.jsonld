            "abstract": "This collection of essays reprints previously published writings about Trinity College Cambridge's most celebrated writer, Lord Byron, for the bicentennial commemoration of his death on 19 April 1824. Bringing together diverse contributions from a series of scholars, three of them fellows of Trinity College, it explores various aspects of Byron\u2019s life and writing. The collection draws out the relationships between \u2018memorials, marbles and ruins\u2019, themes always prominent in his thinking and feeling.   The earliest essay reprinted here dates from the bicentenary of Byron\u2019s birth in 1788. Thirty-six years and two centuries later, this collection honours a figure of enduring, complex significance, with whom Trinity College is proud to be associated. It will be of value to scholars and students of Byron, as well as those interested in his life, in the bi-centenary year of his death",

Scientific meetings held by these organizations gleaned specific experiences of the academic community as well as clinical experiences of the most renowned experts in the field of dentistry. The editors are especially proud of bringing together leading biologists and dentists of all specialties. This unique collection of reports on the achievements and experiences of experts from all over the world represents the current spectrum of possibilities in tissue engineering of substitutes not only in dentistry but also in medicine. This book has been produced and distributed with the support from The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine",

ITS technologies have improved the safety and mobility of the transportation network through advanced applications such as electronic toll collection, in-vehicle navigation systems, collision avoidance systems, and advanced traffic management systems, and advanced traveler information systems. In this book that focuses on different ITS technologies and applications, authors from several countries have contributed chapters covering different ITS technologies, applications, and management practices with the expectation that the open exchange of scientific results and ideas presented in this book will lead to improved understanding of ITS technologies and their applications",

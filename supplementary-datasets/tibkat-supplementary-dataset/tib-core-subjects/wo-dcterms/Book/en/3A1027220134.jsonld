            "abstract": "\"A treatment of 15 topics of great contemporary relevance by bestselling author S. A. Abbasi. Each topic is covered from its basics to its global application in a highly concise and compact yet exceedingly clear and lucid style. The coverage has a wide sweep, reflective of the great diversity and complexity of challenges presently faced by the Earth's environment. Some of the biggest existence-threatening questions are also addressed in this book - for example: Is renewable energy as safe for the world as is believed? Can technology make the present paradigm of development sustainable? Will a shift to renewables halt global warming? Is fossil fuel decarburization really workable? Current Concerns in Environmental Engineering would enhance the comprehension of undergraduate and graduate students while giving them a worldview that formal textbooks generally fail to do. The book will be exceedingly useful to teachers and researchers due to the fresh insights it can give and the innovative thinking it can stimulate. The book is profusely illustrated with dramatic as well as aesthetically pleasing visuals. Besides capturing the interest of the reader the visuals also enhance the reader's comprehension and appreciation of the text\"--",

                "It\u2019s a jungle out there. Delivering software solutions with predictable costs, time, scope, and quality has become more complicated than ever. Developers need to account for multiple moving targets, including often avoided but always relevant factors such as culture, people, and leadership. To effectively deal with these challenges, it\u2019s necessary to rethink the entire delivery chain of modern software development. This book addresses all these topics, putting everything in perspective, from the potential awkwardness created by cultural differences to connecting code with business outcomes to make delivering quality solutions possible. As a software engineer who strives to be his best and challenge the status quo when building IT systems, author Tengiz Tutisani always wanted a book that would cover all of these elements from a developer\u2019s perspective \u2014 so he wrote one. Effective Software Development for the Enterprise builds on advanced disciplines, methodologies, and techniques derived from domain-driven design, software architecture, and extreme programming. Its objective is to aid modern software engineers and solution architects in building and delivering high-quality solutions for an enterprise while meeting ambitious criteria: Meet users' expectations Deliver solutions on time with no defects Create products that can scale-out horizontally Solutions should not require a dedicated production support team Accelerate development pace Double ROI per developer, team, and software You will learn how to achieve these objectives in any engineering environment by developing solid strategies based on the industry's well-known, recognized, and proven patterns and principles. After reading this book, you will be ready to effectively deal with any and all challenges posed by today\u2019s hyper-competitive, globally-diverse, fast-moving enterprise environment."

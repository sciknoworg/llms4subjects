Colvin -- The organisational ombuds : implications for voice, conflict resolution and fairness at work / Sue Fernie, David Metcalf -- Introduction / David Lewin, Bruce E. Kaufman. - Advances in Industrial and Labor Relations (AILR) continues to receive high quality submitted manuscripts and to publish the best among these, as determined by double blind anonymous refereeing. Volume 13 of AILR contains eight papers dealing, respectively, with European responses to high unemployment rates; the effects of alternative types of staffing arrangements; the adoption and use of alternative dispute resolution procedures in the nonunion workplace; the implications of organizational ombuds arrangements for voice, conflict resolution and fairness at work; building and sustaining labor-management partnerships; union and employer tactics in Ontario, Canada organizing campaigns; the late 20th century campaign for U.S. striker replacement legislation; and the development over a quarter-century of Australian industrial relations thought. It is no accident that the research settings for the papers contained in this volume include North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. AILR has long encouraged manuscript submissions from researchers worldwide, and seeks to publish articles that expand theoretical and empirical industrial relations knowledge beyond that obtained from U.S. settings and data sources. Taken as a set, the eight papers contained in Volume 13 of AILR clearly reflect achievement of this objective",

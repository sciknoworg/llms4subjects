                "This book offers a coherent theoretical and multimodal perspective on research, teaching and learning in different non-formal, semi-formal, and formal learning environments. Drawing on examples across a range of different settings, the book provides a conceptual framework for research on learning in different environments. It provides conceptual models around learning design which act as a framework for how to think about contemporary learning, a guideline for how to do research on learning in different sites, and a tool for innovative, collaborative design with other professionals. The book highlights concepts like multimodal knowledge representations; framing and setting; transformation, transduction, and re-design; signs of learning and cultures of recognition in different social contexts. The book supports innovative thinking on how we understand learning, and will appeal to academics, scholars and postgraduate students in the fields of education research and theory, learning sciences, and multimodal and social semiotics. It will also be of interest to school leaders, university provosts and professionals working in education.",

Designs in and for learning - a theoretical framework Staffan Selander Introduction A detour on \"basic knowledge\" Design as a dynamic perspective Designs for learning - Designs in learning Framing Setting Re-design - the transforming and forming processes Knowledge representations Signs of learning Learning Design Sequences Concluding remarks on Designs for Learning References Chapter 2. Designs in learning and rhizomatic webs *Fredrik Lindstrand & Staffan Selander Introduction Rhizomatic webs as a metaphor for learning Multimodal knowledge representations Epistemological commitments Re-design by way of transformation and transduction Making film in schools - a case study Searching for a shared interest Writing a synopsis Storyboard Conclusion References Chapter 3. A semiotic and design-oriented approach to affordance Fredrik Lindstrand Drawing a dinosaur A focus on resources Affordance What the environment offers Affordance as a relational notion Agency and acts of distinction Semiotic potential and meaning potential Beyond things: semiotic and modal affordances The social affordances of discourses Another level - institutions and their rituals Conclusion References Chapter 4. Design and research: Ethical considerations Anna \u00c5kerfeldt and Lisa Bj\u00f6rklund Boistrup Introduction The setting Formal ethical protocols - an obstacle or a necessity? *Ethical protocols and participants in the research Capturing the institutional setting of the participants' context *Transformation units Professionals' and researchers' roles Principles for roles in research where participants are taken as partners Collaboration with professionals *Discussion References Chapter 5. Designing and researching vocational mathematics education Lisa Bj\u00f6rklund Boistrup & Matilda H\u00e4llback Introduction Other frameworks in the literature The context of the chapter Designing teaching Theoretical and practical aspects of knowledge: Praxeology A framework for the analysis of collaborative teaching A revised version of the Learning Design Sequence. Four examples from the makeup lesson One example from the hair styling lesson. Conclusions References Chapter 6. Design workshops to develop a digital educator's tool Susanne Kj\u00e4llander Introduction Aim and research question Digital tools to support children's learning and teacher's profession Workshop as a research method Designs for learning and the Learning Design Sequences Methodological and ethical considerations Design of the workshop series Design of the workshops - analysis and results WS1 - empirical example WS2 - empirical example WS3 - empirical example WS4 - empirical example WS5 - empirical example Concluding discussion *Final remarks on the methodology References Chapter 7. Sites for learning and knowledge representations - the Middle Ages Eva Insulander, Fredrik Lindstrand & Staffan Selander The Middle Ages in our (European) society The ubiquity of the Middle Ages in our late-modern society Gaming the Middle Ages - examples of Designs for Learning in non-formal settings Learning about the Middle Ages The Middle Ages in museums - examples of Designs for Learning in a semi-formal setting The Middle Ages in schools - examples of Designs for Learning in a formal setting *Concluding remarks References *Chapter 8.

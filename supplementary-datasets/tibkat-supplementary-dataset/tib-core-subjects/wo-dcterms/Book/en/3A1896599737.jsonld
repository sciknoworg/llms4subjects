                "This detailed volume presents methodologies for studying reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism in plant cells, including techniques for detecting different types of ROS such as superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide or singlet oxygen, as well as ROS generating systems such as xanthine oxidoreductase. The book provides alternatives to determine malondialdehyde, electrochemical detection approaches for determining total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as well as enzymatic antioxidants, as well as methods for studying non-enzymatic antioxidants and some components of the secondary metabolism. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, the chapters in this book provide the kind of detailed implementation advice that leads to ideal results in the laboratory. Authoritative and practical, ROS Signaling in Plants: Methods and Protocols serves as an ideal guide for scientists interested in the metabolism of ROS in plant cells."

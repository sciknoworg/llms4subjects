            "abstract": "\"This textbook introduces logistics from a broad perspective to include all activities throughout the product and service life cycle pertaining to supply chain and logistics management, the physical supply and distribution of products, and the corresponding maintenance and support. It recognizes the mutual interdependence of the major functional areas of the organization including marketing, production, and finance. The emphasis throughout the text is on logistics in the context of a total business system design process. It views the business as a \"system\", managing logistics within that system, and thus transforming their Supply Chain. Pedagogy to aid learning is incorporated throughout every chapter, with chapter objectives, case studies, and concept checks. This text is intended for both upper-level undergraduate and lower-level graduate students in both Business and Engineering on logistics and supply chain tracks. It can also serve as a reference for practitioners actively engaged in day-to-day management of logistics and supply chain activities. Supplementary online resources include an instructors' manual, chapter-by-chapter PowerPoint slides, glossary, and a test bank of exam questions\"--",

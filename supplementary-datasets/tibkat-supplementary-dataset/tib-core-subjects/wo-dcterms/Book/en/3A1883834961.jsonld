            "abstract": "\"The FAO has estimated that the global human population will reach approximately 9 billion by the year 2050. To meet the increasing demand, the worlds farming system will need to produce 50% more food than currently in production. The problem is further aggravated by narrow genetic makeup of cultivated crops, application of classical breeding approaches, less investment in cutting edge techniques coupled with biotic and abiotic factors under global climate change. Plant breeding based technologies have contributed significantly to hunger reduction in recent decades. However, the global food requirements can't be meet through conventional breeding methods. The recent crop improvement efforts are targeting novel plant breeding approaches based on OMICs technologies i.e., phenomics, proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics etc. along with genome editing for important traits. The OMICs based high-throughput approaches provide vast information on genes, protein and metabolites, further analyzed through statistical methods to create crop varieties via elucidating metabolic and biological systems response for various biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, the screening of large germplasm pools for identification of novel alleles can be accelerated with OMICs based technologies ultimately enhancing the availability of variation for breeding. Omics based approaches have also helped develop new metabolically engineered crop plants with desirable agronomic traits and has facilitated de novo domestication of new crops for sustainable agriculture and food security. In addition to OMICs the discovery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system by Jennifer Doudna and her colleague Emmanuelle Charpentier for targeted genome editing has provided a new tool to scientists and revolutionized genome editing with greater flexibility, precision and efficiency to edit genes of interest. This technique is as a game-changer in plant engineering as it causes genome editing similar to natural mutations. The CRISPR system has been successfully employed in several agricultural important crops e.g., Oryza sativa, Zea Mays, Triticum aestivum, Solanum tuberosum etc. for improving yield, quality, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, and climate resilient crops. These achievements were possible due to precise prediction of causal genes and metabolic pathways achieved by interpretation of data generated through OMICs based approaches. In addition, the CRISPR based system is evolving further and enabling researchers to exploit its advance versions like base and prime editing to modify domesticated traits as per the current needs of human beings\"--",

            "abstract": "Modelling and computations in electromagnetics is a quite fast-growing research area. The recent interest in this field is caused by the increased demand for designing complex microwave components, modeling electromagnetic materials, and rapid increase in computational power for calculation of complex electromagnetic problems. The first part of this book is devoted to the advances in the analysis techniques such as method of moments, finite-difference time- domain method, boundary perturbation theory, Fourier analysis, mode-matching method, and analysis based on circuit theory. These techniques are considered with regard to several challenging technological applications such as those related to electrically large devices, scattering in layered structures, photonic crystals, and artificial materials. The second part of the book deals with waveguides, transmission lines and transitions. This includes microstrip lines (MSL), slot waveguides, substrate integrated waveguides (SIW), vertical transmission lines in multilayer media as well as MSL to SIW and MSL to slot line transitions",

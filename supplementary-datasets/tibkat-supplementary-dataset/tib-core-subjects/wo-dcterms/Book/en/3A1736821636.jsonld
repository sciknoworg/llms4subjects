                "\"Algal and sustainable technologies: Bioenergy, Nannotechnology and Green chemistry is an interdisciplinary overview of the world's major problems; water scarcity, clean environment and energy and their sustenance remedy measures using microalgae. It comprehensively presents the way to tackle the socio-economic issues including food, feed, fuel, medicine and health and also entails the untapped potential of microalgae in environmental management, bioenergy solution and sustainable synthesis of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products. This book basically emphasizes the success of algae as wonderful feed stocks of future and provides upto date information and sustainable and recreational outlook towards degrading environment and energy crisis. Applicability of fast emerging algae based nanotechnology in bioremediation and production of nanoparticle (AuNP, AgNP etc) are beautifully described along with latest research and findings. Key features: The \"waste to best to income\" strategies are the main concern of the book and take the edge off the problem of pollution, energy and income. Elucidate the sustainable phycoremediation and nanoparticle functions as low cost approach for various ecosystem services. Information regarding pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and other algae based value added product synthesis and fate are comprehensively discussed. Knowledge resource, latest research, findings and prospects presented in an accessible manner for researchers, students, eminent scientists, entrepreneurs, professionals and policy maker\"--",

            "abstract": "For the volume \"Klasse 6b. Eine Unterrichtswoche\" (Class 6b. A week of lessons), a 6th grade class was followed with a camera over the course of a week ... in an attempt to capture the complexity of everyday classroom life and turn what was observed into a case from different perspectives. Looking beyond individual pupils, individual teachers or individual subjects is an innovative aspect of the volume. The twelve filmed lessons have been analyzed from the perspective of the respective subject didactics as well as various perspectives of educational science. Multi-perspectivity in the observation of lessons thus inevitably takes center stage and is explicitly desired. In addition, this approach also illustrates the heterogeneity of perspectives that student teachers also encounter in their studies, for example, when they encounter courses with different lecturers from at least two subjects and the field of educational science over the course of the week. With a few exceptions, all of the authors are researchers and employees at the Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen. Their different analyses also stand for different logics of observation, which perhaps only become clear in contrast to each other. The volume is aimed at all those involved in teacher training: teachers at schools, teacher trainers, student teachers, trainee teachers and the academic community",

            "abstract": "The coup in Myanmar on 1 February 2021 abruptly reversed a                    decade-long flirtation with economic and political freedoms. The country has                    since descended into civil war, the people have been plunged back into conflict                    and poverty, and the state is again characterised by fragility and human                    insecurity. As the Myanmar people oppose the regime and fight for their rights,                    the international community must find ways to act in solidarity. There is an                    urgent need for new policy settings and for practical engagement with local                    partners and recipient groups. The contributors to After the Coup offer timely                    insights into ways international actors can try to reduce the suffering of                    millions of citizens who are again being held hostage by a brutal and                    self-serving regime. Chapters analyse topics including coercive statecraft,                    international justice, Rakhine State (Rohingya) dynamics, pandemic                    weaponisation, higher education, non-state welfare and aid delivery, activism                    from exile, self-determination and power sharing in the National Unity                    Government's alternative constitution, and the roles of China and the                    Association of Southeast Asian Nations",

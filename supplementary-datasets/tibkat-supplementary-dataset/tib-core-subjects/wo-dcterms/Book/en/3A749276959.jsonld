                "We have reached the double conclusion: that invention is choice, that this choice is imperatively governed by the sense of scientific beauty. Hadamard (1945), Princeton University Press, by permission. The great majority of all sources and amplifiers of microwave energy, and all devices for receiving or detecting microwaves, use a semiconductor active element. The development of microwave semiconductor devices, de\u00ad scribed in this book, has proceeded from the simpler, two-terminal, devices such as GUNN or IMPATT devices, which originated in the 1960s, to the sophisticated monolithic circuit MESFET three-terminal active elements, of the 1980s and 1990s. The microwave field has experienced a renais\u00ad sance in electrical engineering departments in the last few years, and much of this growth has been associated with microwave semiconductor devices. The University of Massachusetts has recently developed a well recognized program in microwave engineering. Much of the momentum for this pro\u00ad gram has been provided by interaction with industrial companies, and the influx of a large number of industry-supported students. This program had a need for a course in microwave semiconductor devices, which covered the physical aspects, as well as the aspects of interest to the engineer who incorporates such devices in his designs. It was also felt that it would be im\u00ad portant to introduce the most recently developed devices (HFETs, HBTs, and other advanced devices) as early as possible."

            "abstract": "Taiwan a typical small Asian country with few energy resources is well known for its high-tech industry in the last 20 years. However as a member of the global village Taiwan feels the responsibility to reduce carbon emissions. The book tells you how Taiwan transforms itself from a high-tech island to become a low carbon island. The book address Taiwan's low-carbon developmental policies of the past 10 years, applies an econometric approach to estimate Taiwan's sector department CO2 emissions, shows how environmental change affects the economic growth of Taiwan, and provides two successful examples of low-carbon pilot regions in Taiwan. Stephen Shen, the Minister of the Environment Protection Agency of Taiwan, believes that the book arrives at the right time, because this is the time to educate the people of Taiwan, about the necessary action for achieving a low carbon society",

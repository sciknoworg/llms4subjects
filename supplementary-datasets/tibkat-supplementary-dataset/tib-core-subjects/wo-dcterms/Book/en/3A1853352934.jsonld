            "abstract": "Milk and meat products originating from small ruminants contain biologically active compounds, such as high-quality proteins, vitamins, minerals and fatty acids that have been proven to have beneficial effects on human nutrition, metabolism and health. However, the raising consumer demands for safe animal products of high nutritional value has reshaped the direction of livestock production and food industry. Currently, research efforts are focused on the development of niche functional products that fortify human health and are in harmony with the concept of sustainable production, green economy, environmental protection, and proper health and welfare status of farm animals. Innovative feeding strategies are therefore evaluated that could promote ruminal function, enhance animal health and welfare status, increase production yield, improve quality of milk and meat products and prolong their shelf life by minimizing environmental burden and production costs",

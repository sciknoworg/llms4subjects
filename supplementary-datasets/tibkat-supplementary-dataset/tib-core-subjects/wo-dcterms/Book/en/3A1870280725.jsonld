            "abstract": "\"Analysis and Compensation of Kinetic Friction in Robotic and Mechatronic Control Systems comprehensively covers the theory behind kinetic friction, as well as compensation methods and practical solutions, and serves as a key companion to studying different control systems. Beginning with a clear introduction to the subject, the book goes on to include three main facets of kinetic friction, starting with phenomena of kinetic friction in drives. Following on from this, the book examines motion dynamics with friction, which introduces dynamic system equations and focuses on both energy balance and dissipation. Finally, it explains compensation of friction in motion control, which summarises key compensation methods in controlled mechanical systems. Introducing various basic feedback control methods, including observer-based methods to compensate for kinetic friction, the book provides practical information which can be used in a wide variety of contexts not specific to particular systems or applications. The book will be of interest to students and industry workers in the field of robotics, mechanical systems and control engineering\"",

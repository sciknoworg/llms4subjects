In the successful group, have a few\u2014notably China\u2014enhanced methods long used by European imperialists to extract national resources from weaker countries? Has solidarity among poor countries ended? What does the future hold for poor countries? For compelling answers to these questions, read Colburn\u2019s Colonialism, Independence, and the Construction of Nation-States.\u2019 \u2013 Lynn T. White III, Professor, Princeton University, New Jersey, USA \u2018Colburn\u2019s Colonialism, Independence, and the Construction of Nation-States is both an enlightening and enjoyable read. It is wide-ranging yet enlivened by telling examples.\u2019 \u2013 Michael Doyle, Professor, Columbia University, New York, USA \u2018Forrest Colburn\u2019s Colonialism, Independence, and the Construction of Nation-States is in part, and most significantly, a welcome attempt to revisit the history of basic ideas from the past, that should not have been shelved. Development, Third World, colonialism, North-South, are notions that surfaced in the sixties and seventies, and faded under the influence of excessive enthusiasm for \u201cemerging markets\u201d in the new century. Colburn explains splendidly why the history of these notions, and their content, is more relevant than ever.\u2019 \u2013 Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, Former Foreign Minister of Mexico, and Professor, New York University, New York, USA This book analyzes how the poorer countries of the world have a shared history: these many countries were assaulted, overrun, and sometimes even formed by European colonialism. The wave of accessions to legal independence in the aftermath of World War II was of extraordinary importance. There was an intoxicating confidence and determination, a sense that everything was possible. A half-century later, the world looks different. The author adroitly delineates the uneven performance of newly-constructed or reimagined nation-states, and the shifting perceptions of the poorer countries in the world. Forrest D. Colburn is a Professor at the City University of New York, New York, USA.",

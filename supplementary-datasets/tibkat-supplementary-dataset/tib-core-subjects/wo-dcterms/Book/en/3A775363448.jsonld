            "abstract": [
                "This volume collects papers dedicated to Jerry Ericksen on his sixtieth birthday, December 20, 1984. They first appeared in Volumes 82-90 (1983-1985) of the Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis. At the request of the Editors the list of authors to be invited was drawn up by C. M. Dafermos, D. D. Joseph, and F. M. Leslie. The breadth and depth of the works here reprinted reflect the corresponding qualities in Jerry Ericksen's research, teaching, scholarship, and inspiration. His interests and expertness center upon the mechanics of materials and extend to everything that may contribute to it: pure analysis, algebra, geometry, through all aspects of theoretical mechanics to fundamental experiment, all of these illumi\u00ad nated by an intimate and deep familiarity with the sources, even very old ones. He is independent of school and contemptuous of party spirit; his generosity in giving away his ideas is renowned, but not everyone is capable of accepting what is offered. His writings are totally free of broad claims and attributions beyond his own study. Some are decisive, some are prophetic, and all are forthright. His work has served as a beacon of insight and simple honesty in an age of ever more trivial and corrupt science. The authors of the memoirs in this volume are his students, colleagues, admirers, and (above all) his friends.",

            "abstract": "This report makes several contributions to the literature on the welfare of FDPs and their hosts. On the data front, the harmonized database compiled for this report represents a large and unique source of information on the welfare of both hosts and FDPs during the period of an unprecedented pandemic. The data span 14 countries from different regions, populations of concern (IDPs, refugees, hosts), and accommodation types (in camps, out of camps). Over a fifth of the global population displaced before the start of the pandemic is represented in this database, allowing for direct comparison and aggregation of results across countries and subgroups. The report also brings a policy lens to the analysis. By examining the role of existing labor market and education policies in the hosting country using newly available information from a cross country, up-to-date policy database, the data yield important insights. In addition, the report examinesaid financing trends using disbursement-level data from OECD's Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and a labor-intensive keyword search approach to teaseout disbursements that are intended for displaced populations. The rest of the report is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in this exercise, including the samples, the harmonization process, and the resulting database. Section 3 presents the key results on the welfare impact of the forcibly displaced and their hosts during the pandemic and ensuing crises. Where relevant and possible, theresults are linked to preexisting sectoral polices that were in place in hosting countries before the pandemic. Section 4 discusses the recent trend in official development assistance (ODA) intended for displaced populations. The report concludes with adiscussion of the results and a set of forward-looking policy recommendations, focusing on inclusive social policies and sustainable financing aimedat promoting self-reliance among the displaced, and on lessons learned for data collection and harmonization following this unprecedented endeavor",

            "abstract": "This volume addresses the nature of the most common form of arthritis in humans. If osteoarthritis is inevitable (only premature death prevents all of us from being afflicted), it seems essential to facilitate its recognition, prevention, options, and indications for treatment. Progress in understanding this disease has occurred with recognition that it is not simply a degenerative joint disease. Causative factors, such as joint malalignment, ligamentous abnormalities, overuse, and biomechanical and metabolic factors have been recognized as amenable to intervention; genetic factors, less so; with metabolic diseases, intermediate. Its diagnosis is based on recognition of overgrowth of bone at joint margins. This contrasts with overgrowth of bone at vertebral margins, which is not a symptomatic phenomenon and has been renamed spondylosis deformans. Osteoarthritis describes an abnormality of joints, but the severity does not necessarily produce pain. The patient and his/her symptoms need to be treated, not the x-ray",

            "abstract": "This book is a treasure trove comprising core writings from Hans Walter Gabler\u2018s seminal work on James Joyce, spanning fifty years from the analysis of composition he undertook towards a critical text of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, through the Critical and Synoptic Edition of Ulysses, to Gabler\u2018s latest essays on (appropriately enough) Joyce\u2019s sustained artistic innovation.   Not only does this span of essays trace the evolution of Gabler\u2019s thinking about Joyce\u2019s originality and creative energy. It also reflects the development and maturation of Gabler\u2018s own genetic criticism and his methodology of genetic editing, which grows in depth and complexity across the collection. The reader will explore Joyce\u2019s life and works through Gabler\u2019s incisive eye, while also examining a progress of his reflections on his edition of Ulysses and the past controversy that beset it.  This classic compendium combining well-seasoned scholarship and fresh criticism is an essential read for critics of Modernism, digital humanists, scholars and students of James Joyce, and anyone interested in the art of literary analysis",

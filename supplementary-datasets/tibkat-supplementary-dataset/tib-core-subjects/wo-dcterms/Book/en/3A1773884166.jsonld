                "For historical and socio-economic reasons, the countries of the southern Black Sea region are facing mounting and apparently intractable problems in managing their solid waste, with increasingly serious implications for public health and quality of life, as well as the wider socio-economic development of the region. Hitherto, no comprehensive, systematic study of the problem seems to have been conducted, to determine the underlying causes and suggesting how it might be alleviated in socially and economically viable ways, aiming at sustainability. The present book analyzes the causes of the poor state of solid waste management in the region, identifying feasible modalities with which at least a degree of sustainability could be achieved in the management of the region's solid waste. Readership: Environmental managers, scientists, planners, policy makers, technical and investment consultants, businesses and other enterprises and institutions concerned with sustainable solid waste management in the region."

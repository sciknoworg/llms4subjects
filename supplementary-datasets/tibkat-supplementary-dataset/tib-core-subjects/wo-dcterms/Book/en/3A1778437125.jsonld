            "abstract": "The use of the energy and its resources have changed dramatically in last few decades. The increasing use of technology and electrification increases the demand for energy, with impacts natural energy resources. At present, industries are trying to reduce the direct use of traditional energy by utilizing renewable energy as an alternative energy resource. Recent studies have attempted to optimize consumed energies for entire systems by using alternative energies. These alternatives are different kinds of renewable energies which provide numerous new possibilities to survive without using non-renewable energies. The production industry is moving toward smart production using the technology of the fourth industrial revolution. In this book, energy consumption for production and supply chain management are explained through presentation of some the latest major research advances. These studies collectively contribute new ideas and strategies in enriching the literature",

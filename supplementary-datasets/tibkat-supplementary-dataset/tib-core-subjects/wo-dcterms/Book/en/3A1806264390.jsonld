            "abstract": "For working people, the expenses of going to their jobs, in terms of time and cost, are a crucial aspect of daily life. As economic conditions and mobility systems changed in the twentieth century, this aspect of workers\u2019 lives underwent significant transformations. Historians have only begun to unravel how power and social inequality informed the governance of everyday mobility. Amid the turmoil of twentieth century economic booms and busts, war and austerity, and processes of (car-centered) suburbanization, how did low-income, rural, and migrant workers get to work in the Netherlands? Governing Workers\u2019 Mobility explores the political choices underlying workers\u2019 daily commute. Using archival collections, it uncovers the shaping role of workers and employers, detailing their understanding and response to past mobility barriers. It discusses workers\u2019 discovery of bicycles, buses, mopeds, and cars; highlights company efforts to support and control employees\u2019 mobility; and shows that today\u2019s predicaments have a longer history",

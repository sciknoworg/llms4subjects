            "abstract": "\"Handbook of Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering focuses on recent AI technologies and applications that provide some very promising solutions and enhanced technology in the biomedical field. Recent advancements in computational techniques, such as machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data, accelerate the deployment of biomedical devices in various healthcare applications. This volume explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to these expert systems by mimicking the human expert's knowledge in order to predict and monitor the health status in real time. The accuracy of the AI systems is drastically increasing by using machine learning, digitized medical data acquisition, wireless medical data communication, and computing infrastructure AI approaches, helping to solve complex issues in the biomedical industry and playing a vital role in future healthcare applications. The volume takes a multidisciplinary perspective of employing these new applications in biomedical engineering, exploring the combination of engineering principles with biological knowledge that contributes to the development of revolutionary and life-saving concepts. Topics include: Security and privacy issues in biomedical AI systems and potential solutions Healthcare applications using biomedical AI systems Machine learning in biomedical engineering Live patient monitoring systems Semantic annotation of healthcare data This book presents a broad exploration of biomedical systems using artificial intelligence techniques with detailed coverage of the applications, techniques, algorithms, platforms, and tools in biomedical AI systems. This book will benefit researchers, medical and industry practitioners, academicians, and students\"--",

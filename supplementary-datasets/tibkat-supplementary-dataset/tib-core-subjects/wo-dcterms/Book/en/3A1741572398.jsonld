                "This book presents an overview of European migration policy and the various institutional arrangements within and between various actors, such as local councils, local media, local economies, and local civil society initiatives. Both the role of local authorities in this policy field and their cooperation with civil society initiatives or networks are under-explored topics for research. In response, this book provides a range of detailed case studies focusing on the six main groups of national and administrative traditions in Europe: Germanic, Scandinavian, Napoleonic, Southeastern European, Central-Eastern European and Anglo-Saxon. Jochen Franzke is a Professor of Administrative Science at the Faculty of Economics and Social Science, University of Potsdam, Germany. His main research fields are comparative sub-national public administrative reforms and new forms of local governance and citizen participation. He is a member of the Board of the Institute of Local Government Studies (University of Potsdam) and Co-chair of the Permanent Study Group on Local Governance and Democracy at the European Group of Public Administration (EGPA). He has been a visiting scholar at several European universities. Jos\u00e9 M.

                "1.1 COMMUNICATION WHILE TRAVELLING The pace of our daily life has been increasing for several decades. Our needs have multiplied as new products have appeared and then been replaced after a few years, or even months, of existence by a more fashionable product or one of higher performance. The life cycles of the technologies used in consumer and professional electronic products are also becoming shorter. This acceleration is an inherent fact of our consumer society. and the relationship between people and machines are Lifestyles due to the multiplicity of ephemeral consumer products. Objects changing no longer have a history; they are merely tools which fulfil a predetermined function. Personal portable products are of a new type which has appeared among pens, wallets, these impersonal objects. This category includes watches, handbags, calculators, portable radios and pocket telephones. As these products for the pocket are carried on one's person, they belong in a very personal way and have, therefore, a speciftc identity corresponding to the image which they are given. In the evolution of lifestyles, the explosive increase of travel and time management are major factors. The pocket telephone is, therefore, remark\u00ad able for two reasons. It is not only an impersonal tool or product but is also very much a personal portable product. The possibility of distant com\u00ad munication while travelling, being able to call or be called at will anywhere at any time permits the pocket telephone to be often considered as a desirable, almost magic, personal item."

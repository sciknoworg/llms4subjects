                "This book offers the latest research and recommended models on the microsized cooling system, which not only significantly reduces the weight load but also enhances the capability to remove a much greater amount of heat than any large-scale cooling systems. A detailed reference to microchannel phase change (boiling and condensation) includes recommended models and correlations for various requirements such as pressure loss and heat transfer coefficient. Researchers, engineers, designers, and students will benefit from the collated, state-of-the-art research that is found in this book and its systematic addressing of the relevant issues and provision of a good reference for solving problems of critical analysis"

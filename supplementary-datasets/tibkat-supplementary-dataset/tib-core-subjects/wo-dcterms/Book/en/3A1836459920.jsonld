            "abstract": "The Me\u1e5bt\u012byo R\u0101\u1e6dho\u1e5bs of Me\u1e5bto, R\u0101jasth\u0101n is a treasure for scholars of Rajp\u016bt history. Richard D. Saran and Norman P. Ziegler, whose contributions to Rajp\u016bt studies are well known to specialists in the field, have given us a work of deep and exacting scholarship. It is the culmination of decades devoted to the study of Middle Marwari chronicles from R\u0101jasth\u0101n. The sources translated here provide access to the fortunes of a branch of the Jodhpur royal family, and in doing so they illuminate the larger world of Rajp\u016bts in the middle period. The Me\u1e5bt\u012byo R\u0101\u1e6dho\u1e5bs are significant for several reasons. Their story traces the emergence of a Rajp\u016bt brotherhood into local prominence and follows the establishment of their kingdom on the eastern edge of M\u0101rv\u0101\u1e5b as a defined territorial unit. The evolution of the Me\u1e5bt\u012byos as a brotherhood passed through several clearly defined stages, including a relationship with the house of Jodhpur that ranged from mutual support among brothers to hostility and clear separation. A study of the Me\u1e5bt\u012byos in this context provides a unique view of the formation of a strong and indpenedent Rajp\u016bt cadet line, of the establishment and defense of a local territory, and of the internal relations among Rajp\u016bt brotherhoods regarding issues of precedence, honor, patronage, and service. The translations are accompanied by an extensive explanatory apparatus taking various forms, which includes a valuable essay on Rajput social organization, complete genealogies, and biographies of all the major personages of the chronicles",

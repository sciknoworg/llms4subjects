            "abstract": "Silicon-on-Insulator Technology: Materials to VLSI, 2nd Edition describes the different facets of SOI technology. SOI chips are now commercially available and SOI wafer manufacturers have gone public. SOI has finally made it out of the academic world and is now a big concern for every major semiconductor company. SOI technology has indeed deserved serious recognition: high-temperature (400\u00b0C), extremely rad-hard (500 Mrad(Si)), high-density (16 Mb, 0.9-volt DRAM), high-speed (several GHz) and low-voltage (0.5 V) SOI circuits have been demonstrated. Strategic choices in favor of the use of SOI for low-voltage, low-power portable systems have been made by several major semiconductor manufacturers. Silicon-on-Insulator Technology: Materials to VLSI, 2nd Edition presents a complete and state-of-the-art review of SOI materials, devices and circuits. SOI fabrication and characterization techniques, SOI device processing, the physics of the SOI MOSFET as well as that of SOI other devices, and the performances of SOI circuits are discussed in detail. The SOI specialist will find this book invaluable as a source of compiled references covering the different aspects of SOI technology. For the non-specialist, the book serves as an excellent introduction to the topic with detailed, yet simple and clear explanations. Silicon-on-Insulator Technology: Materials to VLSI, 2nd Edition is recommended for use as a textbook for classes on semiconductor device processing and physics. The level of the book is appropriate for teaching at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Silicon-on-Insulator Technology: Materials to VLSI, 2nd Edition includes the new materials, devices, and circuit concepts which have been devised since the publication of the first edition. The circuit sections, in particular, have been updated to present the performances of SOI devices for low-voltage, low-power applications, as well as for high-temperature, smart-power, and DRAM applications. The other sections, such as those describing SOI materials, the physics of the SOI MOSFET and other devices have been updated to present the state of the art in SOI technology",

                "Technology plays a significant role in doctoral leadership studies providing a channel for teaching, learning, research, and administrative processes. Advancing Doctoral Leadership Education Through Technology addresses the growing need for universities to explore, revise, and develop the content and delivery of doctoral leadership education. A growing number of programs and the more recent inclusion of leadership courses within varied postgraduate disciplines illustrates the rising interest in doctoral leadership education. Advances in technology provide a vehicle to deliver content and information to a wide array of learners, therefore it is time to ask questions about the benefits, challenges and needed solutions to prepare for the future design and delivery of leadership education. This book offers valuable information for faculty and administrators responsible for developing and delivering doctoral studies through technology in order to provide access, convenience, enriched learning, and to create new pathways to achieve a doctorate. Professors working in a classroom-based, or primarily in virtual environments, or in a hybrid of both could also benefit from reading this book. Doctoral students engaged in completing their dissertations and research projects will also find a wealth of information related to higher education teaching, learning, and technology",

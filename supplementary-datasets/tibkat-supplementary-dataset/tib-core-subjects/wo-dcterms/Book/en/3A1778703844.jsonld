            "title": "Role of the Adipocyte in Development of Type 2 Diabetes",
            "abstract": "Adipocytes are important in the body for maintaining proper energy balance by storing excess energy as triglycerides. However, efforts of the last decade have identified several molecules that are secreted from adipocytes, such as leptin, which are involved in signaling between tissues and organs. These adipokines are important in overall regulation of energy metabolism and can regulate body composition as well as glucose homeostasis. Excess lipid storage in tissues other than adipose can result in development of diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this book we review the role of adipocytes in development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. Because type 2 diabetes has been suggested to be a disease of inflammation we included several chapters on the mechanism of inflammation modulating organ injury. Finally, we conclude with a review on exercise and nutrient regulation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and its co-morbidities",

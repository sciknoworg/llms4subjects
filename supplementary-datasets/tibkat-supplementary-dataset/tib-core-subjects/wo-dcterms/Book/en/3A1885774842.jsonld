Offering five distinct sections, this volume:  Familiarizes students and beginning scholars with key concepts and methodological resources guiding contemporary inquiry into children\u2019s literature Describes the major media formats and genres for texts expressly addressing children Considers the production, distribution, and valuing of children\u2019s books from an assortment of historical and contemporary perspectives, highlighting context as a driver of content Maps how children\u2019s texts have historically presumed and prescribed certain identities on the part of their readers, sometimes addressing readers who share some part of the author\u2019s identity, sometimes seeking to educate the reader about a presumed \u201cother,\u201d and in recent decades increasingly foregrounding identities once lacking visibility and voice Explores the historical evolutions and trans-regional contacts and (inter)connections in the long process of the formation of global children\u2019s literature, highlighting issues such as retranslation, transnationalism, transculturality, and new digital formats for considering cultural crossings and renegotiations in the production of children\u2019s literature Methodically presented and contextualized, this volume is an engaging introduction to this expanding and multifaceted field",

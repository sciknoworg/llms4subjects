                "This book presents an up-to-date perspective on randomized response techniques (RRT). It discusses the most appropriate and efficient procedures of RRT for analysing data from queries dealing with sensitive and confidential issues, including the treatment of infinite and finite population setups. The book aims to spark a renewed interest among sampling experts who may have overlooked RRT. By addressing the missing topics and incorporating a wide range of contributors' works, it seeks to foster an appreciative academic environment and inspire a reformed and amended view of RRT. As the book unfolds, readers will gain valuable insights into the evolving landscape of RRT and its applications, positioning them at the forefront of this engaging field of study. On RRT, the literature has grown immensely since its inception in 1965 by S.L. Warner. Despite several books published on the subject, there are still two crucial topics missing from the existing RRT literature. This book aims to address these gaps and provide valuable insights to curious readers in the field. The book is mandatory reading for statisticians and biostatisticians, market researchers, operations researchers, pollsters, sociologists, political scientists, economists and advanced undergraduate and graduate students in these areas.",

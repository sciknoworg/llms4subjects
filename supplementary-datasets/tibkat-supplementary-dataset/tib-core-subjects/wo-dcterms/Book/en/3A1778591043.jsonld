            "abstract": "This meeting sought to give an account of the issues raised in Social Sciences worldwide by the migrations and mobilities of populations, particularly Syrian, caused by the upheavals taking place in the South and East of the Mediterranean since 2011. Researchers coming from various disciplines of Social Sciences, who are working on migration issues in Europe, the USA, and the Middle-East, in a historical perspective and with an ethnographic approach, participated in the Conference. A roundtable with representatives from different associations and NGOs closed the conference. A selection of full communications of the conference will be published by Edward Elgar Publishing (Migration, Mobilities and the Arab Spring. Spaces of Refugee Flight in the Eastern Mediterranean). This volume presents the abstracts of the conference communications.",

            "abstract": "Dialysis (clearance of uremic toxins and removal of excess fluids) is a broad term for different modalities of treatment for patients with acute and end-stage kidney disease. These modalities include peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration, and continuous renal replacement therapy for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. Dialysis is a lifesaving measure and can be conducted in hospitals, in dialysis clinics, and at home. Recently, dialysis techniques have witnessed tremendous improvements in technology and performance. The book Aspects in Dialysis covers important aspects of dialysis-related topics and is empowered with well-established and experienced authors, who have written clear and informative chapters. It covers various aspects of dialysis modalities supported by well-established clinical studies. Aspects in Dialysis can be considered as a guide for daily practice and a reference for medical and nursing staff involved in taking care of dialysis patients",

            "abstract": "Engineering design concerns us all. In new products we expect higher quality, better reliability, lower cost, improved safety and more respect for the environment. The Design Manager is responsible for fulfilling these disparate and often mutually contradictory expectations, guiding the design team while liaising with and drawing support from project managers, manufacturers, marketing staff, customers and users. Design Managers and their teams will find the revised and expanded second edition of Managing Engineering Design to be a practical book providing a framework of precepts for the management of engineering design projects. Features include: jargon-free language with well-tried, real-world examples; useful tips for managers at the end of each chapter; a comprehensive bibliography at the end of the book. Managing Engineering Design is for design managers in industry, general managers with responsibility for design projects, and those training to become technical or design managers. It is also highly informative for graduate and undergraduate engineering students and ideally suited for establishing a web-based design management system for geographically dispersed teams. \"This remarkable book, based on sound empirical research and design project experience, will be an enormous help to design managers and design engineers\u2026\" Professor Ken Wallace, University of Cambridge \"The practical approach of Hales and Gooch particularly appealed to me\u2026 [they] manage to pull together a concise package of best practice in engineering management and successfully tie together the different activities that are often presented as unconnected. This is no minor feat and I lift my hat to them.\" Doctor Roope Takala, Program Manager, Nokia Group",

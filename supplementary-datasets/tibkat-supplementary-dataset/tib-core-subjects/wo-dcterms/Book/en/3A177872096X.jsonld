            "abstract": "Surface texture is one of the most critical factors and important functionality indicators in the performance of high precision and nanoscale devices and components. The functions  that have been identified in various studies include wear, friction, lubrication, corrosion,  fatigue, coating, paintability, etc. [1-3]. It is also reported that the wear rates of surfaces in  operational service is determined by roughness, waviness and the multi-scalar topographic  features of a surface, such as random peaks/pits and ridges/valleys. These functional  topographical features will impact directly on wear mechanics and physical properties of a  whole system, such as hip joint replacement system in bioengineering [4-9]. For example,  during functional operation of interacting surfaces, peaks and ridges will act as sites of high  contact stresses and abrasion; consequently wear particles and debris will be generated by  such surface topographical features, whereas the pits and valleys will affect the lubrication  and fluid retention properties. In this situation, a vitally important consideration for  functional characterisation must be the appropriate separation of the different components  of surfaces, which is not only to extract roughness, waviness and form error, but should also  be extended to all multi-scalar topographical events over surfaces",

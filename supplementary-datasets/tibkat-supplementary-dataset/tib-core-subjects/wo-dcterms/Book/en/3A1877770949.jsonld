            "title": "Chapter Introduction : \u201cWATCH ME WORK\u201d: REFLECTIONS ON SUZAN-LORI PARKS AND HER CANON",
            "abstract": "Suzan-Lori Parks is widely recognized as one of the most provocative and prolific dramatists of the current millennium. The winner of numerous awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award, Parks has given the American theater an entirely new, challenging stage language that resonates with insightful puns and historical allusions. Only three years after her college graduation and the production (as a staged reading) of her first play, her senior thesis, The Sinner\u2019s Place (1985), Suzan-Lori Parks\u2019s immense talent and potential to radically transform American theater were widely touted by leading theater critics. In 1989, Mel Gussow, senior critic for the New York Times, lauded the playwright for her \u201ctheatrical versatility\u201d and originality. Four years later, the New York Times hailed her as one of \u201c30 artists under 30 most likely to change the culture for the next 30 years,\u201d and in 1999, Time Magazine numbered Parks among the \u201c100 Innovators for the Next Wave.\u201d Two years later, Parks, who by then had already won two OBIE Awards, was given a $500,000 \u201cGenius\u201d grant from the MacArthur Foundation. The following year, she won the Tony Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Since then, she has re-envisioned the idea of the \u201cworld premiere\u201d and \u201copening night\u201d by having her collection of more than 365 plays, 365 Days/365 Plays, staged at over 700 theaters in the United States and approximately 100 theaters across Canada and Europe from 2006\u20132007, thrown back the curtain on her writing process by literally inviting audiences to \u201cWatch Me Work,\u201d and adapted American operatic and literary classics, such as Porgy and Bess and Their Eyes Were Watching God, for the theatrical stage and the television screen. Although primarily a playwright, Parks has demonstrated exceptional talent in art forms other than theater. She is a best-selling novelist (Getting Mother\u2019s Body) and a screenwriter (Spike Lee\u2019s Girl 6). A musician, she wrote the score for Father Comes Home from the War and the libretto for Ray Charles Live!\u2014A New Musical! Parks even composed several original songs, including \u201cThe Looking Song\u201d for her Red Letter Plays, In the Blood (1999) and Fucking A (2000). As a vocalist and guitarist as well, she has reincarnated herself as Sula Parks and has performed at the Public Theater and elsewhere",

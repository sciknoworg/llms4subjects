            "title": "Cold War Cosmopolitanism : Period Style in 1950s Korean Cinema",
            "abstract": "\"Han Hyung-mo was a major figure within South Korea\u2019s Golden Age cinema.  The director of Madame Freedom (1956), the most famous film of the 1950s, Han made popular films that explored women\u2019s relationship to modernity.  He was also a master stylist who introduced technological innovations and fresh ideas about film form and genre into Korean cinema.  This book offers a transnational cultural history of Han\u2019s films, one that foregrounds questions of gender and style.  Han\u2019s films embody a period style that Klein calls \u201cCold War cosmopolitanism.\u201d  The waging of the Cold War enmeshed South Korea within a network of ties to the Free World. Fostered by political leaders like Syngman Rhee, American institutions such as the US military and the Asia Foundation, and ordinary Koreans, these networks created channels through which material resources, liberal ideas, and cultural texts flowed into and out of Korea. Han and other cultural producers tapped into these networks to create new forms of commercial culture that meshed local concerns with foreign trends. Combining extensive archival research and in-depth analyses of individual films, Cold War Cosmopolitanism offers a fresh, interdisciplinary perspective on the waging of the cultural Cold War in Asia.\"",

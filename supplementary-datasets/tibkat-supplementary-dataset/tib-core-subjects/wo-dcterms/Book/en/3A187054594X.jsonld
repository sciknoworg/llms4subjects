            "abstract": "\"This ground-breaking book presents interdisciplinary instructors with classroom tools and strategies to integrate environmental justice into their courses. Providing accessible, flexible, and evidence-based pedagogical approaches designed by a multidisciplinary team of scholars, it centers equity and justice in student learning and course design. It further presents a model for community-based faculty development that can communicate those pedagogical approaches across disciplines. Key Features: - Reflection on how to teach inclusively across disciplines, with a focus on community-based faculty development. - Presentation of a blend of insights from diverse disciplines, including art, astronomy, ecology, economics, history, political science, and online education. - A focus on how to stimulate student engagement to improve students' empirical and conceptual understanding of environmental politics. - Detailed instructions for both introductory and more advanced active learning assignments and classroom activities, including guidance on how to manage common challenges and adapt activities to specific learning environments, particularly online formats. Providing detailed instructions and reflections on teaching effectively and inclusively, Teaching Environmental Justice will be an invaluable resource for faculty and graduate students teaching modules in environmental justice in courses across disciplines. It will also be essential reading for researchers of teaching and learning seeking insight into cutting-edge classroom practices that center equity and justice in student learning\"--",

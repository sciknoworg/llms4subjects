            "abstract": "March 2000 - Saving rates vary considerably across countries and over time. Policies that spur development are an indirect but effective way to raise private saving rates - which rise with the level and growth rate of real per capita income. Loayza, Schmidt-Hebbel, and Serv\u00e9n investigate the policy and nonpolicy factors behind saving disparities, using a large panel data set and an encompassing approach including several relevant determinants of private saving. They extend the literature in several dimensions by: \u00b7 Using the largest data set on aggregate saving assembled to date. \u00b7 Using panel instrumental variable techniques to correct for endogeneity and heterogeneity. \u00b7 Performing robustness checks on changes in estimation procedures, data samples, and model specification. Their main empirical findings: \u00b7 Private saving rates show considerable inertia (are highly serially correlated even after controlling for other relevant factors). \u00b7 Private saving rates rise with the level and growth rate of real per capita income. So policies that spur development are an indirect but effective way to raise private saving rates. \u00b7 Predictions of the life-cycle hypothesis are supported in that dependency ratios generally have a negative effect on private saving rates. \u00b7 The precautionary motive for saving is supported by the finding that inflation - conventionally taken as a summary measure of macroeconomic volatility - has a positive impact on private saving, holding other facts constant. \u00b7 Fiscal policy is a moderately effective tool for raising national saving. \u00b7 The direct effects of financial liberalization are largely detrimental to private saving rates. Greater availability of credit reduces the private saving rate; financial depth and higher real interest rates do not increase saving. This paper - a product of Macroeconomics and Growth, Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the group to understand the determinants of saving in developing countries. The study was funded by the Bank's Research Support Budget under the research project Saving in the World: Puzzles and Policies (RPO 681-36).

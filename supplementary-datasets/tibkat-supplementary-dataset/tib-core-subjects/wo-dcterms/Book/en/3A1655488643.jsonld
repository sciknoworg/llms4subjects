                "Recent years have witnessed a surge of activity in the field of dynamic both theory and applications. Theoretical as well as practical games, in problems in zero-sum and nonzero-sum games, continuous time differential and discrete time multistage games, and deterministic and stochastic games games are currently being investigated by researchers in diverse disciplines, such as engineering, mathematics, biology, economics, management science, and political science. This surge of interest has led to the formation of the International Society of Dynamic Games (ISDG) in 1990, whose primary goal is to foster the development of advanced research and applications in the field of game theory. One important activity of the Society is to organize biannually an international symposium which aims at bringing together all those who contribute to the development of this active field of applied science. In 1992 the symposium was organized in Grimentz, Switzerland, under the supervision of an international scientific committee and with the help of a local organizing committee based at University of Geneva. This book, which is the first volume in the new Series, Annals of the International Society of Dynamic Games (see the Preface to the Series), is based on presentations made at this symposium. It is however more than a book of proceedings for a conference. Every paper published in this volume has passed through a very selective refereeing process, as in an archival technical journal.",

            "title": "Mathematical Simulation in Glass Technology",
            "abstract": "This book is one of a series reporting on international research and development activities conducted by the Schott Group companies. With the series, Schott aims to provide an overview of its activities for scientists, engineers and managers from all branches of industry worldwide where glasses and glass ceramics are of interest. Each volume begins with a chapter providing a general idea of the current problems, results and trends related to the subject treated. This volume reports on a large variety of mathematical simulations, covering all production steps of special glass manufacturing: melting, fining, mixing, homogenizing, hot and cold forming, thermal treatment, post-processing. Modern, commercially available software packages have been used and - whenever necessary - modified to satisfy the special requirements and situations in liquid or solid glasses, or the boundary conditions of forming processes.The CD-ROM shows 27 simulations of different aspects such as surprising details of the pressing and casting process. The mathematical approach often helps understanding the overall and sometimes hidden features of processes and thus is a highly efficient tool for optimization efforts. Complementing and partly replacing experimental investigations, mathematical simulation enables considerable savings in time and money. Several of the results reported here are unique and published for the first time. Today, the methods of mathematical simulation are an integral part of problem solving in glass technology. The book is conceived as a monograph. The individual chapters, however, are written by different Schott experts or Schott's cooperation partners from international research institutes or universities. The scientific and technical background of the methods, as well as selected results and applications are treated in detail",

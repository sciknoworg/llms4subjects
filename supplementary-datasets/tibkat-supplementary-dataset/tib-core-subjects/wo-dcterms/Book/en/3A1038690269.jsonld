                "This book features papers presented during a special session on dynamical systems, mathematical physics, and partial differential equations. Research articles are devoted to broad complex systems and models such as qualitative theory of dynamical systems, theory of games, circle diffeomorphisms, piecewise smooth circle maps, nonlinear parabolic systems, quadtratic dynamical systems, billiards, and intermittent maps. Focusing on a variety of topics from dynamical properties to stochastic properties of dynamical systems, this volume includes discussion on discrete-numerical tracking, conjugation between two critical circle maps, invariance principles, and the central limit theorem. Applications to game theory and networks are also included. Graduate students and researchers interested in complex systems, differential equations, dynamical systems, functional analysis, and mathematical physics will find this book useful for their studies. The special session was part of the second USA-Uzbekistan Conference on Analysis and Mathematical Physics held on August 8-12, 2017 at Urgench State University (Uzbekistan). The conference encouraged communication and future collaboration among U.S. mathematicians and their counterparts in Uzbekistan and other countries. Main themes included algebra and functional analysis, dynamical systems, mathematical physics and partial differential equations, probability theory and mathematical statistics, and pluripotential theory. A number of significant, recently established results were disseminated at the conference\u2019s scheduled plenary talks, while invited talks presented a broad spectrum of findings in several sessions. Based on a different session from the conference, Algebra, Complex Analysis, and Pluripotential Theory is also published in the Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics Series"

            "abstract": "In the world economy, all economic players have to analyse the changing dynamics of sharpening global competition and transform their systems-structures to keep up with these competitive conditions. In order to steer the global competitive dynamics, they have to develop strong innovations with high added value that differentiate them from their competitors. In the world ecosystem, where the global competitive climate is extremely destructive, companies and countries should correctly analyse the dynamics of global competition, their resources, strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats from the external environment. On the other hand, they have to formulate their own goals and global competition strategies, through which they can achieve these goals most effectively. Firms and countries should establish an effective corporate governance-production architecture in order to sustain their competitive edge, profitability and growth at the global level in the long term. On the other hand, they should be able to offer high value added goods and services to the market in more advantageous conditions compared to their competitors, considering other criteria such as price, cost, efficiency, efficiency, quality, aesthetics and image. As a result, a high level Science-R&D-technology-innovation management-production architecture is of great importance for a successful global competition strategy at the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels. In this context, in this study, we focused on the effects of the Science-R&D-technology-innovations on the global competition dynamics and sustainable economic growth at the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels for different countries and regions in the world economy. We would like to thank the sections' authors, the management and staff of Istanbul University for their support and contributions in the emergence of this work",

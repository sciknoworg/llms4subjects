After a basic introduction to the NoC design paradigm and architectures, routing algorithms for NoC architectures are presented and discussed at all abstraction levels, from the algorithmic level to actual implementation. Coverage emphasizes the role played by the routing algorithm and is organized around key problems affecting current and next generation, many-core SoCs. A selection of routing algorithms is included, specifically designed to address key issues faced by designers in the ultra-deep sub-micron (UDSM) era, including performance improvement, power, energy, and thermal issues, fault tolerance and reliability. \u00b7 Provides a comprehensive overview of routing algorithms for Networks-on-Chip and NoC-based, manycore systems; \u00b7 Describes routing algorithms for NoC architectures at all abstraction levels, from the algorithmic level to actual implementation; \u00b7 Discusses the impact on NoC routing algorithms of key design objectives, such as power dissipation, energy consumption, thermal aspects, reliability, and performance.--",

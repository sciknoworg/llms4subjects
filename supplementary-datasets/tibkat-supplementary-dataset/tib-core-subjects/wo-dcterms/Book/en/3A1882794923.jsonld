Coverage includes both technology and applications, with an in-depth review of the research topics conducted at leading research institutions in the world. The conversion of the X-ray signal into an analogue/digital value is discussed, as well as a review of CMOS chips used for X-ray image sensors. Applications of hybrid pixel detectors are discussed, such as medical imaging, high energy physics, space, non-destructive testing and security. Provides coverage of a broad range of topics, from international experts in academia and industry; Includes in-depth analysis of how to optimize X-ray detection and electronics for X-ray detection; Covers both technology and applications in a number of different domains."

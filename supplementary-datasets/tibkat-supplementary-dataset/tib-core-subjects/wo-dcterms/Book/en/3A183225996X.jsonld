            "abstract": "In the search for a healthier diet and facing the uncertainties about the consumption of artificial additives, the scientific community has explored in the last years the potential of natural compounds, such as polyphenols, carotenoids, chlorophylls, essential oils, tocopherols, vitamins, polysaccharides, among others, obtained from the most diverse sources, such as plants and fungi, for the replacement of the artificial additives in food, which has made these compounds recognized as \"natural additives\". In addition to being considered less harmful to health, and giving a certain functional property to a foodstuff, natural additives can also provide a beneficial synergistic effect in the food matrix. For the consumers, diverse studies have been showed that regular ingestion of bioactive compounds, that can be applied as natural additives, can be helpful for the prevention/treatment of several chronic and aging illnesses, such as cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. However, there is much to be researched on the viable use of bioactive compounds and to overcome their chemical limitations so that it can actually be used as natural additives in foods. This book addresses, through 18 scientific articles, some natural compounds with potential for use as preservatives, nutritional additives, coloring agents, flavorings, and various agents",

                "\u201cThis book is a pioneering attempt to systematically and concretely analyze diverse knowledge actors, focusing on a typology of their modalities of knowledge interaction. Highly recommended for researchers, policy makers, and practitioners interested in shaping the future of knowledge partnerships.\u201d ---Izumi Ohno, Professor, National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS), Japan \"The authors in this timely and very accessible book, leaning on a wealth of experiences across the world, expose the diverse modalities of knowledge production and exchange which already occur and probably should occur in the realm of interactions we call 'development'. They emphasize the need for co-production of knowledge, while wisely refraining from replacing one form of modernism by new high-modernist state building projects and their models of knowledge for development.\" ---Kristof Van Assche, Professor Planning, Governance & Development, Universityof Alberta, Canada In this open access book, we provide evidence to support the conceptual discussion of what constitutes \u201cmodalities of knowledge interaction\u201d and suggest an analytical framework for effective knowledge cooperation. In practice, knowledge cooperation is realised through different modalities that serve as a toolbox to co-create, share and communicate knowledge among actors. Effective knowledge cooperation is crucial to addressing global challenges. It is increasingly attracting attention due to the rise of South\u2013South Cooperation, to which it is central. Our empirical cases (Germany, India, Republic of Korea and Rwanda) comprise South-South cooperation and traditional development cooperation actors.

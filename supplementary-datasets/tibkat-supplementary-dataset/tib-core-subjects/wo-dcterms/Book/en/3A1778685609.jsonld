The goal of this book is to enable the reader to get instant information on fundamentals and advancements in chemical engineering. This book addresses ongoing evolutions of chemical engineering and provides overview to the sate of the art advancements. Molecular perspective is increasingly important in the refinement of kinetic and thermodynamic molding. As a result, much of the material was revised on industrial problems and their sophisticated solutions from known scientists around the world. These issues were divided in to two sections, fundamental advances and catalysis and reaction engineering. A distinct feature of this text continues to be the emphasis on molecular chemistry, reaction engineering and modeling to achieve rational and robust industrial design. Our perspective is that this background must be made available to undergraduate, graduate and professionals in an integrated manner",

            "abstract": "An understanding of the techniques used to make distributed computing systems and networks reliable, fault-tolerant and secure will be crucial to those involved in designing and deploying the next generation of mission-critical applications and Web Services. Reliable Distributed Systems reviews and describes the key concepts, principles and applications of modern distributed computing systems and architectures. The book consists of three parts. The first covers introductory material, including the basic architecture of the Internet, simple protocols such as RPC and TCP, object oriented architectures, operating systems enhancements for high performance, and reliability issues. The second covers the Web, with a focus on Web Services technologies, Microsoft's .NET and the Java Enterprise Edition. The third and most extensive part of the book looks at a number of reliability and fault-tolerance issues and techniques, with an emphasis on replication applied in Web Services settings. TOPICS & FEATURES: *Explains fault tolerance in clear terms, with concrete examples drawn from real-world settings *A practical focus aimed at building \"mission-critical\" networked applications that remain secure*Includes modern topics, such as Cobra, Web Services, XML, .NET, J2EE, group communication, transactions, peer-to-peer systems, scalability, and security *Reviews more than 25 major research efforts *Includes 80 problems *Web-based materials available for instructors With its well-focused approach and clarity of presentation, this book is an excellent resource for advanced students and practitioners in computer science, computer networks and distributed systems. Anyone seeking to develop a solid grounding in distributed computing and Web Services architectures will find the book an essential and practical learning tool. TOC:* Fundamentals * Basic communication services * High assurance communication * Remote procedure calls and the Client/Server model * Common Object Request Broker Architecture * Styles of Client/Server computing * System support for fast Client/Server communication * World Wide Web * Major web technologies * Web Services * Related Internet technologies * Platform technologies * How and why computer systems fail * Tracking membershipin a distributed system * Group communication systems * Virtual synchrony execution model * Consistency in distributed systems * Retrofitting reliability into complex systems * Software architecturesfor group communication * Secu ...",

            "abstract": [
                "This brief textbook underpins the concept of eco-efficiency in product design and systematically addresses the essence of the integration of simplified life cycle assessment (LCA) methods and tools into industrial design. Fundamental steps of LCA-based tools implementation within the higher education context are proposed, using energy-related products (ErP) design as a prime case study. All chapters are designed to respond to the common frequently asked questions in LCA-based tools implementation during the sustainable product design process. The chapters are also enriched with discussions, data sources of simplified LCA tools, and examples of design assignments that provide constructive learning. Some assignments aim at encouraging tool users\u2019 reflections while others tackle particularly at knowledge exchange. The examples can assist the reader to visualize challenges and opportunities to engage learners who are tool users. This textbook broadens LCA knowledge for industrial design and environmental engineering students as well as enhance their sustainable product design performance. For professional practitioners including industrial designers, product engineers, entrepreneurs and the like, this textbook can be used as a guide at the introductory level for integrating life cycle thinking into product design and development.",

            "abstract": "\"The eco-friendly remediation technologies for the degraded environment are indeed the \"need of the hour\". Even though the regulatory mechanisms are in place to control the discharge of untreated contaminants into the natural environment, still, we could see a different picture; hence, remediation and restoration of the environment become an ardent requisite. The present-day fast pace of industrialization without proper disposal planning is impacting the water bodies adversely generating the need for green management technologies. It is worth mentioning that these environment-friendly technologies are most cost-effective as well. The advancements in Biotechnology have paved the way to mitigate the problem. The primary audience of this book is the students and researchers who are working in the field of toxicology & bioremediation of aquatic environments. We have primarily focused in this book on bioremediation of aquatic system toxicity considering this as an environment-friendly system and having the least adverse effects. Hence this book aims to bring forward together on a single platform the latest research in aquatic resource management which includes the discussions and discourses on the degradation and the effect and the remediation. This book includes a discussion on the different sources of contamination from industries or by the usage of commercial pesticides or even fertilizers. These contaminants if discharged in their toxic form as effluent it causes harm to the aquatic systems, the subsoil and creating the possibility of groundwater contamination. This book includes a discussion on the different routes of contamination, and the food-chain transport possibilities of pesticide pollutants, which are very contemporary and required topics of research. It also includes relevant discussions on how to get away with the toxicity\"--",

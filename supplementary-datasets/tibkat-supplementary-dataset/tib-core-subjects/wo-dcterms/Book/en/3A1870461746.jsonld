            "abstract": [
                "The admiration of science and technology and the emphasis on political stability are two sides of the same coin in China. Therefore, China is more likely to take aggressive measures to promote or inhibit platform development than the United States and the European Union. But the uncertainty in the decision-making process is worrisome and calls for a broader discussion of the multiple political consequences of technology. Yuhao Jiang is a researcher at the Institute of Public Policy at South China University of Technology. He is a doctor of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Professor Yuhao was a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Public Administration, Tsinghua University, and a visiting scholar at the European University Institute in Italy. Yuhao Jiang\u2019s research interests include digital governance, Chinese science and technology policy, techno-politics, and Chinese political economy. He has published books such as \"Mutiple Modernities and Critical Jurisprudence\" and \"Deliberative Democracy and Orderly Participation. Kai Jia is an associate professor in the School of International and Public Affairs, Shanghai Jiaotong University. He is also a researcher in the Center for Industrial Development and Environmental Governance of Tsinghua University. Dr. Kai is the Fulbright Scholar, visiting scholar in UC Davis, ETLA (Helsinki) and EBS(Tallinn).

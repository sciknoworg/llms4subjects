Numerous research topics are covered, ranging from statistical inference and modeling to clustering and dimension reduction, from functional data analysis to time series analysis, and network analysis. The applications reflect new analyses in a variety of fields, including medicine, marketing, genetics, engineering, and education. The book comprises selected and peer-reviewed papers presented at the 17th Conference of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS 2022), held in Porto, Portugal, July 19\u201323, 2022. The IFCS federates the classification societies and the IFCS biennial conference brings together researchers and stakeholders in the areas of Data Science, Classification, and Machine Learning. It provides a forum for presenting high-quality theoretical and applied works, and promoting and fostering interdisciplinary research and international cooperation. The intended audience is researchers and practitioners who seek the latest developments and applications in the field of data science and classification",

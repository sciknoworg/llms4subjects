            "abstract": "\"David Harvey\u2019s The Condition of Postmodernity rationalised capitalism\u2019s transformation during an extraordinary year: 1989. It gave theoretical expression to a material and cultural reality that was just then getting properly started \u2013 globalisation and postmodernity \u2013 whilst highlighting the geo-spatial limits to accumulation imposed by our planet.  However this landmark publication, author Robert Hassan argues, did not address the arrival of digital technology, the quantum leap represented by the move from an analogue world to a digital economy and the rapid creation of a global networked society. Considering first the contexts of 1989 and Harvey\u2019s work, then the idea of humans as analogue beings he argues this arising new human condition of digitality leads to alienation not only from technology but also the environment. This condition he suggests, is not an ideology of time and space but a reality stressing that Harvey\u2019s time-space compression takes on new features including those of \u2018outward\u2019 and \u2018inward\u2019 globalisation and the commodification of all spheres of existence.  Lastly the author considers culture\u2019s role drawing on Rahel Jaeggi\u2019s theories to make the case for a post-modern Marxism attuned to the most significant issue of our age. Stimulating and theoretically wide-ranging The Condition of Digitality recognises post-modernity\u2019s radical new form as a reality and the urgent need to assert more democratic control over digitality.\"",

            "abstract": "In addition to the usual abstracts of research reported since the previous retrospective, this issue comprises ten invited papers. The first four are reviews that cover the important topics of conductive oxide preparation, the modeling of amorphous materials (silicon carbide, for example), the nanoscale characterization of oxides and the effect of combined irradiation treatments.The other six invited papers present recent experimental or theoretical studies of structural defects in gallium nitride, atomic-scale deformation processes in nanomaterials, micropipes in silicon carbide, radiation effects in garnets and boron diffusion in hafnia.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS). As usual, the choice of abstracts is guided by criteria such as accessibility, data content and coverage of new techniques, phenomena or anomalies. There is also thorough coverage of qualitative features of diffusion and defect phenomena, computer modeling and theory. This volume also contains fourteen papers which were inspired by a Summer School on Mechanical Spectroscopy, held at Aussois (France) in mid-2001, where the participants presented recent results in the form of poster sessions. Subsequently, 26 papers were selected for publication. Those which were particularly relevant to metals research were published in the previous issue (Defect and Diffusion Forum, Volumes 203-205) . The present Aussois papers cover a very wide range of materials. Among those of interest to ceramics specialists are: barium titanate (effect of vacancies), lead zirconium titanate (anelasticity), praseodymium calcium manganite (anelasticity), yttria and zirconia (internal friction, diffusion) and silicon nitride (internal friction).Altogether, the invited papers and abstracts provide a useful guide to a wide range of developing topics in the field of defects and diffusion in ceramics",

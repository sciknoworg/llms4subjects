                "Andr\u00e9 F. Nebe uses his humour structure analysis to make viewers' preferences and corresponding audiovisual offerings in films visible. Complex and multi-layered audiovisual (hypotactic) humour is used in the more successful films, while less successful films make simple (paratactic) humour offerings. Humour structure analysis offers insights into promising humour offerings and can also be used in the story development phase for writers, directors, producers and dramaturges. The content Humour in science and practice Questioning children about humour Components of humour-categorised film analysis Correlations between children's humour preferences and humour offerings in the analysed films Correlations to budget, shooting days and number of visitors The target groups Lecturers and students of media studies and film schools Film producers and directors, scriptwriters, TV editors, licence buyers for film/TV, film funding institutions The author Andr\u00e9 F. Nebe studied law at the Humboldt University in Berlin, film directing at the University of Hamburg and earned his doctorate at the Babelsberg Film University. Among other things, he is the director of the feature film \"Das grosse Rennen\", author of various episodes of the ZDF series \"L\u00f6wenzahn\", was an editor for the SWR children's series \"Motzgurke\" and is the author of children's books in the series \"Die Geisterreiter\" and \"Die K\u00fcstenw\u00f6lfe\".

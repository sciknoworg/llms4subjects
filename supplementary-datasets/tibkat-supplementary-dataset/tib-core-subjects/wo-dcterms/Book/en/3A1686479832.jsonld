            "abstract": "\"Engendering Cities examines the contemporary research, policy and practice of designing for gender in urban spaces. Gender matters in city design, yet despite legislative mandates across the globe to provide equal access to services for men and women alike, these issues are still often overlooked or inadequately addressed. This book looks at critical aspects of contemporary cities regarding gender, including topics such as transport, housing, public health, education, caring, infrastructure, as well as issues which are rarely addressed in planning, design and policy such as the importance of toilets for education and clothes washers for freeing time. In the first section, a number of chapters in the book assess past, current and projected conditions in cities vis-a-vis gender issues and needs. In the second section, the book assesses existing policy, planning and design efforts to improve women's and men's concerns in urban living. Finally, it proposes changes to existing policies and practices in urban planning and design, including its thinking (theory) and norms (ethics). The book applies the current scholarship on theory and practice related to gender in a planning context, elaborating on some critical community-focused reflections on gender and design. It will be key reading for scholars and students of planning, architecture, design, gender studies, sociology, anthropology, geography, and political science. It will also be of interest to practitioners and policy makers, providing discussion of emerging topics in the field\"--",

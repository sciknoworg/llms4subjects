            "abstract": "The rapid growth of the world population has resulted in an exponential expansion of both urban and agricultural areas. Identifying and managing such earthly changes in an automatic way poses a worth-addressing challenge, in which remote sensing technology can have a fundamental role to answer\u2014at least partially\u2014such demands. The recent advent of cutting-edge processing facilities has fostered the adoption of deep learning architectures owing to their generalization capabilities. In this respect, it seems evident that the pace of deep learning in the remote sensing domain remains somewhat lagging behind that of its computer vision counterpart. This is due to the scarce availability of ground truth information in comparison with other computer vision domains. In this book, we aim at advancing the state of the art in linking deep learning methodologies with remote sensing image processing by collecting 20 contributions from different worldwide scientists and laboratories. The book presents a wide range of methodological advancements in the deep learning field that come with different applications in the remote sensing landscape such as wildfire and postdisaster damage detection, urban forest mapping, vine disease and pavement marking detection, desert road mapping, road and building outline extraction, vehicle and vessel detection, water identification, and text-to-image matching",

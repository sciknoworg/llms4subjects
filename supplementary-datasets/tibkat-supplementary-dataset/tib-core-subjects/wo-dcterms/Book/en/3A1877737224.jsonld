The book is divided into three parts focusing on the essentials of general concepts, diagnosis, and management of accident and emergency medicine, as well as an academic approach to teaching in the emergency setting. The chapters selected for this book are written by an excellent group of recognized emergency surgeons and physicians from different countries and cultures facilitating a comprehensive and interesting approach to the problems of emergency treatment.

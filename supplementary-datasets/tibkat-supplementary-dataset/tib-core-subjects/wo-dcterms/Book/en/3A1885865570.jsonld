            "abstract": "This book explores the current state of healthcare practice and provides a roadmap for harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) and other modern cognitive technologies for neurogenerative diseases. The main goal of this book is to look at how these techniques can be used to classify patients with neurodegenerative diseases by extracting data from multiple modalities. It demonstrates that the growing development of computer-aided diagnosis systems has a lot of potential to help with the diagnostic process. It offers an analysis of the prospective and perils in implementing such state of the art. Progressive brain disorders with a high prevalence in the general population include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, Huntington's disease, and motor neuron disease. Worldwide, it is estimated that 33 million people have Alzheimer's disease, and 10 million people have Parkinson's disease. The global health economy is significantly impacted by these disorders, which affect both the patient and the caregivers. Various diagnostic techniques are used for differential diagnoses, such as brain imaging, EEG analysis, molecular analysis, and cognitive, psychological, and physical examination. The book aims to develop effective treatments, enhance patient quality of life, and extend life expectancy. It focuses on novel artificial intelligence approaches to clarify the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and provide early diagnosis.  The authors compile recent developments based on machine learning and deep learning techniques to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases using imaging, genetic, and clinical data. The authors support initiatives and methods that aim to improve the application of algorithms in diagnostic practice",

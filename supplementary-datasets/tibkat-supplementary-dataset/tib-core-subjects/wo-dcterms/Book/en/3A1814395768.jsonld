                "Migrate your existing, on-premises applications into the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. This book covers the best practices to plan, implement, and operationalize the migration of a database application from your organization\u2019s data center to Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform. Data modernization and migration is a technologically complex endeavor that can also be taxing from a leadership and operational standpoint. This book covers not only the technology, but also the most important aspects of organization culture, communication, and politics that so frequently derail such projects. You will learn the most important steps to ensuring a successful migration and see battle-tested wisdom from industry veterans. From executive sponsorship, to executing the migration, to the important steps following migration, you will learn how to effectively conduct future migrations and ensure that your team and your database application delivers on the expected business value of the project. This book is unlike any other currently in the market. It takes you through the most critical business and technical considerations and workflows for moving your data and databases into the cloud, with special attention paid to those who are deploying to the Microsoft Data Platform in Azure, especially SQL Server. Although this book focuses on migrating on-premises SQL Server enterprises to hybrid or fully cloud-based Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instances, it also cover topics involving migrating non-SQL Server database platforms such as Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL applications to Microsoft Azure. What You Will Learn Plan a database migration that ensures smooth project progress, optimal performance, low operating cost, and minimal downtime Properly analyze and manage non-technical considerations, such as legal compliance, privacy, and team execution Perform a thorough architectural analysis to select the best Azure services, performance tiers, and cost-containment features Avoid pitfalls and common reasons for failure relating to corporate culture, intra-office politics, and poor communications Secure the proper executive champions who can execute the business planning needed for success Apply proven criteria to determine your future-state architecture and your migration method Execute your migration using a process proven by the authors over years of successful projects."

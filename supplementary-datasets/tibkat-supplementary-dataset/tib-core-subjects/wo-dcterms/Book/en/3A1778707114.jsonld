            "abstract": "Wireless cellular networks are an integral part of modern telecommunication systems. Today it is hard to imagine our life without the use of such networks. Nevertheless, the development, implementation and operation of these networks require engineers and scientists to address a number of interrelated problems. Among them are the problem of choosing the proper geometric shape and dimensions of cells based on geographical location, finding the optimal location of cell base station, selection the scheme dividing the total net bandwidth between its cells, organization of the handover of a call between cells, information security and network reliability, and many others. The book focuses on three types of problems from the above list - Positioning, Performance Analysis and Reliability. It contains three sections. The Section 1 is devoted to problems of Positioning and contains five chapters. The Section 2 contains eight Chapters which are devoted to quality of service (QoS) metrics analysis of wireless cellular networks. The Section 3 contains two Chapters and deal with reliability issues of wireless cellular networks. The book will be useful to researches in academia and industry and also to post-gradute students in telecommunication specialitiies",

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 crisis combined with the global repercussions from the Russian invasion of Ukraine exacerbated the stress on financial systems around the world. More than 150 countries introduced policy measures to support the financial sector amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures included debt moratoria, loan forbearance, and the relaxation of classification and provisioning rules, a truly unprecedented response in its scale and speed. Central Asia is no exception. Policy makers in the region introduced temporary measures to support the financial sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. But even before one crisis is contained, the region faces another crisis stemming from the repercussions of the Russian war in Ukraine. Central Asian countries have strong economic and financial ties with Russia, which have, in turn, affected trade, remittances, the subsidiary operation of Russian banks, corresponding banking relationships, payment channels, among other systems. The compounded effect of the two crises has increased the pressure on both the repayment capacity of borrowers and the financial management of banks and other creditors. This report assesses the NPL resolution framework in four Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) and provides recommendations for improving it. Chapter 1 discusses the current trend in NPLs in Central Asia. Chapter 2 assesses how assets are classified and covered. Chapter 3 reviews the NPL reduction workout techniques practiced in Central Asia. Chapter 4 investigates supervisory measures that can be adapted to reduce NPLs. Chapter 5 reviews the role that the insolvency and creditors' rights framework play in this process. The report concludes in chapter 6 with specific recommendations for enhancing the readiness of banks and insolvency regimes for dealing with NPLs. Table 1 summarizes these recommendations",

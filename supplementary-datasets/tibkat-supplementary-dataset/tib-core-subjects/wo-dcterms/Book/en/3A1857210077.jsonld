            "abstract": "\"This book brings together diverse ideas on selected facets of globalisation and transitions in globalisation. The scholars that have contributed to this book examine the phenomenon of globalisation through varied lenses, focusing specifically on the human and economic perspectives. These analyses originate in many areas and different legal systems but are all connected through the work of Professor John Farrar and the associations of the contributors with him. This book does not attempt to provide answers to the many challenges of globalisation. Instead, this book discusses selected, particular aspects of globalisation that derive from and are connected to the authors\u2019 own research. The thematic diversity of this book is a true strength and should draw a broad range of readers. Whilst this book is primarily written from a legal angle, its content overlaps with broader specialised policy areas, with contributions ranging from taxation to ageing, from insolvency to social licences, and from refugees to the treatment of first nations people. In short, there is something for everyone in this book. As a tribute to the life\u2019s work of an outstanding legal scholar, Professor John Farrar, this book explores legal responses to the social and economic impacts of globalisation. After personal acknowledgments from colleagues highlighting the significance of his scholarship, this book is divided into two parts. The first part addresses the social impact of globalisation, focusing on immigration and the impact on First Nations people. Changes in the regulation of medicine and technologies related to ageing are also addressed in this part. In part two, the book addresses the transitioning corporate law landscape and notions of fairness and good faith in the law. The final part contains the conclusions, reflections and synthesis of the editors.\"",

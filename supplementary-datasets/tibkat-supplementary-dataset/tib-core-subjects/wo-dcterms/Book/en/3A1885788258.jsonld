            "title": "Confronting fragmentation : Housing and urban development in a democratising society",
            "abstract": "The fragmentation of South Africa\u2019s cities persists despite the ending of apartheid. New forms of segregation are emerging in the context of globalisation and a largely neo-liberal policy environment. This poses an enormous challenge for policy-making, planning, and community activism. Although there has been an improvement in service infrastructure in certain parts of South African cities since 1994, the major structural changes required to alter the trajectory of urban change have not yet happened. Confronting fragmentation: Housing and urban development in a democratising society provides a provocative, careful, analytical perspective on the problems of fragmentation, with particular relevance to the provision of urban shelter. The cross-national nature of the author team reflects the fact that many of the issues facing South Africa are being experienced globally. This is a fascinating book. The text is both theoretical and practical. It will be of great value to policy-makers, planners, community leaders, and students in the field of development and the built environment",

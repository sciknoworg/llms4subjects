            "abstract": "\"This book brings together two pieces of writing. In the first, \u201cAfter Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick,\u201d Jonathan Goldberg assesses her legacy, prompted mainly by writing about Sedgwick\u2019s work that has appeared in the years since her death in April 2009. Writing by Lauren Berlant, Jane Gallop, Katy Hawkins, Scott Herring, Lana Lin, and Philomina Tsoukala are among those considered as he explores questions of queer temporality and the breaching of ontological divides. Main concerns include the relationship of Sedgwick\u2019s later work in Proust, fiber, and Buddhism to her fundamental contribution to queer theory, and the axes of identification across difference that motivated her work and attachment to it.  \u201cCome As You Are,\u201d the other piece of writing, is a previously unpublished talk Sedgwick gave in 1999\u20132000. It represents a significant bridge between her earlier and later work, sharing with her book Tendencies the ambition to discover the \u201csomething\u201d that makes queer inextinguishable. In this piece, Sedgwick does that by contemplating her own mortality alongside her creative engagement with Buddhist thought, especially the in-between states named bardos and her newfound energy for making things. These were represented in a show of her fabric art, \u201cFloating Columns/In the Bardo,\u201d that accompanied her talk, a number of images of which are included in this book. They feature floating figures suspended in the realization of death. They are objects produced by Sedgwick, made of fabric; they come from her, yet are discontinuous with her, occupying a mode of existence that exceeds the span of human life and the confines of individual identity. They could be put beside the queer transitive identifications across difference that Goldberg\u2019s essay explores.\"",

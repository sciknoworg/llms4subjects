            "abstract": "This book gathers five papers presented to the ECAS\u2019 2013 proceedings. Following the theme of the Congress \u201cAfrican dynamics in a multipolar world\u201d, the challenge was to select among the 118 papers presented those which focused in the subjects of informality and space reconfiguration. The papers were selected from 4 panels: \u201cWriting the world from another African metropolis: Luanda and the urban question\u201d, \u201cUrbanisation and poverty in mining Africa\u201d, \u201cUrban imaginaries in Africa\u201d and \u201cManaging other people\u2019s money: financial services in sub-Saharan Africa after structural adjustment\u201d. In the editing process, we assumed that the intention of the authors when submitting papers to the ECAS\u2019 proceedings was to share and collect contributions from the academic community to improve their researches. This means that all the papers in this book are considered a work in progress. The editor\u2019s work, guided by the reviewers\u2019 comments was limited: the main goal was to present the preliminary insights. The authors are therefore expecting to receive contributions from the readers and, thinking ahead, why not opening new communication channels?",

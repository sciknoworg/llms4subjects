                "\u201cThis insightful book suggests that although a digital journey differs from a \u2018physical\u2019 one, it can be a rich and satisfying experience.\u201d \u2014 Andrea Gaggioli, Professor, Director of the ExperienceLab, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Italy \u201cTjostheim and Waterworth\u2019s combination of theoretical insights with user studies and critical analysis makes for an excellent read.\u201d \u2014 Anders Hedman, Associate Professor, KTH The Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden \u201cThis book offers an original and informative interpretation of travel in the electronically permeated world in which we now live.\u201d \u2014 Edward Relph, Emeritus Professor, Department of Geography and Planning, University of Toronto, Canada This open access book takes a fresh look at the nature of the digital travel experience, at a time when more and more people are engaged in online social interaction, games, and other virtual experiences essentially involving online visits to other places. It examines whether these experiences can seem real to the virtual traveller and, if so, under what conditions and on what grounds. The book unpacks philosophical theories relevant to the feeling of being somewhere, emphasising the importance of perception and being-in-the-world. Notions of place are outlined, based on work in tourism studies, human geography, and other applied social fields, with an aim to investigate how and when different experiences of place arise for the traveller and how these relate to telepresence \u2013 the sense of being there in another place through digital media. Findings from recent empirical studies of digital travel are presented, including a survey from which the characteristics of \u201cdigital travellers\u201d are identified. A review of selected interactive design trends and possibilities leads to the conclusion, which draws these strands together and looks to the future of this topical and expanding field. Ingvar Tjostheim, PhD, is Senior Researcher at the Norwegian Computing Center. John A. Waterworth PhD, CPsychol. is a consultant, writer and researcher. He is Professor Emeritus at the Department of Informatics, Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden."

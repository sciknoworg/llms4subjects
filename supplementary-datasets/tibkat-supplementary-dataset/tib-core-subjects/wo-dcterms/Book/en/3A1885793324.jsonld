Taking into account the new cognitive-discursive approach, the authors made an attempt to harmonize their scientific observations with the content of the studied macrolinguistic issues in the three parts of the monograph.  A general methodology was developed for analysis of factual material, the results of which proved that language and culture are sources for the construction of various types of discourse (artistic, political, and religious). The key narratives of each type of discourse reproduce the value con- stants and dominants of ethnic groups at various stages of civilizational and planetary development.  The concept of the monograph is the triad of LANGUAGE \u2013 CULTURE \u2013 DISCOURSE that is interpreted as an extremely complex synergistic continuum of an open type, which takes on material form with the participation of a Man, i.e. a representative of certain social communities and, at the same time, a generator of various types of speech, which ensures efficient communication of communication participants",

            "abstract": "\"This book focuses on biobased packaging materials as potential green materials to address environmental pollution from non-biodegradable packaging materials and reduce the dependency on petroleum-based packaging plastics for better sustainability. Divided into three sections, this book provides comprehensive coverage of biobased packaging materials. The first section of the book covers development and characterization, discussing different biobased materials, their preparation techniques and functional properties. Part two addresses environmental considerations surrounding the use of biobased packaging; while the third section considers the current market opportunities and challenges of biobased packaging materials as well as future market prospects. Topics covered include: Starch-based and protein-based packaging materials  Chitin/chitosan based films for packaging applications \u00b7Pectin based edible films for food packaging Nanocellulose composite films \u00b7Poly(lactic) acid modified films and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) films for food packaging Manufacturing of biobased packaging materials \u00b7Environmental advantages of biobased packaging materials  Reuse and recycling of biobased packaging products  Life Cycle Assessment Socio-economic impact, challenges and opportunities Current market for biobased packaging materials  Regulations for food packaging materials\"--",

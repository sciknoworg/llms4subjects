                "This volume offers a glimpse of the status of research in adaptive and learning systems in 1985. In recent years these areas have spawned a multiplicity of ideas so rapidly that the average research worker or practicing engineer is overwhelmed by the flood of information. The Yale Workshop on Applications of Adaptive Systems Theory was organized in 1979 to provide a brief respite from this deluge, wherein critical issues may be examined in a calm and collegial environment. The fourth of the series having been held in May 1985, it has now become well established as a biennial forum for the lively exchange of ideas in the ever changing domain of adaptive systems. The scope of this book is broad and ranges from theoretical investigations to practical applications. It includes twenty eight papers by leaders in the field, selected from the Pro\u00ad ceedings of the Fourth Yale Workshop and divided into five sections. I have provided a brief introduction to each section so that it can be read as a self-contained unit. The first section, devoted to adaptive control theory, suggests the intensity of activity in the field and reveals signs of convergence towards some common themes by workers with rather different moti\u00ad vation. Preliminary results concerning the reduced order model problem are dramatically changing the way we view the field and bringing it closer to other areas such as robust linear control where major advances have been recently reported.",

            "abstract": "This book shows developers and Oracle professionals how to build practical, non-trivial web applications using Oracle's rapid application development environment -- Application Express (APEX).  This third edition is revised to cover the new features and user interface experience found in APEX 20.  Interactive grids and form regions are two of the newer aspects of APEX covered in this edition.  The book is targeted at those who are new to APEX and just beginning to develop real projects for deployment, as well as those who are familiar with APEX and want to understand it better.  The book takes you through the development of a demo web application that illustrates the concepts all APEX programmers should know.  This book introduces the world of APEX properties, explaining the functionality supported by each page component as well as the techniques developers use to achieve that functionaltiy.  Topics include conditional formatting, user-customized reports, data entry forms, concurrency and lost updates, and security control.  Specific attention is given in the book to the thought process involved in choosing and assembling APEX components and features to deliver a specific result.  \"Understanding Oracle APEX 20 application development, 3rd edition\" is the ideal book to take you from an understanding of the individual pieces of APEX to an understanding of how those pieces are assembled into polished applications",

                "This text provides comprehensive coverage of fibers used in food formulations, starting with the understanding of their basic chemical structure and how they are present and organized in the cell wall structure, their physicochemical and functional properties, their impact on the digestive process and their role and preventive action against various chronic diseases including colon cancer. The book focuses on traditional and new fiber rich sources, incorporating an integrated approach in terms of the technological and engineering processes used to obtain and incorporate them in traditional foods, plus their characterization, extraction and modification. The study of processing conditions including the chemical, physical and enzymatic processes of fiber extraction and modification are also covered, including traditional and emerging processing technologies, plus the application of fibers in the development of new products and processes. Science and Technology of Fibers in Food Systems integrates knowledge of fibers from their basic structural and property aspects and the applications of these ingredients to extraction process analysis, modification and feasibility for use at the industry level. The chapters incorporate the physiological aspects related to the consumption of fiber for prevention of serious diseases. ."

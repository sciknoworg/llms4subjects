This new 4th edition includes brand new material on: New engine technologies and concepts Effects of engine speed on performance and emissions Fluid mechanics of intake and exhaust flow in engines Turbocharger and supercharger performance analysis Chemical kinetic modeling, reaction mechanisms, and emissions Advanced combustion processes including low temperature combustion Piston, ring and journal bearing friction analysis The Fourth edition expands the combined analytical and numerical approaches used successfully in the previous editions. Students and engineers are provided with an increased number of tools for applying the fundamental principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer to internal combustion engines. Each chapter includes MATLAB programs and examples showing how to perform detailed engineering computations. The chapters also have an increased number of homework problems with which the reader can gauge their progress and retention. All the software is ?open source? so that readers can see in detail how computational analysis and design of engines is performed. A companion website is also provided, offering access to the MATLAB computer programs\"--",

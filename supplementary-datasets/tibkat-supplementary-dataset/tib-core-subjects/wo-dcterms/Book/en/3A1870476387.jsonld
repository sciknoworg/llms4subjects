            "title": "The political thought of Anacharsis Cloots : a proponent of cosmopolitan republicanism in the french revolution",
            "abstract": "Historians have often either ignored Anacharsis Cloots (1755\u20131794) or considered him deranged because he claimed to be the \u2018orator of the human race\u2019 and devised a \u2018universal republic\u2019 based on the \u2018sovereignty of the human race\u2019. This book is the first comprehensive study of the entire body of Cloots\u2019s written works and political actions. By contextualizing them, the book non only rehabilitates Cloots as a political thinker worthy of consideration, but also argues that his political thought constitutes a specific branch of republicanism in the age of Atlantic revolutions: cosmopolitan republicanism. The introduction suggests how 18th-century French cosmopolitanism was a new philosophical tradition, but was composed of several themes, which the book then analyses in Cloots\u2019s writings. The first chapter provides a brief overview of his life. The second chapter explains why he called himself orator and wrote pamphlets, and why contemporary readers should not discard this as non-philosophical. Having established Cloots\u2019s writings as constituting a philosophical system, the following chapters explores it through the themes laid out in the introduction. First, the concept of reason and his understanding of science. Second, the paradigm of natural law and the role of nature in moral and political thought. Third, the conception of humanity and individuals in nature and society. Finally, republicanism and its principles. The last chapter summarizes the elements of Cloots\u2019s cosmopolitan republicanism and opens a research programme to other political thinkers in the age of Atlantic revolutions for historians and political theorists.",

            "abstract": "The Way Things Go contains a mix of poetry, art writing, and life writing about anticipatory grief, or mourning someone or something before it\u2019s gone. Each successive chapter in the book decreases in length by exactly one sentence, from a 71-sentence-long opening chapter, to a 70-sentence-long second chapter, to 69 sentences, 68 sentences, and so on down to 1 (a book-length Oulipian \u201cmelting snowball\u201d). This shrinking form enacts the book\u2019s concerns with loss, climate change, and the passage of time.  At the level of its content, however, The Way Things Go is not fatalistic. Its title comes from a cult classic 1987 Fischli and Weiss film, in which objects such as bags of trash, car tires, and oil drums knock into one another in a Rube Goldberg-esque chain reaction. Moving through both personal history (his sister\u2019s lupus and heroin addiction, his grandmother\u2019s experience as a Holocaust survivor) and more global concerns (the Sixth Mass Extinction, COVID-19, the war in Ukraine), Bury considers the disruptions that occur as \u201cthings go,\u201d as well as the continuity that remains. The book suggests that recent negotiations between optimism and pessimism with respect to the future reflect people\u2019s feelings of vulnerability, particularly people who are used to taking their life\u2019s stability for granted, in a world that seems increasingly precarious",

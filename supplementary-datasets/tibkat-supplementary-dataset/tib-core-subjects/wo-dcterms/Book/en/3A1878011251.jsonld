            "abstract": "The objective of this report is to make recommendations for the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica (GoCD) for the formulation of a country-specific comprehensive disaster risk financing (DRF) strategy, based on the assessment of the legislative, financial management, fiscal, and insurance market environment in Dominica. The key activities of the present review are twofold: (a) to review the existing data that would inform the quantification of Dominica's contingent liabilities to natural hazards, as well as current practices in DRF and (b) to conduct a review of the existing public financial management (PFM) and insurance market with respect to DRF by reviewing laws, regulations, practices, existing protocols and systems, and macroeconomic conditions. This report is envisioned to be used as a planning tool for the potential development of a comprehensive DRF strategy that would equip the Ministry of Finance and Investment (MoF) with information and instruments to manage contingent liabilities posed by natural hazards. This report presents recommendations for a cost-effective DRF strategy in Dominica, drawing heavily on international experience, country-specific information, and similar conditions in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) with limited fiscal space. These complementary resources for a national DRF strategy are based on a preliminary fiscal risk analysis and a review of the current budget management of disasters in Dominica. The report benefits from the international experience of the World Bank and the approach outlined in its operational DRF and insurance framework, which has assisted several countries worldwide, including in the Caribbean (Belize, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Jamaica, and so on) in the design and implementation of sovereign catastrophe risk financing strategies. This report tailors the approach to the institutional, social, and economic context of Dominica",

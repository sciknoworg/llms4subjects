            "abstract": "\"Intermediate Solid Mechanics represents a concise yet comprehensive treatment of the fundamentals of the mechanics of solids. It is intended as a textbook for an upper-division undergraduate course in solid mechanics, which comes after an introductory strength of materials course in mechanical, aerospace, civil, structural, and materials engineering. It can also serve as a textbook or supplemental reading for an introductory graduate course in solid mechanics, being particularly well suited for Master of Engineering Programs. The book consists of two parts. Part I comprises five chapters devoted to the basic concepts of the theory, which includes the analysis of stress, strain, generalized Hooke's law, and the formulation of the boundary-value problems in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. Part II comprises six chapters on the application of the general theory from Part I to solve a variety of boundary-value problems of solid mechanics, and two chapters on energy methods and failure criteria. Two-dimensional plane stress and plane strain problems, antiplane shear, torsion of prismatic rods, and bending of beams by transverse loads are covered in detail. This is followed by an introduction to contact mechanics, energy analysis with application to structural mechanics, and the formulation of failure criteria for brittle and ductile materials. To facilitate the understanding of the theoretical foundation of the subject and its application, numerous solved examples and exercise problems and included throughout the book. There are also ten representative problems at the end of each of the thirteen chapters, which are intended for homework exercise. Marko V. Lubarda received his B.S. degree in Physics from the University of California, San Diego in 2006 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science and Engineering from U.C. San Diego in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Since 2013, he has been an assistant professor in the Faculty of Polytechnics at the University of Donja Gorica, Montenegro, and since 2014 a visiting lecturer in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department of U.C. San Diego. He was also an invited visiting assistant professor at the Institut Jean Lamour, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France. He is the recipient of the Young Researcher Award from the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the Outstanding Young Scientist Award from the Montenegrin Ministry of Science. Vlado A.

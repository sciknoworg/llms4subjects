            "abstract": "\"Numerical calculations for process engineering using Excel/VBA provides numerical treatment of process engineering problems with VBA programming and Excel spreadsheets. The problems are solving material & energy balances, optimising reactors and modelling multiple-factor processes. The book includes both basic and advanced codes for numerical calculations. The basic methods were presented in different variations tailored to particular applications. Some macros are combined with each other's to solve engineering problems. Examples include combining the bisection method and binary search to optimise an implicit correlation, combining golden section search with Euler's method to optimise a reactor, and combining bisection code and Euler's method to solve steady-state heat distribution. The text also includes non-conventional examples such as harmony search and network analysis. The examples include solutions to common engineering problems such as adiabatic flame temperature, plug flow reactor conversion, batch reactor, heat diffusion and pinch analysis of heat exchanger networks. The VBA codes are presented with mathematical equations and flowcharts, enabling the audience to adopt the solutions to different problems. The book contains many demonstrations of numerical techniques to guide users. It also includes useful summaries of VBA commands/functions and Excel-predefined functions accessible in VBA. While the book is developed with a primary aim for undergraduate students, the book is a helpful resource for postgraduate students and engineers\"--",

                "Why do financial crises occur under some IMF programs? When does state-perpetrated repression increase in the aftermath of such financial crises? Mukherjee and Yadav provide a compelling theoretical answer to these crucial questions, moving beyond earlier work to examine when a financial crisis occurs in states assisted by the IMF and how this leads to repression of human rights. They analyze a global sample of developing states and carefully examine the Brazil, India, and Turkey cases to evaluate their claims. The IMF, Financial Crisis and Repression of Human Rights is an important book that should be widely read by scholars and policy practitioners. -Quan Li, Professor of Political Science, The Bush School of Government & Public Service,Texas A&M University This book seeks to answer a number of key questions about the relationship between the IMF, developing states and the impact of financial crises on human rights abuses, including: Why do some but not other IMF-assisted developing states experience the joint outbreak of currency and sudden reversal crises under the Fund\u2019s program?; What are some of the short-term political ramifications of such crises?; Why do human rights violation by governments increase sharply in the wake of twin currency and sudden reversal crisis in some but not all crisis-affected countries? Bumba Mukherjee is Professor of the Department of Political Science at Penn State University, United States. Vineeta Yadav is Associate Professor of the Department of Political Science at Penn State University, United States."

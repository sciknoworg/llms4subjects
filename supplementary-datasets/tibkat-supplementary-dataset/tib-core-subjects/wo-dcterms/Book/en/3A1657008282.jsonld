            "abstract": "This collection of science fiction writings by Jayant V. Narlikar offers readers a unique glimpse into the world-famous Indian astrophysicist\u2019s vivid and highly imaginative concepts and stories.   The fictional material comprises a witty short story (\"The rare idol of Ganesha\") that cleverly explores the possible consequences of a mirror-symmetric individual in the context of cricket test match performances, as well as the fast-paced, gripping science fiction thriller \"The return of Vaman\": when an alien container is unearthed by a crew of scientists, the enormous potential technological applications of its contents bring various criminal elements on the scene - but when the real danger becomes apparent it is almost too late to save humanity.   Last but not least, the book provides readers with extensive insights into the genesis and scientific background of the fictional material presented in this volume, along with an autobiographical account of the author\u2019s life-long interest in science fiction and his contributions to the genre.

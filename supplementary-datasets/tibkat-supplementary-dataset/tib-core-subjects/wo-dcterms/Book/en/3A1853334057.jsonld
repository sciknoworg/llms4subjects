            "abstract": "Why write? Why ask a reader to give their time and attention to your words? How can writing be more than narcissism and self-aggrandizement?  These questions were ones that the writer and naturalist Barry Lopez asked at the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference in the summer of 2000, and they are questions at the heart of About That Life, a meditation on matters of living, making, and seeking.  While Lopez is best known for such works of nonfiction as the National Book Award-winning Arctic Dreams, Matthew Cheney brings our attention to the many works of short fiction that Lopez published throughout his life, demonstrating how they fit within Lopez\u2019s sense of ethical aesthetics. That sense is then set alongside the work of San Francisco\u2019s New Narrative writers, insights from David Hinton\u2019s translations of Tu Fu, the story of community arising around a pottery kiln in western Oregon, the beauties and contradictions of S\u014detsu Yanagi\u2019s The Unknown Craftsman, and the implications of the right-wing mob attack on the U.S. Capitol \u2013 an event that occurred on what would have been Barry Lopez\u2019s 76th birthday.  Through a collage of memoir, history, literary criticism, philosophy, aesthetic theory, and creative writing exercises, About That Life wonders how we might live and dream in a world that seems ever more cruel and destructive",

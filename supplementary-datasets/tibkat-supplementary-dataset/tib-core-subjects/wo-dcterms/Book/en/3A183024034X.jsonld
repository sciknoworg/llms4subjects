            "title": "Ghana Country Climate and Development Report",
            "abstract": "Ghana has achieved major development gains over the past three decades, but progress has slowed and there are causes for concern going forward. Ghana sought to fuel its development by leveraging markets, but debt sustainability is a concern, compounded by crises. Ghana's economic and human development is also vulnerable to climate change and climate-related shocks. While climate change cannot be solved by any single country, local actions can help manage physical and transition risks as well as bring large opportunities. This report explores the ways in which Ghana can pursue its development objectives while considering the challenges of climate change and the opportunities from the transition. It sets the stage in chapter 1 by documenting the various ways in which climate and development interact in Ghana, emphasizing that climate action can support development. Chapter 2 reviews Ghana's climate commitments and institutional readiness to carry them out. Chapter 3 lays out concrete actions that Ghana can consider to boost its resilience and productivity in key sectors while reducing its emissions and associated externalities. Chapter 4 models some of these investments and policies to assess their overall economic and social effects and explores financing options as well as ways to crowd in the private sector. Chapter 5 concludes by laying out priorities for the government to consider that are achievable and can yield development and climate payoffs simultaneously",

            "abstract": "Understanding US/UK government and politics is a further volume in the Understanding Politics series. It is written specifically for A2 students and covers the comparative dimension of advanced level study. It closely follows the syllabuses of the main examination boards, being especially helpful for those requiring a direct comparison between the two political systems. Clear and accessible in style, it offers invaluable insights into the similarities and differences between British and American politics. These are summarised in useful boxes at the end of each chapter, where there are also details of relevant websites and likely examination questions. The book begins by examining the setting against which government and politics operates in Britain and the United States, noting aspects of the history and social structure of each country before exploring the concept of political culture. The underlying ideas and values of British and American people are compared, and the book goes on to analyse the constitution and the protection of rights, before considering the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government in detail. In addition, the nature of American federalism and moves towards federal devolution in the United Kingdom are assessed. Political parties, the media and elections, pressure groups and voting are all extensively covered, with some concluding thoughts on the current condition of democracy in Britain and the United States. This is the first book to attempt the task of looking at government in the UK and the US in comparative terms. It offers students the chance to boost their knowledge and understanding of the two political systems and provides the basis for a strong comparative response to any likely A2 question",

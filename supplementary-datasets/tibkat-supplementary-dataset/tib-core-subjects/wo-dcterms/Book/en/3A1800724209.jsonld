            "abstract": "The first in-depth exploration of Shakespeare\u2019s representations of climate and the skyOffers an all-encompassing approach on early modern climate in ShakespeareRedefines the notion of \u2018climate\u2019 as Shakespeare\u2019s contemporaries understood itSuggests new hermeneutic tracks to understand Shakespeare\u2019s major comedies and tragediesProbes environmental issues in Shakespeare\u2019s plays and, in doing so, echoes major concerns of the present timeWhile ecocritical approaches to literary texts receive more and more attention, climate-related issues remain fairly neglected, particularly in the field of Shakespeare studies. This monograph explores the importance of weather and changing skies in early modern England while acknowledging the fact that traditional representations and religious beliefs still fashioned people\u2019s relations to meteorological phenomena. At the same time, a growing number of literati stood against determinism and defended free will, thereby insisting on the ability to act upon celestial forces. Sophie Chiari argues that Shakespeare reconciles the scholarly approaches of his time with popular views rooted in superstition and promotes a sensitive, pragmatic understanding of climatic events. Taking into account the influence of classical thought, each of the book\u2019s seven chapters addresses a different play where sky-related topics are crucial and considers the way climatic phenomena were presented on stage and how they came to shape the production and reception of Shakespeare\u2019s drama",

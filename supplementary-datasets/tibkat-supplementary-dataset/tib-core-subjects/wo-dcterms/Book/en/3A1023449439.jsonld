                "This important book addresses the broader legal, policy and regulatory issues confronting the international community in its search for effective methodologies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. New threats must always be met with new regulatory and compliance approaches. Alongside an original introduction to the area, which critically examines the 2012 revision to the Financial Action Task Force, the editor has selected key papers that focus on compliance perspectives, in assessing the task, including work examining the recent shift from a rule-based to a risk-based approach. This book is an essential source of reference for anyone interested in this dynamic field",

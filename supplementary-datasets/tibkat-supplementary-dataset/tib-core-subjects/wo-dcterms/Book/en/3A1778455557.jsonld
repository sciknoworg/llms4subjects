            "abstract": "Kill the Overseer! profiles and problematizes digital games that depict Atlantic slavery and \u201cgamify\u201d slave resistance. In videogames emphasizing plantation labor, the player may choose to commit small acts of resistance like tool-breaking or working slowly. Others dramatically stage the slave\u2019s choice to flee enslavement and journey northward, and some depict outright violent revolt against the master and his apparatus. In this work, Sarah Juliet Lauro questions whether the reduction of a historical enslaved person to a digital commodity in games such as Mission US, Assassin\u2019s Creed, and Freedom Cry ought to trouble us as a further commodification of slavery\u2019s victims, or whether these interactive experiences offer an empowering commemoration of the history of slave resistance. Forerunners is a thought-in-process series of breakthrough digital works. Written between fresh ideas and finished books, Forerunners draws on scholarly work initiated in notable blogs, social media, conference plenaries, journal articles, and the synergy of academic exchange. This is gray literature publishing: where intense thinking, change, and speculation take place in scholarship",

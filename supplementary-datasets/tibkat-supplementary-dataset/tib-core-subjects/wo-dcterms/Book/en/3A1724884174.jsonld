            "title": "Costing Adaptation through Local Institutions : Synthesis Report",
            "abstract": "The Costing Adaptation through Local Institutions (CALI) study aims to highlight how adaptation by households to climate change and climate variability is shaped by institutions, and how governments, through local institutions, can support adaptation that addresses the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable households. The main objective of the study is to provide recommendations regarding adaptation options for households in rural regions and facilitate the necessary institutional support. The methodology of the study draws on past adaptation experiences, particularly for vulnerable groups in different fragile ecological contexts. It uses participatory approaches to assess the costs of different adaptation strategies used by such groups. In this synthesis report, the analytical results from the three country case studies are presented and compared. Among the adopted strategies in the three cases, some were similar, while others were country-specific. The report describes some of the institutional, socioeconomic, and political differences that contributed to the individual or communal adaptation strategies among the countries. These country comparisons make it possible to present a number of policy recommendations that provide a better insight on how future interventions might be more effectively targeted. The results of this study confirm the view that it is important to place greater emphasis on integrated approaches to development. A focus on only a single issue will most likely not have the envisaged results and will in the end lead to higher costs. Several constraints ranging from constraints on a household, village, regional, or national level prevent households from successfully improving their livelihoods and preparing adequately for changing climate variability",

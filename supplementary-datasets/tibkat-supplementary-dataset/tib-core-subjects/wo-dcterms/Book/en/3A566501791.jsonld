            "abstract": "This paper draws from experience in many countries, but focuses in detail on protected areas in parts of Kenya, South Africa, and the Californias (a binational region that includes parts of Mexico and the USA). Brief notes illustrate special problems and/or innovative solutions from Australia, Brazil, Cape Verde, China, and Kiribati. Urbanization that affects protected areas takes several forms: urban sprawl, ribbon development, urban intensification and infill, coalescing large-scale megapolitan\u02ba regions, tourism developments, second-home and retirement developments, growing gateway communities, growing settlements within protected areas, informal settlements, and transboundary urbanization. Impacts of urbanization on protected areas include: fragmentation of habitat, edge effects, pollution, too little or too much water, human-wildlife conflict, introduction of exotic invasive species, fire along the wildland-urban interface, crime, and minor problems with urban visitors. The world is urbanizing at a rapid rate. In 1950, about 30% of the world's population lived in cities. This figure is now estimated to be 50% and is projected to rise to 61% by 2030. However, there are marked differences among world regions. Most countries in the Americas, Europe, and Oceania are highly urbanized; most of those in Africa and Asia much less so. Contrary to a commonly held belief, people living in megacities\u02ba (those with 10 million inhabitants or more) account for less that 4% of the world's population. Some of the fastest growing cities have relatively small populations. Protected areas can be affected by very small, as well as larger, human settlements. There are ecologically sensitive places where even the growth of a village could have devastating impacts ...",

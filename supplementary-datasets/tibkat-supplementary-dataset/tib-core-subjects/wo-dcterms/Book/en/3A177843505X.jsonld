            "abstract": "When food is ingested, it remains in the mouth for a short period of time. Although this period is brief compared to the total food nutrient digestion and absorption time, it is crucially important, as it is the first step in digestion. It is also very important that, while the food is in the mouth, it is perceived by the senses and then a decision is made on swallowing. Oral sensory perception is an integrative response, which is generated in very short time (normally a few seconds) from complex information gathered from multiple sources during mastication and swallowing. Consequently, food oral processing studies include many orientations. This Special Issue brings together a small range of studies with a diversity of approaches that provide good examples of the complexity and multidisciplinarity of the subject",

                "This book offers a strengths-based, family-focused approach to improving the educational performance and school experience of struggling Black and Latino students. The book discusses educational challenges faced by low-income families of color and the different strengths within Black and Latino family life that can affect these challenges. It focuses building on these strengths within the children\u2019s home environments that can serve as a foundation for subsequent learning. The chapters describe a wide range of family practices and beliefs, including development of interventions to support families that promote early language and literacy, early mathematics, and social skills. The chapters also present quantitative and/or qualitative studies using a strengths-based approach to parents\u2019 socialization of their children\u2019s early academic skills. Topics featured in this book include: Latino and Black parental resources, investments, and beliefs. Academic socialization in the homes of Black and Latino preschool children. Development of culturally-informed interventions to promote children\u2019s school readiness skills. Family-school partnerships as a tool for improving educational opportunities. Directions for future research. Academic Socialization of Young Black and Latino Children is a must-have resource for researchers, educators, clinicians and related professionals, and graduate students in diverse fields including education, developmental and school psychology, family studies, counseling psychology and social work, and sociology of culture",

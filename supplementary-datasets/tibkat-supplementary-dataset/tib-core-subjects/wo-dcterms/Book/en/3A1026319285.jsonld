                "Entrepreneurship is a creative practice with tremendous impact, but how does one effectively teach entrepreneurs to engage in this sometimes tumultuous and risk-laden process? A traditional stand and lecture approach to teaching this complex subject does not always suffice, and many professors are finding that students benefit more from hands-on experiences. By engaging and acting, students can own their knowledge and progress beyond an intellectual understanding of the subject. This book offers sixty-five experiential exercises, each designed to be applicable to the entrepreneurial process. These cross-disciplinary exercises vary in scale from single-class activities to course projects or yearlong capstones. Learning objectives are clearly defined so that instructors can incorporate the book's exercises, games, simulations and demonstrations into their syllabi.^Whether classes are basic, intermediate or advanced, instructors can use the exercises to engage their students and help them develop as creatively-minded entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship professors seeking experiential exercises to incorporate into their teaching will find this book of value.

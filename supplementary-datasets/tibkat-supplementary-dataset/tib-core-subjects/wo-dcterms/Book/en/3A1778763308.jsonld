            "abstract": "In this monograph, Anne Tiernan and Jennifer Menzies capably chart the often hazardous terrain of the \u2018caretaker period\u2019 that ensues from the time an election is called until a new government is formed. This is a landscape fraught with political and administrative dangers \u2013 particularly for public servants who are required to \u2018mind the shop\u2019 and keep the basic machinery of government going. The conventions represent an historical accretion of custom, practice and rules, often leavened with uncertainty. In tackling their subject, Tiernan and Menzies draw upon their shared past experiences as public servants and ministerial \u2018staffers\u2019 as well as the highest standards of academic scholarship \u2013 this is a \u2018must read\u2019 for politicians, public servants and students of government",

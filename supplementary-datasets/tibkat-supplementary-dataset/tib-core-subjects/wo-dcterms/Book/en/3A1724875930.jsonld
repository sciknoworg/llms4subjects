            "abstract": "Uganda is urbanizing rapidly. If not proactively managed, Uganda will miss a major opportunity for structural transformation. The purpose of this report is to provide Ugandan policymakers with economic analyses on the role of Greater Kampala in achieving Uganda's economic goals outlined in Vision 2040 and the actions needed to unlock the city's economic potential. This report drills down into the case of Greater Kampala and outlines the metropolitan's main challenges to promoting economic development and recommending areas for government action. Following the introductory section, Section 2 profiles Greater Kampala's economic strengths and weaknesses as well as outlines the vital role it plays in Uganda's economy. The section will show that Greater Kampala is not generating enough jobs in the value-added sectors, like manufacturing, for sustained economic development and concludes by identifying promising sectors which have the greatest potential to create productive jobs. This report then argues that there are three focus areas which are crucial to Greater Kampala's future economic development: i) Built environment and; ii) Business constraints affecting the tradable sector. Section 2 evaluates Greater Kampala's built environment, assessing the city's urban form and infrastructure and how they impact on firm competitiveness. This section concludes with practical suggestions for the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area stakeholders and identifies opportunities to better manage Greater Kampala's urbanization. Section 3 addresses the business constraints which Kampala's formal firms face. This section discusses how governments can best engage businesses to address barriers to firm growth including access to finance, taxation and skills. The report concludes by outlining all recommendations in a sequenced plan",

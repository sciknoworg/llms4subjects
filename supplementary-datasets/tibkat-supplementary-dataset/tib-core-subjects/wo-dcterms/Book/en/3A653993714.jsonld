                "Critically acclaimed since its inception, Advances in Librarianship continues to be the essential reference source for developments in the field of libraries and library science. Articles published in the series have won national prizes, such as the Blackwell North America Scholarship Award for the outstanding 1994 monograph, article, or original paper in the field of acquisitions, collection, development, and related areas of resource development. All areas of public, college, university, primary and secondary schools, and special libraries are given up-to-date, critical analysis by experts engaged in the practice of librarianship, in teaching, and in research. Throughout all of the chapters of this 25th volume of Advances in Librarianship runs a thread of technology that is now embraced by libraries of every nation and type. It is clear that libraries are sharing technological developments everywhere in the world, from Russia to New Zealand. Not only are rare book librarians using technology but funding agencies are supporting its spread as well",

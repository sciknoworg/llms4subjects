                "\"The aim of this book is to handle different application problems of science and engineering using expert Artificial Neural Network (ANN). As such, the book starts with basics of ANN along with different mathematical preliminaries with respect to algebraic equations. Then it addresses ANN based methods for solving different algebraic equations viz. polynomial equations, diophantine equations, transcendental equations, system of linear and nonlinear equations, eigenvalue problems etc. which are the basic equations to handle the application problems mentioned in the content of the book. Although there exist various methods to handle these problems, but sometimes those may be problem dependent and may fail to give a converge solution with particular discretization. Accordingly, ANN based methods have been addressed here to solve these problems. Detail ANN architecture with step by step procedure and algorithm have been included. Different example problems are solved with respect to various application and mathematical problems. Convergence plots and/or convergence tables of the solutions are depicted to show the efficacy of these methods. It is worth mentioning that various application problems viz. Bakery problem, Power electronics applications, Pole placement, Electrical Network Analysis, Structural engineering problem etc. have been solved using the ANN based methods\"--Publisher's website"

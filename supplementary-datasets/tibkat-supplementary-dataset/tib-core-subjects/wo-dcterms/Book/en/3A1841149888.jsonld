            "abstract": "Focusing on the Anglophone Caribbean, The Making of a Caribbean Avant-Garde describes the rise and gradual consolidation of the visual arts avant-garde, which came to local and international attention in the 1990s. The book is centered on the critical and aesthetic strategies employed by this avant-garde to repudiate the previous generation\u2019s commitment to modernism and anti-colonialism. In three sections, it highlights the many converging factors, which have pushed this avant-garde to the forefront of the region\u2019s contemporary scene, and places it all in the context of growing dissatisfaction with the post-colonial state and its cultural policies. This generational transition has manifested itself not only in a departure from \u201ctraditional\u201d in favor of \u201cnew\u201d media (i.e., installation, performance, and video rather than painting and sculpture), but also in the advancement of a \u201cpostnationalist postmodernism,\u201d which reaches for diasporic and cosmopolitan frames of reference. Section one outlines the features of a preceding \u201cCreole modernism\u201d and explains the different guises of postnationalism in the region\u2019s contemporary art. In section two, its [PKM1] momentum is connected to the proliferation of independent art spaces and transnational networks, which connect artists across and beyond the region and open up possibilities unavailable to earlier generations. Section three demonstrates the impact of this conceptual and organizational evolution on the selection and exhibition of Caribbean art in the metropole.

            "abstract": "We understand very little about the billions of dollars that flow throughout the world from migrants back to their home countries. In this rigorous and illuminating work, Matt Bakker, an economic sociologist, examines how these migrant remittances\u2014the resources of some of the world\u2019s least affluent people\u2014have come to be seen in recent years as a fundamental contributor to development in the migrant sending states of the global south. This book analyzes how the connection between remittances and development was forged through the concrete political and intellectual practices of policy entrepreneurs within a variety of institutional settings, from national government agencies and international development organizations to nongovernmental policy foundations and think tanks.  \u201cMigrating into Financial Markets offers a much-needed interpretation of the institutions that frame migration. In this fascinating account, Bakker shows how, unable to come up with a political solution to large-scale migration, Mexico and the United States recast migrants as private actors of economic and social development.\u201d  -RUB\u00c9N HERN\u00c1NDEZ-LE\u00d3N, coauthor of Skills of the \u201cUnskilled\u201d: Work and Mobility among Mexican Migrants  \u201cContrasting governments\u2019 developmentalist rhetoric with the way their policies are actually designed and implemented, this thoughtful study makes an important contribution to a key debate in contemporary development policy.\u201d  -GAY SEIDMAN, Martindale Bascom Professor of Sociology, University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison  \u201cBakker offers a cautionary tale of how international policy entrepreneurs\u2019 commitment to an ideology of market fundamentalism reduced their approach to addressing the human rights of migrants in the post-9/11 world to lowering the costs of wire transfers and banking the un-banked.\u201d  -DAVID SPENER, Professor of Sociology, Trinity University and author of Clandestine Crossings: Migrants and Coyotes on the Texas-Mexico Border  MATT BAKKER is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Marymount University",

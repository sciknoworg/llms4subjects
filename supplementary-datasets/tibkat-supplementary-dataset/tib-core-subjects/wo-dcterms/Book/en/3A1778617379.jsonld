            "abstract": "The book contains six chapters. The use of the progressive regressive strategy for biometrical authentication through the use of human gait and face images was investigated. A new lossy image compression technique that uses singular value decomposition and wavelet difference reduction technique was proposed. The best wavelet packet based selection algorithm and its application in image denoising was discussed. The scaling factor threshold estimator in different color models using a discrete wavelet transform for steganographic algorithms was presented. The extraction of features appearing in current signal using wavelet analysis when there is rotor fault of eccentricity and broken rotor bar was debated. The application of the empirical wavelet transform for seismic anomalies detection in ultralow-frequency geomagnetic signals was illustrated",

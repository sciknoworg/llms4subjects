            "abstract": "Image Fusion is an important branch of information fusion, and it is also an important technology for image understanding and computer vision. The fusion process is to merging different images into one to get more accurate description for the scene. The original images for image fusion are always obtained by several different image sensors, or the same sensor in different operating modes. The fused image can provide more effective information for further image processing, such as image segmentation, object detection and recognition. Image fusion is a new study field which combined with many different disciplines, such as sensors, signal processing, image processing, computer and artificial intelligence. In the past two decades, a large number of research literatures appear. This book is edited based on these research results, and many research scholars give a great help to this book",

The next section, The Nuclear Challenge, assesses Seoul\u2019s and Pyongyang\u2019s foreign policy options within ever-changing domestic and international circumstances \u2013 under the looming nuclear shadow. The final section, Partnering with Russia, presents an unprecedented first-hand account of Seoul\u2019s and Pyongyang\u2019s dealings with Moscow. The book provides a unique account with expertise from Russia, one of the four states directly involved in Korean affairs, providing insights on domestic and diplomatic decision-making of the two Korean states and international efforts to resolve the nuclear issue.

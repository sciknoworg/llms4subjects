                "This book has been brought out in remembrance of Prof. DK Paul who has contributed immensely to the domain of Earthquake Engineering and Earthquake Disaster Mitigation. Prof. Paul was a leading authority in this field and has made significant contributions in Earthquake Resistant Analysis as well as Design of various special structures, which resulted in earthquake disaster reduction in India. This book comprises recent diverse topics on earthquake engineering and disaster mitigation. The chapters are of interest to readers, as the different chapters will elaborate popular topics on various aspects of earthquake engineering and disaster management. Substantial research work has been carried out in the domain of earthquake engineering for understanding the underlying phenomena as well as to attain relevance in mitigating disaster. Under overarching umbrella of earthquake engineering and technology, systematic categorization of various ongoing research details pertaining to earthquake engineering and disaster management has been introduced in this book. The chapters appended in this book not only comprise detailed understanding of the responses of soil and structure under the implications of seismic loading but also address some of the innovative ways to cater the implications of severe loading conditions. Further, this book also introduces specific case studies pertaining to various regions of India, which will aid the readers to attain a detailed idea about the seismic aspects of those regions in order to undergo further research. This also aids in mitigating potential hazards due to future earthquakes in terms of taking proper remedial measures. The appended chapters comprise in-depth knowledge about several aspects on earthquake engineering such as nonlinear seismic response of both superstructures and embedded structures, design spectrum, amplification prediction, simulation with the aid of stochastic approaches, seismic performance of structures as well as earthquake induced disasters. The aforementioned wide-ranging topics pertaining to earthquake engineering and disaster management aid in substantial development in futuristic research and employ innovative ways to cater the needs of mitigating disasters. All the chapters consist of proper illustrations and tables which makes it easy to comprehend the vital concepts for the readers as well as aids in implementing new aspects in the field in addition to classroom learning. .",

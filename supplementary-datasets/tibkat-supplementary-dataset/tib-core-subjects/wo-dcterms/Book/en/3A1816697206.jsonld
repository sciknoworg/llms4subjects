            "abstract": "Tashkent's strategic regional position and its projected growth, combined with the natural and human-made hazards it faces, will bring both opportunities and challenges to the city. One of Central Asia's most populous and dynamic cities, Tashkent is the administrative and financial center of Uzbekistan, and its business continuity is essential for the country. The city contributes 16.2 percent of national GDP and is the largest urban market for goods and services in the central Asian region. Tashkent has strong transport, logistics and retail sectors coupled with a significant industrial heritage. Its advantageous location on the transit routes between China and Europe and with neighboring Kazakhstan, combined with declining restrictions on cross-border movements of goods and people, contribute to the increase in economic activity and the growing inflow of visitors both domestic and international. Tashkent has the unique opportunity to be the first city in Central Asia to develop an urban resilience strategy and investment program. Cities around the world are developing resilience strategies to enhance their resilience to local and global shocks and stresses. This report is intended to reinforce Tashkent's potential to be the first city in Central Asia to develop a resilience strategy and through its implementation become a role-model to other cities in the region as well as join other cities globally that are also leading the way in enhancing urban resilience",

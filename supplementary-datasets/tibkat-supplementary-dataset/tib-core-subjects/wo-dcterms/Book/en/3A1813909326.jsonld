            "abstract": "\"Plastic pollution is a growing environmental problem that is attracting increasing interest across society, from academics to the general public. A significant factor in the wide public interest in plastics is its visibility; present throughout urban and rural environments, washing up on beaches and even visible from space. However, 'invisible' microplastics and nanoplastics are also an issue. With growing plastic production and usage, plastic waste within the environment will continue to increase. This increased input along with its persistence leads to accumulation and increasing ecosystem exposure, with as-yet unknown consequences. This book brings together a collection of chapters written by world-leading experts in environmental plastic pollution inputs, fate, effects and solutions. It provides an accessible overview of the current scientific understanding, future implications and key considerations for the management and mitigation of plastic waste within the world's oceans\"--",

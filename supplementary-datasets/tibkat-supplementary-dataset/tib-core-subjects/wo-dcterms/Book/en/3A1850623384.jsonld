                "When it comes to managing cybersecurity in an organization, most organizations tussle with basic foundational components. This practitioner\u2019s guide lays down those foundational components, with real client examples and pitfalls to avoid. A plethora of cybersecurity management resources are available\u2014many with sound advice, management approaches, and technical solutions\u2014but few with one common theme that pulls together management and technology, with a focus on executive oversight. Author Ryan Leirvik helps solve these common problems by providing a clear, easy-to-understand, and easy-to-deploy \"playbook\" for a cyber risk management approach applicable to your entire organization. This second edition provides tools and methods in a straight-forward, practical manner to guide the management of a cybersecurity program. Expanded sections include the critical integration of cyber risk management into enterprise risk management, the important connection between a Software Bill of Materials and Third-party Risk Programs, and additional \"how to\" tools and material for mapping frameworks to controls. Praise for Understand, Manage, and Measure Cyber Risk What lies ahead of you in the pages of this book? Clean practicality, not something that just looks good on paper\u2014brittle and impractical when exposed to the real world. I prize flexibility and simplicity instead of attempting to have answers for everything and the rigidity that results. This simplicity is what I find valuable within Ryan's book. Tim Collyer, Motorola Solutions It seems that I have found a kindred spirit\u2014a builder who has worked with a wide variety of client CISOs on their programs, gaining a deep understanding of how a successful and sustainable program should be constructed. Ryan's cyber work in the US Department of Defense, his McKinsey & Company consulting, and his advisory and survey work with IANS give him a unique global view of our shared passion. Nicholas J. Mankovich, PhD, MS, CISPP.",

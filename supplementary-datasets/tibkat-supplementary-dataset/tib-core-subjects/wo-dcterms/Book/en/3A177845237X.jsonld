            "title": "Symmetry and Fluid Mechanics",
            "abstract": "Since the 1980s, attention has increased in the research of fluid mechanics due to its wide application in industry and phycology. Major advances have occurred in the modeling of key topics such Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, nanoparticles, thermal management, and physiological fluid phenomena in biological systems, which have been published in this Special Issue on symmetry and fluid mechanics for Symmetry. Although, this book is not a formal textbook, it will be useful for university teachers, research students, and industrial researchers and for overcoming the difficulties that occur when considering the nonlinear governing equations. For such types of equations, obtaining an analytic or even a numerical solution is often more difficult. This book addresses this challenging job by outlining the latest techniques. In addition, the findings of the simulation are logically realistic and meet the standard of sufficient scientific value",

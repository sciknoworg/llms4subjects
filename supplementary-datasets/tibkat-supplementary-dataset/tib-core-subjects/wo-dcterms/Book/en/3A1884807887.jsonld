                "How do international students and alumni contribute to development in their countries of origin? Is the development effect larger when students return to their countries of origin directly after completing their studies and become involved locally there, or can they also support the development of their country of origin if they remain abroad after their studies and contribute their knowledge and capital to the development process of their country of origin via transnational networks? This question is examined in the case of the German scholarship program of the Catholic Academic Foreigner Service (KAAD) in five countries of different developing regions: Georgia, Ghana, Indonesia, Colombia and Palestinian territories. The authors Dr. Sascha Krannich is a research associate at the Institute for the History of Medicine at the Justus Liebig University of Giessen with a focus on migration, human rights and global health. He is also a member of the Research Group on Migration and Human Rights (FGMM) at the Justus Liebig University of Giessen. Dr. Uwe Hunger is Professor of Political Science with a focus on migration at the University of Applied Sciences Fulda and Private Lecturer at the Institute for Political Science at M\u00fcnster University, Germany. This book is a translation of an original German edition. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation."

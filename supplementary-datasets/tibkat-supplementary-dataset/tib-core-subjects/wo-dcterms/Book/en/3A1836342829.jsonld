The authors are all employed at or connected to the arts education at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences Education (HSD) at Stockholm University, Sweden. The book includes descriptions of different research practices such as research by professors and senior lecturers, post docs as well as the reflective writings of teaching personnel. The chapters have all gone through a double-blind peer-review process",

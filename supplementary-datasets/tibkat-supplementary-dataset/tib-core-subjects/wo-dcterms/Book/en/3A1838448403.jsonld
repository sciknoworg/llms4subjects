                "This book brings together international research on school teachers\u2019, and university lecturers\u2019 uses of digital technology to enhance teaching and learning in mathematics. It includes contributions that address theoretical, methodological, and practical challenges for the field with the research lens trained on the perspectives of teachers and teaching. As countries around the world move to integrate digital technologies in classrooms, this book collates research perspectives and experiences that offer valuable insights, in particular concerning the trajectories of development of teachers\u2019 digital skills, knowledge and classroom practices. Via app: download the SN More Media app for free, scan a link with play button and access the videos directly on your smartphone or tablet. Professor Alison Clark-Wilson works at the Institute of Education, University College London. Her research spans aspects of designing, implementing, and evaluating educational digital technologies with a particular interest in mathematics education. More specifically, she researches the more dynamic mathematical technologies alongside teachers\u2019 professional trajectories as they come to know and use such technologies. Beyond mathematics, Alison has extensive experience of working with governments, civil society organisations and industry partners on initiatives that aim to bridge research knowledge with educational technology product design and evaluation processes. Professor Ornella Robutti works in the Mathematics department \u201cG. Peano\u201d at the University of Torino. Her fields of research are students\u2019 cognitive processes during mathematical activities; teaching mathematics within technological environments; teachers\u2019 work as individuals and in communities, when teaching mathematics, when learning in professional development programs, and when designing tasks for students; meanings of mathematical objects in institutional and social contexts; mathematics students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 identities; boundary objects and boundary crossing between communities. Professor Nathalie Sinclair is a Distinguished University Professor in the Faculty of Education at Simon Fraser University. She is the founding and current editor of Digital Experiences in Mathematics Education and has written several books, including Mathematics and the Body: Material Entanglements in the Classroom. She directs the Tangible Mathematics Project, which has created multitouch applications TouchCounts and TouchTimes."

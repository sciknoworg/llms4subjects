            "abstract": "Blue biotechnology plays a major role in converting marine biomass into societal value, being a key pillar for many marine economy developmental frameworks and sustainability strategies, such as the Blue Growth Strategy, diverse Sea Basin Strategies (e.g., Atlantic Action Plan Priority 1 and 2 and COM (2017) 183), the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Limassol Declaration, or even the UN Sustainable Development 2030 Agenda. However, despite the recognized biotechnological potential of marine biomass, the work is dispersed between multiple areas of applied biotechnology, resulting in few concrete examples of product development.This book highlight the vast potential that marine resources hold, from viruses to seaweeds, and a myriad of applications from antimicrobials and cosmetics to feed and food that contributes to a market-driven and industrially orientated research, which will increase the efficiency of the marine biodiscovery pipeline and ultimately deliver realistic and measurable benefits to society, which is paramount for sustained blue growth and a successful market penetration of targeted biomolecules or enriched extracts for new product development, which are cornerstone issues for the present and the future of a marine biobased economy",

            "title": "Shipwrecked : Disaster and Transformation in Homer, Shakespeare, Defoe, and the Modern World",
            "abstract": "This book presents the first comparative study of notable literary shipwrecks from the past four thousand years, focusing on Homer\u2019s Odyssey, Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest, and Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe. James V. Morrison considers the historical context as well as the \u201ctriggers\u201d (such as the 1609 Bermuda shipwreck) that inspired some of these works, and modern responses such as novels (Golding\u2019s Lord of the Flies, Coetzee\u2019s Foe, and Gordon\u2019s First on Mars, a science fiction version of the Crusoe story), movies, television (Forbidden Planet, Cast Away, and Lost), and the poetry and plays of Caribbean poets Derek Walcott and Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire.For survivors who are stranded on an island for some period of time, shipwrecks often present the possibility of a change in political and social status\u2014as well as romance and even paradise. In each of the major shipwreck narratives examined, the poet or novelist links the castaways\u2019 arrival on a new shore with the possibility of a new sort of life",

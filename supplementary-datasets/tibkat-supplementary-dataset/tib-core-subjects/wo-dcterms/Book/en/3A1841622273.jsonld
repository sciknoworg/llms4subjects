            "abstract": "Explores the only known private book collection from medieval Jerusalem Translates, edits and discusses the most important Arabic medieval book list for Jerusalem \u2013 the largest known dataset on book pricesRethinks the notion of archival and documentary practices in the Mamluk period Provides a new angle on the economic history of the book in the late-medieval period Combines social history and material philology in the field of Middle Eastern historyIn the late medieval period manuscripts galore circulated in private collections and in educational libraries in the cities of the Middle East. Yet very few have left a documentary trail or have survived as an easily identifiable compact corpus. Writing their histories, understanding their social settings and comprehending their intellectual profiles is therefore a challenge.This book discusses the only known private book collection from pre-Ottoman Jerusalem for which we have a trail of documents. It belonged to an otherwise unknown resident, Burh\u0101n al-D\u012bn; after his death, his books were sold in a public auction and the list of objects sold has survived.This list \u2013 edited and translated in this volume \u2013 shows that a humble part-time reciter of the late 14th century had almost 300 books in his house, evidence that book ownership extended beyond the elite. Based on a corpus of almost fifty documents from the \u1e24aram al-shar\u012bf collection in Jerusalem, it is also possible to get a rare insight into the social world of such an individual. Finally, the book gives a unique insight into book prices as it will make available the largest such set of data for the pre-Ottoman period",

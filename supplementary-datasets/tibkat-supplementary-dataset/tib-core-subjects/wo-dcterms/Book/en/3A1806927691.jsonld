                "This book provides a research-based analysis of public sector reforms in Pakistan. It offers a broad overview of reforms at different levels of government \u2013 including federal, provincial and local \u2013 and examines decentralization and devolution reforms in various policy sectors. It also reflects on market-oriented reforms and the steps taken to involve the private sector to build a better-governed public sector, and explores new trends in the public sector in the areas of digitalisation and disaster management. Bringing together young researchers, academics, and practitioners, the book sets a new milestone in the movement towards context-specific reform studies in both academia and the professional practice of public administration, particularly in South Asia. Abiha Zahra is Research Fellow at the Public Governance Institute, KU Leuven, Belgium and Assistant Professor at the Department of Governance and Global Studies, Information Technology University, Lahore, Pakistan.

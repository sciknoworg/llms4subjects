The fundamentals of digital logic design as well as the use of the Verilog hardware description language are discussed. The book covers computer organization and architecture, modern design concepts, and computer security issues. Techniques for designing both small and large combinational and sequential circuits are thoroughly explained. This detailed reference addresses memory technologies, CPU design, including techniques to increase performance, microcomputer architecture, such as \"plug and play\" device interfaces, and memory hierarchy. A chapter on security engineering methodology as it applies to computer architecture concludes the book. Sample problems, design examples, and detailed diagrams are provided throughout this practical resource. Coverage includes:  Combinational circuits: small designs Combinational circuits: large designs Sequential circuits: core modules Sequential circuits: small designs Sequential circuits: large designs Memory Instruction set architecture Computer architecture: interconnection Memory system Computer architecture: security \"--",

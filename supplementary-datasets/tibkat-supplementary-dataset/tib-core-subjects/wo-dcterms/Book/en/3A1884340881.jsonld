                "This book is for students enrolled in undergraduate mechanical engineering, or similar, programs. The material presented is based on nearly thirty years of class-tested lecture notes for courses on the applications of geometric tolerancing for designers. The book\u2019s emphasis is on fit requirements for machine components, as fit assurance makes up the majority of challenging applications in tolerancing. For design engineers, knowing how to apply geometric tolerances has been a challenge even for engineers who have practiced geometric tolerancing for a long time. The syntax and meaning of geometric tolerancing statements can be learned easily and quickly, but knowing how to use them correctly is much more difficult. In the Design-for-Fit approach, the presentation starts with the geometric requirements for various kinds of fit and then presents the geometric tolerance statements necessary to achieve those fits. Introduces a unique step-by-step design-based approach to the subject of fit assurance; Introduces new vocabulary and methods for design-based fit assurance applications; Focuses on real examples and tolerance statements tailored to fit applications. .",

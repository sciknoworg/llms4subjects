                "What are the secrets of a successful entrepreneur? When did the origins of enterprise occur? This important title addresses such questions by uniting historical case studies of entrepreneurial behaviour from 1200-2000. Key features of this collection include a thematic and chronological comparison of relevant studies as well as coverage of a range of industries, including the software industry. The editors have also selected papers which allow for an examination of a range of entrepreneurial backgrounds and personalities, including female entrepreneurs. This topical research review will be of great use to both students and academics who will benefit from the ability to contrast case-studies of large-firms and their executives with small firm-start-ups and their founders",

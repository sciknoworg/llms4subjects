            "abstract": "\"This book provides students and academics with a comprehensive analysis of the theory and practice of branding. The challenge to explore new and effective ways of harnessing the power of communication to engage with company stakeholders in interactive, immediate and innovative ways is ever-present in the digital era. Digital marketing and social media create opportunities for managers to communicate their brand's identity to their consumers and stakeholders. Yet, limited empirical research exists to elucidate these issues, and less still that assists our understanding of branding issues at an international level. Recognising the complexity and plurality at the heart of the branding discipline, this text explores the relationship between brands, identity and stakeholders. Working through building, designing and maintaining a brand, the authors consider such aspects as strategic planning and campaign management, research and measurement, media relations, employee communication, leadership and change communication, and crisis branding. Critically, differing methods and approaches applied to branding and communication research design are assessed, including both qualitative and quantative methods. Proposing a mixture of theory and practice with international case studies, this book is an invaluable companion for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students, academics of marketing and strategic brand management, as well as managers and decision makers globally\"--",

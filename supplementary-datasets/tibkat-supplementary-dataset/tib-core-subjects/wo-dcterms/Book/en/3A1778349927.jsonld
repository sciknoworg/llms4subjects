                "\u201cProf. Liebich depicts not only the history of post-communist regimes in Central-East Europe, but also these states\u2019 internal agendas and transformative debates. This book lives that history through telling it once again, thus challenging accepted prejudices.\u201d \u2014 Adrian Liviu Ivan, Professor, Babes-Bolyai University, Romania \u201cEast Central Europe is again on the news. After the fall of the Berlin Wall the region was hailed as a liberal champion; now it is scorned as an illiberal one. This seemingly puzzling metamorphosis is explained in a thoughtful and entertaining way by a leading historian of the region. I highly recommend Liebich\u2019s book to all those interested in European politics and history.\u201d \u2014 Jan Zielonka, Professor of European Politics, University of Oxford (UK), and Professor of Politics and International Relations, University of Venice, C\u00e1 Foscari (Italy) Moving from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 to the present day, this book traces the trajectory of the six East Central European former satellites of the Soviet Union (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria) that have joined the European Union. It seeks in particular to explain these countries\u2019 disenchantment with the \u201creturn to Europe\u201d in spite of their significant advances. The book proceeds country by country and then devotes chapters to some contemporary issues, such as minorities, migration, and the relations of these \u201cnew\u201d members with the European Union as a whole. The book eschews theory and is intended for a general audience, including students at all levels in political science and history classes devoted to the EU and to contemporary Europe, and to an academic and practitioner audience interested in world affairs and the evolution of the European Union. The book strives to fill a persistent knowledge gap in the English-speaking world concerning East Central Europe, and to offer fresh insights about the region in the context of contemporary geopolitics. Andr\u00e9 Liebich is Honorary Professor of International History and Politics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Switzerland. .",

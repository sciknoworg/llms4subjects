                "This book focuses on the prospects of fresh market waste management in developing countries. It characterizes fresh market wastewater and solid wastes, and highlights the human health impact of corresponding waste management practices. With regard to treatment technologies, the book discusses the anaerobic digestion of fresh solid wastes; the application of natural coagulants for wastewater treatment; the remediation of xenobiotics in wastewater using nanotechnology; and biofilter aquaponic systems for nutrient removal. All of these technologies are recent innovations, offer several concrete advantages, and can be applied in developing countries as non-central treatment systems. In addition, the book covers electricity production from fresh solid wastes using microbial fuel cells, demonstrating the potential held by recycling fresh market wastewater and solid wastes"

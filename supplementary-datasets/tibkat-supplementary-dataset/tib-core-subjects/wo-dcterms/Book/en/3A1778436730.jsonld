            "abstract": "In recent years, various families of fractional-order integral and derivative operators, such as those named after Riemann-Liouville, Weyl, Hadamard, Grunwald-Letnikov, Riesz, Erdelyi-Kober, Liouville-Caputo, and so on, have been found to be remarkably important and fruitful, due mainly to their demonstrated applications in numerous seemingly diverse and widespread areas of the mathematical, physical, chemical, engineering, and statistical sciences. Many of these fractional-order operators provide interesting, potentially useful tools for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, as well as integral, differintegral, and integro-differential equations; fractional-calculus analogues and extensions of each of these equations; and various other problems involving special functions of mathematical physics and applied mathematics, as well as their extensions and generalizations in one or more variables. For this Special Issue, we invite and welcome review, expository, and original research articles dealing with the recent advances in the theory of fractional-order integral and derivative operators and their multidisciplinary applications",

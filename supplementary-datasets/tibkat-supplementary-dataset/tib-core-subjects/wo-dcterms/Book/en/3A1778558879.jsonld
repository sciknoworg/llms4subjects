            "title": "When (and How) Is Theory of Mind Useful? Evidence from Life-Span Research",
            "abstract": "Theory of Mind (ToM) or mentalization is the ability to understand and foresee the behavior referring to one\u2019s own and others\u2019 mental states (Premack & Woodruff, 1978; Wimmer & Perner, 1983). This capacity, which is considered the most representative mechanism of social cognition, is a multifaceted set of competences liable to influence \u2013 and be influenced by \u2013 a manifold of psychosocial aspects. Studies on typical and atypical/clinical development during life showed that ToM is frequently delayed (e.g. in deafness) or impaired in many clinical conditions (e.g. Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Schizophrenia, Borderline Personality Disorder, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease) and, on the other hand, may not be unequivocally a positive experience. It is therefore possible to consider the existence of multiple kinds of Theory of Mind. In fact, ToM may vary along a quantitative and a qualitative continuum. As for the quantitative dimension, the continuum is constituted by the fluctuation between high and low levels of ToM ability in different clinical conditions. Along this continuum, impairment can mean \u201cnot enough\u201d ToM (for example in Autism Spectrum Disorder) as well as \u201ctoo much\u201d ToM (for example in Schizophrenia and Borderline Personality Disorder). The qualitative dimension \u2013 highly interrelated with the quantitative one - regards the shift between adaptive (e.g. prosocial, nice ToM) vs. unadaptive (e.g. antisocial, nasty ToM) mental states content. The issue is discussed in light of recent evidence from outstanding researchers working on typical and atypical/clinical populations along the life-span. Findings from the fields of psychology, neuropsychology and neuroscience enrich the research topic argumentation",

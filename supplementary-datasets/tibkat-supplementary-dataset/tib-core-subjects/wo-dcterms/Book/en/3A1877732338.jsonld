            "abstract": "The book \"Thrombocytopenia\" certainly raises some important issues in its pathogenesis and management. The authors have done a lot of hard work to write state-of-the-art chapters. Each and every chapter is peer-reviewed, evidence-based, and remarkably excellent. Some of the causes of thrombocytopenia are well explained in textbooks, but the topics included in this book are not usually so well described. The chapters are written in such a manner so as to stimulate and keep the reader well-informed. Such an approach is certainly beneficial when aiming to motivate discussion, interaction, innovation, and research. Chapters like \"Interferon-Induced Thrombotic Microangiopathy\" have been included with the aim to help in understanding the immune pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia. Others have also been selected to keep an eye on the future",

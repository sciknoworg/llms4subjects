            "abstract": "Driven by new regulations, new market structures, and new energy resources, the smart grid has been the trigger for profound changes in the way that electricity is generated, distributed, managed, and consumed. The smart grid has raised the traditional power grid by using a two-way electricity and information flow to create an advanced, automated power supply network. However, these pioneering smart grid technologies must grow to adapt to the demands of the current digital society. In today\u2019s digital landscape, we can access feasible data and knowledge that were merely inconceivable. This Special Issue aims to address the landscape in which smart grids are progressing, due to the advent of pervasive technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). It will be the advanced exploitation of the massive amounts of data generated from (low-cost) IoT sensors that will become the main driver to evolve the concept of the smart grid, currently focused on infrastructure, towards the digital energy network paradigm, focused on service. Furthermore, collective intelligence will improve the processes of decision making and empower citizens. Original manuscripts focusing on state-of-the-art IoT networking and communications, M2M communications, cyberphysical system architectures, big data analytics or cloud computing applied to digital energy platforms, including design methodologies and practical implementation aspects, are welcome",

            "abstract": "From the reviews of the second edition: \".. The authors of this book have excelled by linking the title to two well-known mathematical packages, Maple and MATLAB. There are good reasons for this. Maple is supremely competent in symbolic mathematics and MATLAB in numerical and engineering calculations. MATLAB users can also gain access to Maple functions through an optional MATLAB symbolic mathematics toolbox, which is a version of Maple recast to suit MATLAB users. The authors have been involved with mathematical software for many years and are well qualified to serve as guides in this difficult field. They have chosen a particularly wide range of well-defined problems, such as the three body problem, radar and heat flow, to illustrate the methods involved. They explain the theory adequately and give examples of Maple and MATLAB code. .. Although some of the problems chosen may not be to everybody's taste, teachers of mathematical applications and modelling should have this book. Many people interested in mathematics as a hobby will aslo find it worthwile.\" Scientific Computing World \".. The presentation is unique, and extremely interesting. I was thrilled to read this text, and to learn the powerful problem-solving skills presented by these authors. I recommend the text highly, as a learning experience, not only to engineering students, but also to anyone interested in computation.\" Mathematics of Computation The third edition of this book has been enlarged by six new chapters; some of the previous chapters have been substantially revised. The index has been considerably enlarged: there are now three parts, two of them contain all the commands of Maple and Matlab that are used in this book. All chapters have been adapted to the newest versions of Maple (Version 5 Release 4) and Matlab 5",

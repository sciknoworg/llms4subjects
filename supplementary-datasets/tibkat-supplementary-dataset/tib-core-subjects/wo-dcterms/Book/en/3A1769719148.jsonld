                "This proceedings volume gathers together selected peer-reviewed papers presented at the second edition of the XXVI International Joint Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IJCIEOM), which was virtually held on February 22-24, 2021 with the main organization based at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Works cover a range of topics in industrial engineering, including operations and process management, global operations, managerial economics, data science and stochastic optimization, logistics and supply chain management, quality management, product development, strategy and organizational engineering, knowledge and information management, sustainability, and disaster management, to name a few. These topics broadly involve fields like operations, manufacturing, industrial and production engineering, and management. This book can be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in optimization research, operations research, and correlated fields.",

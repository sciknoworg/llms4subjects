            "abstract": "Like other cities on water, Tokyo and Venice are characterised by intrinsic fragility, resulting from the combined work of the continuous emergence of technological, economic, social, and environmental forces, which affect the urban structure and landscape. Their tangible and intangible (material and immaterial) heritage can play a fundamental role in both maintaining their peculiar maritime identity and defining a future vision for the city. Accordingly, this volume focuses on how the rediscovery of water, from both architectural and cultural points of view, as well as the preservation of the historical and local character of the use of water, can contribute to new forms of resilience. The contributions from scholars, experts, and practitioners in various disciplines - from the social sciences and humanities to architecture and urban planning - that are brought together in this volume help to clarify the basic importance of maintaining and preserving the distinctive identity of two paradigmatic cases of cities on water",

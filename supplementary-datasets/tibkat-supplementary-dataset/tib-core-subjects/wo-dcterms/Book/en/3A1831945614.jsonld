            "abstract": "\"Presenting the evolution of supplementary pensions over the past 25 years, this comprehensive book introduces the origin of pensions as a concept and explores the role that international organisations play within the field. It draws comparisons between different welfare states, reflecting upon current research and identifying new directions and ideas. Despite observing significant differences in the approaches to pension design, the book identifies common challenges, including the need to provide for an increasingly aging population, slow economic growth following the 2008 global financial crisis, the need for effective regulation, and increased labour market flexibility. Leading scholars analyse the experiences of a broad range of countries and offer insights into their responses to the numerous challenges faced by national pension systems. The book covers significant moments in pensions history following the World Bank's 1994 report on Averting the Old Age Crisis, and subsequent responses to challenges posed by longevity and economic crises. This book will be an ideal companion for academic researchers and financial law scholars interested in pensions and looking to develop an international perspective on the issue, as well as professionals in the pensions industry who are engaging with other countries and looking to develop their knowledge of overseas pension systems\"--",

            "abstract": "\"As the eponymous title The Science of Reading suggested, the aim of the first edition of this handbook was to bring together scientific studies of reading into a state-of-the-art review. The preface of that volume stated \"The science of reading is mature and healthy as the contributions to this volume make clear.\" Our aim in this second edition remained the same - to bring together scientific studies of reading into an updated overview of the field; as we shall see, old questions have been answered and new questions have arisen as understanding of the complexities of reading has deepened, driven by theoretical insights and methodological advances. Although advances in knowledge are expected in an active research field, the rise of The Science of Reading as a movement aiming to use empirical evidence from scientific studies of reading to inform education and teacher knowledge, and to translate from the laboratory to the classroom was unanticipated by the first edition of this handbook. The International Literacy Association defines the Science of Reading as \"a corpus of objective investigation and accumulation of reliable evidence about how humans learn to read and how reading should be taught.\" Not every reading scientist is working on developmental issues and even fewer focus on the translation of research findings to practice. We believe it is important that research continues at a basic and \"laboratory level.\" However, knowledge gained from basic science can and should be used to inform instructional approaches - and this is the difficult part. Reading practitioners have an important role to play in partnership with researchers by providing vital expertise about classrooms, cultures, and contexts, factors often downplayed in cognitive models. It is only when these are understood that it will be possible to implement evidence-based programs of literacy instruction that are sustainable in communities and cultures around the world.\"--",

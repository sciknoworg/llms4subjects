            "abstract": "\"Statistical methods for spatial data have advanced significantly during the last few decades. Traditional methods such as difference of means tests and regression require different approaches when used with geographic data - this is because dependence among observations that are close in space reduces the effective size of the sample. These advances have been put into practice and have been made accessible through a variety of software platforms. There are also a number of advanced texts that cover many of the methods in detail. There is, however, a gap between the coverage of software, applications, and interpretation on the one hand, and the advanced methodological treatments on the other. What is needed is a text, aimed primarily at students, that has the objective of introducing spatial statistical methods in a gentle manner. This text builds upon an introductory course in statistics, and contains expository examples and elementary exercises. It should therefore provide a solid footing for the interested reader to then both apply and interpret the methods, and read and understand the more advanced texts. The general idea is to have a two-volume set, with Statistical Methods for Geography (5th edition) serving as the first volume. In the revision of SMfG, the material on spatial regression and spatial patterns that appears at the end of the book has been cut, leaving it as a more traditional introductory statistics text. The importance of spatial methods will be indicated there, but the details and primary material have been moved to Spatial Statistical Methods for Geography. This is the first text to provide students (rather than researchers) with a basic introduction, and it's written by an author who is practised in writing accessible/pedagogically focussed texts in stats for SAGE\"--",

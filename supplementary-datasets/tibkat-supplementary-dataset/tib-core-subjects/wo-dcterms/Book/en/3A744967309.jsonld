            "abstract": "This publication documents the proceedings of the first Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) and Applications, hosted by the Institute for Computer Applications in Science and Engineering (ICASE) and the NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, 29-31 May, 1996, and attended by approximately 70 people from academia, government laboratories, and industry. ICASE's charter mission in 1972 remains today - to explore novel computer environments (vector in the 1970s; parallel in the 1990s) for scientific computing. These proceedings provide a necessary foundation for symposia in computational electromagnetics for future aerospace applications. The objectives of this CEM Workshop were to provide a forum for many of the leaders of the community to assess the state of CEM technology and to discuss areas of research for future programmatic planning activities. Workshop sessions included topics on optimization, industrial applications, algorithms, and a special panel session was provided during which issues were discussed and future research areas were identified. Hopefully, this publication will stimulate and improve communication among multidisciplinary researchers as well as highlighting several CEM areas that need improvement - especially for highly challenging problems. The two most important criteria in the selection of speakers for the workshop were their substantial contribution to large-scale CEM problems and their ability to articulate the issues confronting the CEM research community. Based on the results obtained, it is anticipated that this publication will be useful to government, industry, and university researchers to plan future research tasks in CEM analytical methods and applications",

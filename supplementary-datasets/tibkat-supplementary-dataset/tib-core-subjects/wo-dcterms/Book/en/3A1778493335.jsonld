            "title": "Mozart's Tempo-System : A Handbook for Practice and Theory",
            "abstract": "A reference book for the musician\u2019s practical work of interpretation, this volume, after a general presentation of 18th century principles for determining a tempo, offers a compendium of all Mozart\u2019s autograph tempo markings in 420 lists of pieces of similar character. Thus, a comparison of slower and quicker movements is made possible by 434 music examples, and there follows a wide-ranging collection of relevant texts taken from historical sources. The book does not claim to know \u201cthe single correct tempo\u201d for the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It hopes to be of assistance in the unavoidable search by every interpreter for the \u201ctrue mouvement\u201d of each work\u2014for the work itself, for the performer, the instrument or instruments, the room, the public, the nature of the event. It follows that there can be no absolutely \u201cauthentic\u201d tempo for Mozart\u2019s works. And yet his tempo markings, since he chose them so meticulously, should be taken equally seriously with the other parameters of his famously precise notation. Alfred Brendel writes: \u201can astonishing opus \u2026 one of those rare and important books in which music and musicology form a vital association; a lifelong study that makes one very much aware of a field to which attention is rarely paid. It accomplishes this by bringing to bear an understanding that never loses sight of the musical foundation on which it is built, and by a discerning intelligence that does not shy away from raising debatable topics, although without ever claiming infallibility \u2026 One cannot be grateful enough to Helmut Breidenstein for his methodological accuracy which allows us Mozart interpreters to orientate ourselves with ease and pleasure \u2026 His book sharpens our perception, at the same time giving an overview and making us sensitive to each individual case. Admiration and gratitude.\u201d",

            "abstract": "It is very well known that differential equations are related with the rise of physical science in the last several decades and they are used successfully for models of real-world problems in a variety of fields from several disciplines. Additionally, difference equations represent the discrete analogues of differential equations. These types of equations started to be used intensively during the last several years for their multiple applications, particularly in complex chaotic behavior. A certain class of differential and related difference equations is represented by their respective fractional forms, which have been utilized to better describe non-local phenomena appearing in all branches of science and engineering. The purpose of this book is to present some common results given by mathematicians together with physicists, engineers, as well as other scientists, for whom differential and difference equations are valuable research tools. The reported results can be used by researchers and academics working in both pure and applied differential equations",

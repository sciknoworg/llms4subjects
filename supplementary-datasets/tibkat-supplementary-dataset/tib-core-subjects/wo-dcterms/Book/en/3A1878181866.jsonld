                "This book covers crop stress management with potential implications for crop production induced by Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). It provides new insights into our understanding of the mechanisms of AMF-mediated growth regulation and stress tolerance covering the most recent biochemical, physiological, molecular, environmental and ecological studies. Focusing on various physiological and molecular mechanisms induced by AMF to enhance tolerance to different stresses, each environmental constraint is discussed in an individual dedicated chapter. Moreover, the book provides not only updated information with new insights and perspectives but also several new topics, such as comprehensive discussion on biotic stressors, the potential role of elevated CO2, hormones, and signal molecules in stress perception, signal transduction and subsequent stress tolerance. The book also discusses the potential implications of AMF for sustainable crop production in the context of climate change. The book can a useful reference book for academics and scientists involved in related research, such as cademics in agronomy and plant sciences, scientists involved in beneficial fungi research, chemists, industrialists and employees involved in the production and marketing of biofertilizers, master and doctoral degree students of agronomy, horticulture, and plant protection majoring in plant physiology and molecular biology, consultants working on the production of crops in marginal environments as well as phytotechnologists working for assisted phytoremediation program. It would also be suitable for agronomy, ecology and plant science-related courses, such as, plant stress physiology, plant growth-promoting microbes, and plant physiology and biochemistry to teach undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students at colleges and universities.",

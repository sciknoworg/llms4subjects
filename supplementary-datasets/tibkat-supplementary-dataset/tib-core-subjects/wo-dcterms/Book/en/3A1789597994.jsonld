                "Unsure of how or where to get started with Azure API Management, Microsoft\u2019s managed service for securing, maintaining, and monitoring APIs? Then this guide is for you. Azure API Management integrates services like Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), Function Apps, Logic Apps, and many others with the cloud and provides users with a single, unified, and well-structured fa\u00e7ade in the cloud. Mastering Azure API Management is designed to help API developers and cloud engineers learn all aspects of Azure API Management, including security and compliance. It provides a pathway for getting started and learning valuable management and administration skills. You will learn what tools you need to publish a unified API fa\u00e7ade towards backend services, independent of where and what they run on. You will begin with an overview of web APIs. You will learn about today\u2019s challenges and how a unified API management approach can help you address them. From there you\u2019ll dive into the key concepts of Azure API Management and be given a practical view and approach of API development in the context of Azure API Management. You'll then review different ways of integrating Azure API Management into your enterprise architecture. From there, you will learn how to optimally maintain and administer Azure API Management to secure your APIs, and learn from them, gaining valuable insights through logging and monitoring. What You Will Learn Discover the benefits of an enterprise API platform Understand the basic concepts of API management in the Microsoft cloud Develop and publish your APIs in the context of Azure API Management Onboard users through the developer portal Help your team or other developers to publish their APIs more efficiently Integrate Azure API Management securely into your enterprise architecture Manage and maintain to secure your APIs and gain insights This book is for API developers, cloud engineers, and Microsoft Azure enthusiasts who want to deep dive into managing an API-centric enterprise architecture with Azure API Management. To get the most out of the book, the reader should have a good understanding of micro services and APIs. Basic coding skills, including some experience with PowerShell and Azure, are also beneficial. Sven Malvik is an experienced Azure expert. He specializes in compliance and digital transformation, most recently in the financial industry. He has decades of experience in software development, DevOps, and cloud engineering. Sven is a Microsoft MVP in Azure and a speaker, presenting sessions and tutorials at a number of global conferences, user group meetings, and international companies.",

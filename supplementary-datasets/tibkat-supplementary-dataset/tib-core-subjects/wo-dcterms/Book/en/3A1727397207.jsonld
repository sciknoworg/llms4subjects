            "abstract": "\"By using mathematical models to describe the physical, biological or chemical phenomena, one of the most common results is either a differential equation or a system of differential equations, together with the correct boundary and initial conditions. The determination and interpretation of their solution are at the base of applied mathematics. Hence the analytical and numerical study of the differential equation is very much essential for all theoretical and experimental researchers, and this book helps to develop skills in this area. Recently non-linear differential equations were widely used to model many of the interesting and relevant phenomena found in many fields of science and technology on a mathematical basis. This problem is to inspire them in various fields such as economics, medical biology, plasma physics, particle physics, differential geometry, engineering, signal processing, electrochemistry and materials science. This book contains seven chapters and practical applications to the problems of the real world\"--",

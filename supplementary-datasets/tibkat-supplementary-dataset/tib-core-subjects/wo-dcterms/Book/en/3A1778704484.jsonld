            "abstract": "The term \"myositis\" covers a variety of disorders often designated \"idiopathic inflammatory myopathies\". Although they are rather rare compared to other rheumatic diseases, they often cause severe disability and not infrequently increased mortality. The additional involvement of important internal organs such as the heart and lungs, is not uncommon. Thus, there is a great need for a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of myositis, which may lead to improved treatment and care for these patients. Major advances regarding research and medical treatment have been made during recent years. Of particular importance is the discovery of the Myositis specific autoantibodies, linking immunological and pathological profiles to distinct clinical disease entities. A wide range of aspects of myopathies is covered in the book presented by highly qualified authors, all internationally known for their expertice on inflammatory muscle diseases. The book covers diagnostic, pathological, immunological and therapeutic aspects of myositis",

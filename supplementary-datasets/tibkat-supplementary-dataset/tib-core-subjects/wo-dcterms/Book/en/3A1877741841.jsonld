            "abstract": "Shifting the performance of an invasive procedure from operating room or interventional lab to the ICU has advantages for both the patient and the doctor performing the procedure. The book is a guide to interventions that are commonly performed in the intensive care unit, without the need of an operating room. In the following chapters, the authors show that procedures like endotracheal intubation, videolaryngoscopy, pericardial puncture, lumbar puncture and percutaneous cholecystostomy, and intra-abdominal pressure monitoring can be safely performed outside the operating room, at the bed of the patient. All the chapters of the book are clinically orientated providing explanations and illustrations for invasive procedures. Practical recommendations are given in the book, accompanied by figures for techniques performed in critically ill patients. It will serve the experienced doctor who has not performed a procedure for a long time as well as the young doctors needing a practical assistance when facing a new patient",

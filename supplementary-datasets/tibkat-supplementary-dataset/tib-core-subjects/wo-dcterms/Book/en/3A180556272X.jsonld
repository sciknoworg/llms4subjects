                "This book presents new research results in the field of gravity compensation in robotic systems. It explores topics such as gravity compensation of planar articulated robotic manipulators; the stiffness modeling of manipulators with gravity compensators; the multi-degree-of-freedom counter-balancing; the design of actuators with partial gravity compensation; a cable-driven robotic suit with gravity compensation for load carriage; various compensation systems for medical cobots and assistive devices; gravity balancing of parallel robots. The volume demonstrates that gravity compensation methods continue to develop, and new approaches and solutions are constantly being reported. These solutions apply both to new structural solutions and to their new applications. Cobots, exoskeletons and robotic suits, assistive devices, as well as biomechanical systems are among the most promising applications and most pressing areas for further innovation."

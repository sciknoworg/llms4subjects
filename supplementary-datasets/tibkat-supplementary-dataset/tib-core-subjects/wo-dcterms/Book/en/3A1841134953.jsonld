            "abstract": "Vestiges of Gallo-Roman workshops that were in activity between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD in the city of Augustodunum were found in the course of work carried out at the Lyc\u00e9e militaire in Autun. The workshop buildings are described in detail and situated in their urban setting. The different crafts activities are studied closely: metalworking with copper and iron alloys, ceramics, crafts of bone. This work has enhanced our knowledge of the chain of production in metallurgical crafts in particular. Fresh data on the manufacture of common objects such as brass fibulae and bells of bronze coated iron sheet is obtained from the analysis of mould fragments, of furnace remains and of forge slag and waste. Crafts emerge as a major feature of the economy in the city of the Aedui, according to processes already identified at Bibracte. The rich documentation of this work constitutes a significant contribution to research on crafts in ancient times",

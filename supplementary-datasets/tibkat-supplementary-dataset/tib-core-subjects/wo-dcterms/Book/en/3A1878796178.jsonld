            "abstract": "\"Advanced Controls for Wind Driven Doubly Fed Induction Generators discusses the most advanced control algorithms used for enhancing the dynamics of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) operating at fixed and variable speeds, and which used for different utilization purposes (standalone and grid connection). Extensive generator performance analysis has been introduced using various control topologies. Features Presents modeling of a wind energy conversion systems (WECS), including a wind turbine as a prime mover, a DFIG as a generation unit for electrical energy and a three-phase induction motor as an isolated load. Explores a detailed description for the presented control algorithms in order to visualize the base principle of each method. Introduces a comprehensive performance analysis for the DFIG using the formulated PVC scheme and other control techniques under different operating conditions. Examines the formulation of new control approaches which overcome the shortages present in previous DFIG control schemes. Presents a detailed comparison between different control topologies for the DFIG to outline the most effective procedure in terms of dynamic response, structure simplicity, ripples, THD and computational burdens. The book is written for researchers and academics working on advanced control systems, and those interested in areas such as machine drives, renewable energy systems, 'adaptive control', modeling of WECS, and optimization theory\"--",

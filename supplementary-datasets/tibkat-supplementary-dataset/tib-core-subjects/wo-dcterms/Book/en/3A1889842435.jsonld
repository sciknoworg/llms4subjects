                "Management, Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Challenging Global Times begins to address the need for a response to unprecedented global situations that require large-scale cooperation as well as individual organizational and institutional changes. Embodying the proceedings of the 16th International Symposium in Management, held in Timisoara, Romania in October 2021, this book gathers interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary studies, which highlight less-high-profile research concepts in management and industrial engineering. The contributions discuss details of state-of-the-art business-process-management techniques that integrate innovative methods with technologies that promote organizational agility. The methodologies used are sparking breakthroughs in entrepreneurship, financial management, supply-chain management and sustainability management. Other contributions deal with the important process of digitization, which underlies the Industry 4.0 idea and raises issues across the fields discussed in this volume. Related areas, such as management-information systems and business philosophies that adapt and use contemporary approaches to maximize organizational knowledge feature among the contributions. Similarly, reflecting the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in catalyzing economic growth, part of the book focuses on a set of tools and techniques designed for their benefit. This book assembles contributions from international sources that will help researchers and students interested in industrial and business management to tackle problems that persist from the economic crisis of the late 2000s right up to those that arise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic of the early 2020s."

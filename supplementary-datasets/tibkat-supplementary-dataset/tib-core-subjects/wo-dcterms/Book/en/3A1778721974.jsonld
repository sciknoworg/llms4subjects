            "title": "Dynamic Modelling",
            "abstract": "When talking about modelling it is natural to talk about simulation. Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or systems over time. The objective is to generate a history of the model and the observation of that history helps us understand how the real-world system works, not necessarily involving the real-world into this process. A system (or process) model takes the form of a set of assumptions concerning its operation. In a model mathematical and logical assumptions are considered, and entities and their relationship are delimited. The objective of a model \u2013 and its respective simulation \u2013 is to answer a vast number of \u201cwhat-if\u201d questions. Some questions answered in this book are: What if the power distribution system does not work as expected? What if the produced ships were not able to transport all the demanded containers through the Yangtze River in China? And, what if an installed wind farm does not produce the expected amount of energyt? Answering these questions without a dynamic simulation model could be extremely expensive or even impossible in some cases and this book aims to present possible solutions to these problems",

            "abstract": "\"Few people come into logistics management with knowledge and experience of all aspects of the profession. Some may have worked their way up from driving a vehicle but know little of warehouses, others may find themselves taking responsibility for logistics as part of a wider remit such as operations. A Practical Guide to Logistics aims to equip them with the necessary knowledge to move on to the next stage, with simple non-technical explanations of the options available, and impartial advice on how to choose the right option for their business. It is also an excellent primer for students studying logistics for the first time, on BSc or MSc courses, as well as practitioners on professional training courses. A Practical Guide to Logistics is a straightforward guide taking readers through all aspects of this fascinating industry, covering packaging, transportation, warehousing and exporting and importing of goods. There is a real need for this basic knowledge, both for practitioners starting out in the industry or more experienced practitioners who may have gaps in their knowledge. The book examines each aspect of logistics in turn and the text is supported by numerous illustrations\"--",

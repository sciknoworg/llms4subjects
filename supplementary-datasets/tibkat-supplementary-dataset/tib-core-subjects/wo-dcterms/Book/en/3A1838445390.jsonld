                "\u201cThis book offers a systematic examination of poverty, inequality, and innovation from a perspective of the Global South. It examines and foregrounds historical backgrounds, context, measurements, policies, programmes, approaches to services including continuous monitoring and evaluation processes. The book also reflects on proposing that public policies should be based on rigorously and scientifically established evidence.\u201d -- Mulugeta F. Dinbabo, Professor of Development Studies, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa \u201cA brilliant book on the nexus between poverty, inequality, innovation and development. The book opens new vistas and fresh pathways for Africa\u2019s development steeped in lived experiences from the Global South.\u201d --Saumya Chakrabarti, Ph.D. Professor of Economics, Visva-Bharati (University), Santiniketan, India. Oliver Mtapuri is Professor at the School of Built Environment and Development Studies, University of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. This edited volume analyzes the experiences learned in practice especially among small holder farmers to eradicate poverty. In other words, it discusses practical solutions which small scale farmers can use to alleviate poverty and reduce inequality. This addresses the issue of inclusive and sustainability of projects leading to the notion of not leaving anyone behind. The book provides insights that can be translated into policy with potential to inform practice. It also has the potential to address the issue of rural urban migration by providing knowledge that is usable by small scale farmers, policy makers and entrepreneurs alike. The volume is written by authors from different countries, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe, indicating the commonality of the problems of poverty and inequality. It contains insights from all these countries assembled together into an amalgam of practices ready to use and implement informed by evidence from the field as most of the chapters are based on empirical data."

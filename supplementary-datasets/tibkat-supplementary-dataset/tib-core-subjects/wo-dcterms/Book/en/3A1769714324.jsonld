It is a wonderful learning resource for environmentalists, policy tool for African government and a rich source of knowledge.\u201d -- Dr. Emmanuel Mutambara, Graduate School of Business & Leadership, Westivile Campus, Durban. University of Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa. \u201cThis book has conceptualized the dynamics as well as complexities of resources, human security and conflicts in the African continent. The rich data collected by the writers in presenting their facts are overwhelming. It is a fantastic learning and intellectual enriching resource for global scholar that are conscious of African studies.\u201d -- Prof. Romanus Ejiaga, Dean, Faculty of Humanities, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, Ikwo, Nigeria. This book shows the push and pull effects between resources, human security and conflicts in Africa. It recognizes the need for resources in Africa to be processed into finished goods in order to influence global market and redefine the pattern of trade relations with powerful countries of Asia, America and Europe in shaping the destiny and future of African countries. The achievement of this laudable objective is plagued by the security challenges which are directly or indirectly linked to resource-related conflicts rocking most of the resource endowed countries in the continent, thereby threatening global peace and security. To deal with this menace in the continent, it requires global co-operation and support of foreign governments, international organizations, international non-government organizations, governments of host countries and its citizens. The book presents the cases and experiences of countries that are endowed with resource, as well as have experienced different forms of human insecurity and have witnessed environmental conflicts in its analysis, which make the discourse interesting and quite educating.

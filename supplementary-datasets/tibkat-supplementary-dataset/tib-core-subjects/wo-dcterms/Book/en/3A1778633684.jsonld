            "abstract": "Originally published by eth co-director David Hadbawnik\u2019s habenicht press in 2012, Ballads uses the lyric form to explore the effects of global Capitalism from a sharp Marxist perspective. Recognizing the congruence between folk song circulation and the circulation of money, the \u201ccurrency\u201d of the ballad alongside supply-side economics, Owens hails Wordworth\u2019s Lyric Ballads experiment (undertaken at the dawn of England\u2019s Industrial Age) as one touchstone. But he also understands the built-in obsolescence of the form, its tendency to hearken back to imaginary origins. \u201c[E]veryone has an idea they know what a ballad is,\u201d Owens writes in his \u201cWorking Notes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s this degraded thing shot through with a sense of pastness, cultural infancy and a charming but sometimes dangerous rusticity that needs to be carefully framed and reined.\u201d Thus Owens\u2019 Ballads playfully engages with language, figures, and forms from medieval and early modern England, with nods to the caesura-based, alliterative line, and Barbara Allan, Thomas the Rhymer, and Piers Plowman making appearances in the book\u2019s brief lyrics",

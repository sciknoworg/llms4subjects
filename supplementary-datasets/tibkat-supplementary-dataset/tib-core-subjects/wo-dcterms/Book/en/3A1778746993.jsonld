            "abstract": "Theodor Heuss was an extraordinarily versatile citizen and committed democrat who defended the Weimar Republic through all its crises. From 1918 onwards he worked as an editor and official in the Guild of German Writers. In addition, he was committed to education in citizenship and worked indefatigably as a writer and public speaker. It was above all as a left-wing liberal member of the German Parliament from 1924 onwards that Heuss fought for the beleaguered democracy until the end of the Weimar Republic.These 229 selected letters by Theodor Heuss - most of them published for the first time - reflect the interactions between his exciting biography and the dramatic times and events from the last year of the First World War to the investment with power of the National Socialists in January 1933. 229 letters, most of them published in this edition for the first time correspondence with the political, intellectual and artistic elite of the Weimar Republic part from their significance as an historical source, the letters display a high literary quality",

            "abstract": "Made in France examines the long history of the branding of the French nation, from the political imprint of Prime Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert to the present day. The politics of Made in France were articulated at several levels of power, which was  centralised by the French state, but also exercised locally, as in Paris and in the wine producing regions.  The French government has consistently fostered production that advertised its country-of-origin as a symbol of  quality on domestic and international markets. This chapter discusses the luxury industries, especially haute couture.  The experiences of this industry, and other luxury industries show that is possible to relocate production outside France, which has resulted in the  massification of luxury-item production",

            "abstract": "Sounding the Indian Ocean is the first volume to integrate the fields of ethnomusicology and Indian Ocean studies. Drawing on historical and ethnographic approaches, the book explores what music reveals about mobility, diaspora, colonialism, religious networks, media, and performance. Collectively, the chapters examine different ways the Indian Ocean might be \u201cheard\u201d outside of a reliance on colonial archives and elite textual traditions, integrating methods from music and sound studies into the history and anthropology of the region. Challenging the area studies paradigm\u2014which has long cast Africa, the Middle East, and Asia as separate musical cultures\u2014the book shows how music both forms and crosses boundaries in the Indian Ocean world. \u201cEvocative, wide-ranging, and fascinating. A highly original contribution that charts the way for many future paths of exploration.\u201d \u2014 RONIT RICCI, author of Islam Translated: Literature, Conversion, and the Arabic Cosmopolis of South and Southeast Asia \u201cUndoubtedly the definitive, standard-bearing work on the deeply cosmopolitan and interconnected soundworlds of the Indian Ocean.\u201d DAVESH SONEJI, author of Unfinished Gestures: Devadasis, Memory, and Modernity in South India \u201cA finely crafted voyage that secures the place of ethnomusicological scholarship in the reconstruction of one of the world\u2019s oldest long-distance trading arenas.\u201d \u2014 ANGELA IMPEY, author of Song Walking: Women, Music, and Environmental Justice in an African Borderland \u201cAdeptly shows how music composes and transgresses categories, genealogies, and geographies in Afro-Asiatic seascapes.\u201d \u2014 SMRITI SRINIVAS, coeditor of Reimagining Indian Ocean Worlds",

The book is was originally self-described on its cover flap as follows: \"The name of Offenbach, king of op\u00e9ra bouffe, author of La Vie Parisienne and The Tales of Hoffman is synonymous with the gaiety and wit of the French Second Empire. Visiting America in 1876, Offenbach ... was endlessly inquisitive about all he saw, from art and music to the New York Fire Department, from horse-cars to women's dress, from Niagara Falls to advertising. Offenbach found America and the Americans a source of unfailing entertainment, and the candid impressions which he recorded in his journal are fresh, droll, and full of charm.\"",

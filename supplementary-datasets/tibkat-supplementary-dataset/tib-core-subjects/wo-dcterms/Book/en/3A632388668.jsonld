            "abstract": "Steve Ringwood was given his first astronomy book (The Golden Book of Astronomy) when he was nine, and, like many others of his generation, the Apollo years cemented his lifelong fascination with space. At 15 he bought his first telescope, a Japanese 40mm refractor. That first incredible view of a first quarter Moon had him hooked, and thus began the series of instrument acquisitions of steadily growing apertures that continues to this day. As a teen he joined the British Astronomical Association (BAA) and shortly afterwards joined his local astronomy group (Loughton Astronomical Society), which, at the time, was building its own observatory to house a 16\" Cassegrain reflector. He later served many years on its committee - several of them as its chairman. During his forty years of astronomical activity Steve has encountered at first, second, and third hand many of the joys, pitfalls, and anxieties that astronomers of all shades face. His interest in astronomy and spaceflight has taken him all over the world - from the winter bleakness of northern Russia to the heat of northwestern Africa and the tropical wonders of Hawaii. Telescopically, his preferred targets are the Solar System planets, the Sun, and the Moon. He also has a keen interest in the history of astronomy. In addition to at one time editing his local group`s monthly journal, he has written for both U. S. and UK astronomy magazines. Together with occasional features and reviews, he currently produces a monthly product column for Astronomy Now. There have also been occasional `blink and you`ll miss it` interactions with TV and radio. Despite a long career in IT, his passion is astronomy and palaeontology (fossil collecting). Elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1984, he has written papers for the journals of both the BAA and the Royal Astronomical Society. With his wife and young son, he lives in a house chosen partly for its distance from sodium glow at night - a remoteness sadly decreasing with the passing years.",

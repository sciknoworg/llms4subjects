For several decades now, the conservation of contemporary art has been a dynamic field of research and reflection. Because of contemporary art\u2019s variable constitution, its care and management calls for a fundamental rethinking of the overall research landscape of museums, heritage institutions, private-sector organizations and universities. At first, this research was primarily pursued by conservation professionals working in or with museums and other heritage organizations, but increasingly academic researchers and universities became involved, for instance through collaborative projects. This book is the result of such collaboration. It sets out to bridge the \u201cgap\u201d between theory and practice by investigating conservation practices as a form of reflection and reflection as a form of practice",

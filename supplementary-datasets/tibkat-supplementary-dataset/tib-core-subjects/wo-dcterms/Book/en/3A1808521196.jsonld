            "title": "Shallow geothermal energy : theory and application",
            "abstract": "This book is the outcome of more than a decade of research and technical development activities at Spain\u2019s Geological Survey (IGME) concerning shallow geothermal energy, which were pursued in collaboration with other public bodies and European entities. It presents a compilation of papers on the theoretical foundations of, and practical aspects needed to understand the thermal regime of the topmost subsoil, up to 400 m deep, and the exceptional properties that this underground environment offers, which make it the ideal thermal reservoir for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). In the book\u2019s first section, the basic theory of thermodynamics as applied to shallow geothermal energy, heat transfer and fluid mechanics in the geological porous medium is developed. The nature of the subsoil\u2019s thermal regime in general and in the urban environment in particular is described. The second section introduces readers to the fundamental aspects of thermal installations equipped with geothermal heat pumps, describes the types of geothermal exchangers most commonly used, and reviews the techniques used to obtain the thermal parameters of the terrain. It also discusses the potential environmental impacts of shallow geothermal activity and corresponding management strategies, as well as the legal aspects of its regulation for the governance of shallow geothermal resources in the EU in general and Spain in particular. In closing, the book highlights examples of the methodologies\u2019 applications, developed by IGME in the city of Zaragoza and the Canary Islands. The theoretical foundations, systematics and concrete applications make the book a valuable reference source for hydrogeologists, engineers and specialized technicians alike.",

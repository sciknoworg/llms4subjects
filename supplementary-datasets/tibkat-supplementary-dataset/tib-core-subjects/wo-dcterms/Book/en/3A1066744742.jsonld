            "abstract": "\u201cIn Confucianism: Its Roots and Global Significance, English language readers get a rare opportunity to read the work in a single volume of one of Taiwan\u2019s most distinguished scholars. Although Lee Ming-huei has published in English before, the corpus of his non-Chinese writings is in German. Readers of this volume will discover the hard-mindedness and precision of thinking associated with German philosophy as they enter into Lee\u2019s discussions of Confucianism. Progressing through the book, they will be constantly reminded that all philosophy should be truly comparative. . . . \u201cThe work is divided into three parts: Classical Confucianism and Its Modern Re-Interpretations, Neo-Confucianism in China and Korea, and Ethics and Politics. These sections reveal the full range of Lee Ming-huei\u2019s thinking, including his view of Confucian philosophy\u2019s reach to encompass the whole of East Asia, Korea in particular. In the Ethics and Politics section, readers get a taste of Lee\u2019s return to his own tradition through the lens of Kantian philosophy with his analysis of Confucius and Virtue Ethics. His thinking through Mou Zongsan\u2019s interpretation of Confucianism, Zhu Xi, and the Huxiang scholars\u2019 debate on ren and the unfolding of discussions over the \u2018four buddings\u2019 and \u2018seven feelings\u2019 in Korea by Yi Toegye and Gi Gobong set up the subsequent chapters of the book: a reconstruction of Wang Yangming\u2019s philosophy and theories of democracy and a critique of Jiang Qing\u2019s \u2018Political Confucianism.\u2019 To be sure, the interrelated ideas and arguments presented here contribute significantly to the Confucian project in English-speaking countries across the world.\u201d \u2014from the Editor\u2019s Foreword",

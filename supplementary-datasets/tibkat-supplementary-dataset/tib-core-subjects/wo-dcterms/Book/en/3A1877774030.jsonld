                "In the realm of regional industrial development, academic scholars often find themselves grappling with a complex dilemma; how to effectively navigate the complex landscape of cross-sectoral inter-organizational collaborations to catalyze the emergence of vibrant regional industries? Traditional management approaches, characterized by hierarchical structures, frequently fall short when confronted with the intricacies of these collaborations, which involve a multitude of autonomous and diversified entities. The need for a fresh perspective in this dynamic field has never been more evident. Promoting Regional Industries Through Cross-Sectoral Collaborations: Regional System, Management, and the Management Body is a transformative book offering an innovative and comprehensive solution to the challenges posed by regional industrial development. Its core mission is to provide a robust theoretical framework that addresses the critical question of how to manage and facilitate cross-sectoral collaborations effectively. The authors recognize that traditional hierarchical approaches are ill-suited to the task, and thus, they offer a groundbreaking alternative. The book guides scholars and practitioners on a journey that begins with the creation of a management approach designed to construct and operate a regional system conducive to self-organizing cross-sectoral collaborations. Drawing from rich literature and real-world case studies, it outlines a conceptual model that revolutionizes the approach to building and operating regional systems, ultimately redefining the management landscape. It delves into change management theory, offering practical insights and a comprehensive model to guide the management of self-organizing processes towards collaboration. Lastly, it explores the critical role of a management body in facilitating these collaborations and presents a practical roadmap for building and re-building this essential entity. For academic scholars seeking to revolutionize regional industrial development, this book provides the indispensable guidance needed to navigate the complex web of cross-sectoral collaborations effectively. It offers fresh perspectives, practical insights, and a roadmap to reshape the future of regional industries through innovation and collaboration",
                "\"This book comprises case studies that show practical approaches to the goal of the topic above. Therefore, in conjunction with the practical implications withdrawn from the study, professionals/officials of the public sector, research institutions, and think tanks, who are involved in the survey and the program to promote regional industries and facilitate the collaborations, can benefit from this book to find the effective way to increase their performance\"--"

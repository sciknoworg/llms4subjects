            "abstract": "Japanese \"new religions\"shinsh\u016bky\u014d have used various media forms for training, communicating  with  members, presenting  their  messages, reinforcing or protecting  the image of the leader and potentially attracting converts. In this book, the complex and dual  relationship between the media and new religions  is  investigated  by  looking  at  the  tensions   groups  face  between  the need  for  visibility  and  the  risks  of  facing  attacks  and   criticism  through  the media.  Indeed,  media  and  new  technologies  have  been  extensively   used  by religious groups not only to spread their messages and to try to reach a wider audience,  but also to promote themselves as a highly modern and up-to-date form of religion appropriate for a  modern technological age. In the 1980s and early 1990s, some movements, such as Agonsh\u016b, K\u014dfuku no  Kagaku and Aum Shinriky\u014d, came into prominence especially via the use of media (initially pub-  lications, but also ritual broadcasts, advertising campaigns and public media events). This created  new modes of ritual engagement and new ways of inter- actions between leaders and members. The aim  of this book is to develop and illustrate particular key issues in the wider new religions and  media nexus by using specific movements as examples. In particular, the analysis of the inter-  action  between  media  and  new  religions  will  focus  primarily  on  three  case studies  predominantly during the first period of development of the groups",

            "abstract": "Universities and corporate partnerships play a crucial role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), presenting significant market opportunities across various research domains. On the occasion of the World Day for Safety and Health at Work in 2021, the International Labor Organization (ILO) urged nations to establish resilient occupational safety and health (OSH) systems to address future health crises effectively. This necessitates investments in OSH infrastructure and its seamless integration into comprehensive national emergency preparedness and response plans to safeguard workers' well-being and support business continuity. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) emphasizes that work environments are continually evolving. Particularly during economic challenges, it is essential to recognize that inadequate occupational safety and health measures can incur financial costs. Numerous case studies also demonstrate a direct link between effective OSH management within organizations and improved overall performance and profitability. This reprint compiles contributions from authors worldwide, covering a wide range of topics related to Advances in Occupational Health and Safety Management and Risk Management, with a focus on their application in specific domains",

            "title": "Remote Sensed Data and Processing Methodologies for 3D Virtual Reconstruction and Visualization of Complex Architectures",
            "abstract": "In recent years, the topic of 3D reconstruction and modeling of complex architectures from remotely acquired multiple data sources has been of growing interest. This \u201cdemocratization\u201d of 3D modeling processes and the large availability of data is, however, not always followed by reliable, affordable and powerful tools for realizing photo-realistic, metric, re-usable and semantic-aware 3D products. This should be a motivation to research, design, develop and validate novel easy-to-use, ease-to-learn and a low-cost framework for 3D modeling and further understanding of virtual environments using multiple data sources, so that the whole 3D modeling community has access to an affordable, transferable, functional and usable framework of methods and tools. This challenge causes several problems that should be addressed: from improving and testing the technical capabilities of new capturing devices, to the solution of problems resultant from large image blocks, from delivering Building Information Modeling (BIM) standards in order to provide new management approaches to replacing existing visualization tools with new working experiences such as Virtual and Augmented Reality or game-engine technology",

            "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Things, images have played important roles in human\u2013computer interactions, and with the arrival of big data technology, people have higher requirements regarding image quality, especially for images collected in dark light. This can be addressed through the development of camera hardware quality, i.e., the resolution and exposure time of cameras, which may require high computational costs. As an alternative, image enhancement techniques can exact salient features to improve the quality of captured images according to the differences in diverse features, although they suffer from some challenges, i.e., a low contrast, artifacts, and overexposure, thus making it decidedly necessary to determine how to use advanced image enhancement techniques. The topic of advances in the image enhancement of electronics is presented in this reprint, which brings together the research accomplishments of researchers from academia and industry. The secondary goal of this reprint is to display the latest research results of advances in image enhancement",

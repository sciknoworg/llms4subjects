            "title": "Avoiding Tokenism in Demand for Good Governance Activities : Lessons from World Bank-financed Lending Projects in Zambia",
            "abstract": "This paper is based on an evaluation of the Zambian lending portfolio carried out in early 2011. The paper begins by explaining the demand for good governance (DFGG) concept, identifying its increasing prevalence as a theme in World Bank discourse, locating it in a broader development agenda, and drawing out its implications for World Bank projects. The paper then presents the Zambian lending projects as a case study, drawing out the factors that contribute to DFGG success and failure on the ground. The relevance of this Zambian case study is that it demonstrates some of the particular challenges of trying to move DFGG commitments from paper to practice. Nine projects are considered in total. Each project is assessed for DFGG mechanisms in the following four categories: transparency and information, participation and consultation, monitoring and oversight, and capacity enhancement. The established mechanisms are considered according to a set of following four criteria s: effectiveness, efficiency, inclusiveness, and sustainability. This paper presents a background and explanation of the DFGG concept, describing its increasing prevalence as a theme in World Bank discourse, its location in a broader development agenda as well as its implications for World Bank projects. It further illustrates the Zambian lending projects as case studies, drawing out the factors that contribute to DFGG successes and failure on the ground. The paper concludes with specific recommendations on how interventions can be more experimental in their philosophy, more analytical in their preparation, and more managerial in their attempts to address internal obstacles",

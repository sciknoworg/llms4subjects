            "abstract": "Victorian literature is rife with scenes of madness, with mental disorder functioning as everything from a simple plot device to a commentary on the foundations of Victorian society. But while madness in Victorian fiction has been much studied, most scholarship has focused on the portrayal of madness in women; male mental disorder in the period has suffered comparative neglect. In \u2018The Most Dreadful Visitation\u2019, Valerie Pedlar redresses the balance. This extraordinary study explores a wide range of Victorian writings to consider the relationship between the portrayal of mental illness in literary works and the portrayal of similar disorders in the writings of doctors and psychologists. Pedlar presents in-depth studies of Dickens\u2019s Barnaby Rudge, Tennyson\u2019s Maud, Wilkie Collins\u2019s Basil and Trollope\u2019s He Knew He Was Right, considering each work in the context of Victorian understandings \u2013 and fears \u2013 of mental degeneracy",

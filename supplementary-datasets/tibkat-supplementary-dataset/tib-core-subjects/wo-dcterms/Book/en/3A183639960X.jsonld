            "abstract": "Thomas Straubhaar and Ingrid Hohenleitner outline the model of an unconditionally granted basic income. According to the authors, it can also be financed by Germany. They see the basic income as an opportunity to sustainably restructure the state budget and make the welfare state financially viable again for future generations. They show that new jobs of up to 1.17 million full-time jobs could be created, particularly in the low-wage sector. Michael Opielka sees the Althaus model as \"a kind of combination wage for all\". Part of the national income would be distributed to all. With a \"mixture of pragmatism and idealism\", the Solidarity Citizen's Income creates on the one hand a \"real\" labour market, but at the same time makes part-time work worthwhile and provides secure voluntary commitment and educational phases. With the Solidarity Citizen Income, wage differentiation in the lower income bracket no longer leads to poverty. The Solidarity Citizen Income of Dieter Althaus would be an important step on the way to more social solidarity, more subsidiarity and more (social) justice. Michael Schramm comes to this conclusion. In addition, the system of social security would be placed on an economically viable footing and the labour market and entrepreneurial forces would be stimulated",

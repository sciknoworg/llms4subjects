            "abstract": "\"The term \u201cinterest\u201d lacks a precise antonym. In English, we have \u201cdisinterested\u201d and \u201cuninteresting,\u201d but we want for a term that denotes robust opposition to interest. The same appears to hold true in every other language (as far as we know). Interest\u2019s missing antonym reflects not merely a widespread lexical oversight, but a misrecognition of interest\u2019s complete and exact meaning. More importantly, the idea that interest has no opposite expresses a certain refusal to acknowledge the power of the impulse to extinguish interest, for the self and for others.  Why then do we foreclose interest\u2019s possibility, degrade our (and others\u2019) capacities to experience interest, and destroy interest\u2019s objects? Why do we decline what interest proffers \u2014 which includes creative and subjective being, thinking, and relating \u2014 in favor of more primitive modes of survival, thoughtlessness, and nonbeing? Why do relationships \u2014 with ourselves, with others, with objects \u2014 toward which genuine interest draws us seem sometimes, if not often, unbearable?  These questions are difficult. Their answers, even more so. Misinterest: Essays, Pens\u00e9es, and Dreams attempts to approach them in an honest way, without making them fascinating, mysterious, boring, obscurantist, or fascinatingly mysteriously boringly obscurantist. Outwardly, Misinterest is concerned with dreams and forgetting and Eros and soaring dogs and groups and suicidal suburban teenagers and sex and jury duty and Nazis and fathers and hatred and holy parrots and fundamentalists and plagues and other things that may or may not be interesting. Ultimately, however, it seeks, like Jules Renard, \u201cen restant exact\u201d (in remaining true/real), to shed light on the establishment of misinterest, missingness, and mystery where and when they need not be, and, thus, on the psychic, familial, and political forces that compel us not to be when and where we ought.\"",

            "abstract": "This report is an annual review of the development effectiveness of the World Bank Group. The report assesses the World Bank Group's performance by analyzing the achievement of project and program objectives through validated ratings and by classifying these objectives according to their outcome levels. To provide new perspectives on performance, RAP 2020 also analyzes outcomes and discusses ways in which the Bank Group can continue to enhance its outcome orientation. The report highlights that the Bank Group's results measurement systems collect evidence needed for ratings and for process and compliance monitoring with limited evidence on the Bank Group's contributions to higher-level outcomes. Performance trends are positive for almost all Regions and Global Practices in the World Bank. Project ratings in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence show improvement but continue to lag those in other countries. Positive ratings trends can be linked to continued improvements in quality at entry, strong implementation support and M and E, and broadly conducive economic and institutional conditions in many larger countries before the pandemic. Ratings for MIGA projects continued to increase. IFC project ratings remain depressed overall, but with signs of a modest uptick in the most recent data. Less successful results are often linked to large shocks, internal work quality and issues with preparing for risks and their response when shocks occurred",

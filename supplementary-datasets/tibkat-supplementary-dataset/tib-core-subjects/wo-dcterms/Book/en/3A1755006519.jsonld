                "This book is intended to help management and other interested parties such as engineers, to understand the state of the art when it comes to the intersection between AI and Industry 4.0 and get them to realise the huge possibilities which can be unleashed by the intersection of these two fields. We have heard a lot about Industry 4.0, but most of the time, it focuses mainly on automation. In this book, the authors are going a step further by exploring advanced applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, ranging from the use of deep learning algorithms in order to make predictions, up to an implementation of a full-blown Digital Triplet system. The scope of the book is to showcase what is currently brewing in the labs with the hope of migrating these technologies towards the factory floors. Chairpersons and CEOs must read these papers if they want to stay at the forefront of the game, ahead of their competition, while also saving huge sums of money in the process."

                "'This is a timely contribution that responds to the concerns of a renowned political scientist, Joseph Nye, who expressed deep concern about the widening gap between academic theory and foreign policy practice.' \u2013Professor Eghosa Osaghae, Director-General, Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) \u2018The book is a welcome addition and deserves a distinct place among the many academic works on Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy. The rich insights by authors carefully selected to contribute to this book will be useful for both academics and policy makers with deep interest in the area of Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy architecture. \u2013Otunba Olusegun Akinsanya, mni, Former Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to Ethiopia \u2018A timely work of scholarship devoid of propaganda offering a rich mix of optimism and criticism of Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy in the past 60 years.\u2019 \u2013Ambassador Zango Abdu, mni, Retired Diplomat This book covers critical issues in Nigeria\u2019s external relations since 1960. As an independent nation, Nigeria has stood out as the most populous black country in the world and contributed immensely to the search for solutions to pressing international issues, notably in Africa affairs. Nigeria has also participated actively in global affairs and used the platform of international organisation to advance her national interests, cognisant also of its regional and global obligations and responsibilities. Contributors to this thought-provoking book make a strong case for Nigeria to press for a foreign policy that puts Nigerian people at the centre. One of the strong points also emanating from the contributors of this book is the imperative for Nigeria to address domestic challenges that continue to impinge on the country\u2019s external image. Usman A. Tar is Endowed Professor of Defence and Security Studies, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the Nigerian Defence Academy. Sharkdam Wapmuk is Associate Professor at the Department of Defence and Security Studies, Nigerian Defence Academy."

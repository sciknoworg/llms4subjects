Chapter 3 -The Quality of Large and Small Nation Territory Governments -- Chapter 4 -- Good Governance\u2019 and Entrenched Self-Government in Scotland: A Success? -- Chapter 5 -The Capacity of Self-Government in Greenland -- Chapter 6 -- Faroese Self-Government: A Disputed but Evolved Model -- Chapter 7 -- The quality of Self-government in the \u00c5land Islands -- Chapter 8 -- Is it better for nation territories to stand on one or two feet?",
                "This book assesses the quality of self-government in four northern European regions with strong autonomy rights. Examining the experiences of Scotland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and the \u00c5land Islands, it considers how these regions have developed their own political and administrative systems within the larger states they form part of. The book looks to understand the key democratic and administrative qualities of a functioning self-government, and how geographic size and economic and human resources can impact the ways in which partially independent territories govern. It also assesses the emotional dimensions of regional nationalism, and how this impacts the concept and public perception of partially independent nation territories. By focusing on the quality of self-government within these nation territories, the book considers whether strong autonomy contributes to peaceful co-existence within established national borders, or provides new munition for secessionist movements. It will appeal to students and scholars of sub-national governance, European politics, territorial politics and conflict management.

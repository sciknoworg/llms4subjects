            "abstract": "Effectively managing the reconciliation of CO-PA to the general ledger is a challenge that many companies struggle with. In this book, you will learn how to effectively solve reconciliation issues between CO-PA and FI in SAP ERP so that you can have confidence in the information derived from CO-PA reports. Learn the difference between costing-based and accounting-based CO-PA and walk through the various data flows into CO-PA. Identify reconciliation issues related to SD, MM and CO postings. The book is illustrated with numerous SAP screenshots and provides detailed examples of how to match the cost-of-sales account with corresponding value fields in CO-PA. Get tips on how to repost a document in CO-PA only. Walk through real-time and integrated scenarios to resolve reconciliation issues and ensure accuracy and timeliness. The author Paul Ovigele has worked as an ERP financials consultant since 1997 in both North America and Europe, specializing in implementing the Financial Accounting and Controlling modules and all integration areas for companies in various industries. He has spent countless hours investigating the issues that led to an imbalance between CO-PA and the general ledger and strategizing airtight processes to reconcile the two modules and set up procedures to make sure that any gaps are easily identified. Paul delivers training sessions to finance professionals at both functional and managerial levels, and is published in Financials Expert where he also serves as a technical adviser. He has presented at SAP financial and controlling conferences in both Europe and the United States.",

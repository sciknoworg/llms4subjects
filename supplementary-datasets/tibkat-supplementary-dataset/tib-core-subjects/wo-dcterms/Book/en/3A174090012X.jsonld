            "abstract": "This work, like others in the series (Defects and Diffusion inSemiconductors and Defects and Diffusion in Ceramics), continues a 30-year program which has the aim of succinctly summarizing progress in the fields of diffusion and defect research. The book is divided into three parts: the first part consists of original papers on various aspects of the topic at hand, including: interstitial hydrogen in bcc binary alloys, grain-boundary segregation acceleration by irradiation, diffusion of point defect/solute complexes, thermal defects in metallic glasses, radiation-enhanced self-diffusion, and the characteristics of point defects in actinides. The second part consists of a compilation of data which were published between approximately 1992 and 1997. The coverage here concentrates heavily on dependable experimental measurements of diffusion. The third part comprises abstracts of papers which were published during the past year, and concentrates on presenting the most accessible work, and especially those papers which furnished original data or reported important new techniques, phenomena or anomalies; although there is also extensive coverage of more qualitative features of diffusion and defect phenomena, of the predictions of computer models, and of theoretical studies.Altogether, this combination makes the present book the most up-to-date and convenient source of information on current trends in the field of Defects and Diffusion in Metals. And watch out for other books in this series",

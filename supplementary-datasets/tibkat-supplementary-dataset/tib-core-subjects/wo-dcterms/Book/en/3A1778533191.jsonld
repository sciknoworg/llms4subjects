            "title": "Fuzzy Techniques for Decision Making",
            "abstract": "This book contains the successful invited submissions to a Special Issue of Symmetry in the subject area of \u201cFuzzy Techniques for Decision Making\u201d. We invited contributions addressing novel techniques and tools for decision making (e.g., group or multi-criteria decision making) with notions that overcome the problem of finding the membership degree of each element as in Zadeh's original model. We could garner interesting articles on a variety of setups as well as applications. As a result, this book includes some novel techniques and tools for decision making, such as instrumental tools for analysis (correlation coefficients, similarity measures, aggregation operators) in various settings and novel methodological contributions (discrete optimization with fuzzy constraints, COMET, or fuzzy bi-matrix games) and applications (to project delivery systems, maintenance performance in industry, group emergencies, pedestrians flows, valuation of assets, water pollution control, or aquaculture enterprise sustainability). The published submissions cover models like fuzzy soft sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, (fuzzy) soft rough sets, neutrosophic sets, as well as other hybrid models",

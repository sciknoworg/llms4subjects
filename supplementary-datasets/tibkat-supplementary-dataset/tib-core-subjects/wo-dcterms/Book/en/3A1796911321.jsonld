In this book, prominent women engineers discuss many of the eighteen infrastructure categories from the 2021 ASCE Infrastructure Report Card providing background, analysis of the issues facing the category and projections for the future. Categories covered include aviation, bridges, dams, water and wastewater, energy, hazardous waste, inland waterways, levees, ports, public parks, rail, roads, solid waste, and transit. Case studies from the authors\u2019 work are included throughout. These topics touch on many of the challenges facing the world today and these solutions by women researchers and practitioners are valuable for their technical excellence and their non-traditional perspective. As an important part of the Women in Engineering and Science book series, the work highlights the contribution of women leaders in many of the infrastructure categories, inspiring women and men, girls and boys to enter and apply themselves to secure our future infrastructure. Provides insight into women\u2019s contributions to the field of infrastructure and what the issues are with respect to improving the grades across the infrastructure categories as enumerated in the ASCE Report Card; Presents information from academia, research, and industry into advances, applications, and threats for infrastructure; Discusses infrastructure challenges and solutions.",

            "abstract": "\"This book highlights the latest trends and advances in applications of digital technologies in construction engineering and management. A collection of chapters is presented, explicating how advanced technological solutions can innovatively address challenges and improve outcomes in the construction industry. Promising technologies that are highlighted include digital twins, virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. The first section presents recent applications of extended reality technologies for construction education and advanced project control. The subsequent chapters explore Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and BIM-enabled digitalization in construction through a series of case studies, reviews, and technical studies. Innovative technologies and digitalized solutions are proposed for improved design, planning, training, monitoring, inspection, and operations management in Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) contexts. In addition to the technological perspectives and insights presented, pressing issues such as decarbonization, safety and sustainability in the built environment are also discussed. This book provides foundational knowledge and in-depth technical studies on emerging technologies for students, academics, and industry practitioners. The research demonstrates how the effective use of new technologies can enhance work methods, transform organizational structures, and bring profound advantages to construction project participants\"--",

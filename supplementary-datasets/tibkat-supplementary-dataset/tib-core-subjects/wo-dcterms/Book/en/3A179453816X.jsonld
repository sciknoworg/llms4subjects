            "abstract": "Graphene-polymer nanocomposites continue to gain interest in diverse scientific and technological fields. Graphene-based nanomaterials present the advantages of other carbon nanofillers, like electrical and thermal conductivity, while having significantly lower production costs when compared to materials such as carbon nanotubes, for instance. In addition, in the oxidized forms of graphene, the large specific area combined with a large quantity of functionalizable chemical groups available for physical or chemical interaction with polymers, allow for good dispersion and tunable binding with the surrounding matrix. Other features are noteworthy in graphene-based nanomaterials, like their generally good biocompatibility and the ability to absorb near-infrared radiation, allowing for the use in biomedical applications, such as drug delivery and photothermal therapy.This Special Issue provides an encompassing view on the state of the art of graphene-polymer composites, showing how current research is dealing with new and exciting challenges. The published papers cover topics ranging from novel production methods and insights on mechanisms of mechanical reinforcement of composites, to applications as diverse as automotive and aeronautics, cancer treatment, anticorrosive coatings, thermally conductive fabrics and foams, and oil-adsorbent aerogels",

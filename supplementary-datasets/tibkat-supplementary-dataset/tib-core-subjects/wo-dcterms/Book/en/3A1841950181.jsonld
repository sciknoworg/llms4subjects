                "This book focuses on the public pension reform in China from both institutional and empirical studies perspectives. It introduces the process of the public pension reform in China and investigates its effects on households and firms\u2019 behaviors and individuals\u2019 well-being. It provides the reader with rich academic evidence for understanding the transformation of public pension and its effect on the household consumption, participating in risky financial market, and firms\u2019 decision making on wage and employment, as well as individuals\u2019 well-being. The main content of this book comprises three parts: (i) institutional transitions and issues on public pensions in China; (ii) the impact of public pensions on households or firms\u2019 behaviors in China; and (iii) the impact of public pensions on well-being in China. This book provides rich academic evidence about these issues based on economic theories and econometric methods using many kinds of Chinese nationwide representative survey data. This book is highly recommended to readers who are interested in up-to-date and in-depth empirical studies on the issues of public pension reform, and its impact on individuals, households, and firms\u2019 behaviors as well as well-being in China. This book is of interest to those who are interested in the Chinese economy, social security policymakers, and scholars with an econometric analysis background.",

                "This open access book addresses methodological issues related to researching young children\u2019s learning and development, teacher education, and professional development. It pays special attention to research conducted in digital contexts in response to the new societal demands of a global pandemic and crisis. It illustrates and discusses new methods and tools, new study designs, new analysis techniques, and new procedures developed in a time of crisis in two different parts of the world, Australia and Norway. The book suggests that, during the global pandemic, a theoretical crisis in researching children\u2019s development in different contexts has emerged, which has not only created the need for new methods and methodologies, but has opened the space for the development of theory itself. Following a cultural-historical perspective, this book theorises these new approaches to create new theoretical concepts and new ways of researching, better understanding, and efficiently supporting childhoods in a continually changing world. This book is a great resource for researchers and students in the fields of early childhood education and educational psychology. .",

            "abstract": "MEMS technology is increasingly penetrating into our lives and improving our quality of life. In parallel to this, advances in nanotechnology and nanomaterials have been catalyzing the rise of NEMS. Consisting of nine chapters reviewing state-of-the-art technologies and their future trends, this book focuses on the latest development of devices and fabrication processes in the field of these extremely miniaturized electromechanical systems. The book offers new knowledge and insight into design, fabrication, and packaging, as well as solutions in these aspects for targeted applications, aiming to support scientists, engineers and academic trainees who are engaged in relevant research. In the chapters, practical issues and advances are discussed for flexible microdevices, bioMEMS, intelligent implants, optical MEMS, nanomachined structures and NEMS, and others. Most of the chapters also focus on novel fabrication/packaging processes, including silicon bulk micromachining, laser micromachining, nanolithography, and packaging for implantable microelectronics enabled by nanomaterials",

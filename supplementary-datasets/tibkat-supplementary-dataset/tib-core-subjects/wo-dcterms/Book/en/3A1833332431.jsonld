In this book, Johanna Sellman analyses the changing aesthetic and political dimensions of Arabic exile literature and demonstrates how frameworks such as east\u2013west cultural encounters, political commitment and modernist understandings of exile \u2013 which were dominant in 20th-century Arabic exile literature \u2013 have been giving way to writing that explores the dynamics of forced migration and the liminal spaces of borders and borderlands",

            "abstract": "This volume devoted to Kuznetsov's architectural drawings makes a valuable contribution to understanding the work and vision of one of the most interesting protagonists of the new generation of architects from present-day Russia. The practice of drawing is seen to be crucial to the way of thinking about architecture and of observing the contemporary city. It is also a source of inspiration and research, through drawing from life views and images of the many places visited in recent years, which become material for reflection and offer suggestions for metropolitan scenarios of the near future. Sergey Kuznetsov was born in 1977 in Moscow. In 2001 he graduated from the Moscow Architectural Institute. Kuznetsov has taken part in various architecture exhibitions, including international ones. In 2010 and 2012 he was the co-curator of the Russian pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale, which for the first time was awarded with an Honourable Mention prize by the jury in 2012",

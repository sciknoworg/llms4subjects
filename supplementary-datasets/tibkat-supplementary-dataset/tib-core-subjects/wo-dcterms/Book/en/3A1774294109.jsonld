            "abstract": "This report aims to extract lessons on slum upgrading and involuntary resettlement policies and practices learned from the process of addressing the Badia East case, which involved complex interactions between affected people, NGOs, the Bank and Lagos State Government. In doing so, this report will discuss the Local Government Support Programme (LMDGP) as a complex and rich case study from which to extract lessons on involuntary resettlement, land, housing and slum upgrading, as well as overall urban development issues, although it is by no means meant to be an evaluation of the LMDGP project itself nor of process that followed the submission of a request for inspection to the Inspection Panel. Rather, it intends to provide an in-depth analysis of, and make recommendations on urban land and housing issues and the modalities of urban sector engagement in mega-cities like Lagos with inefficient land markets. The report was based on an extensive desk-review of relevant documents on urban issues in Nigeria and Lagos and on the LMDGP; interviews conducted in Lagos and Abuja during the period of January 18-31, 2015 with a range of stakeholders; and a series of case-studies on relevant international experiences in the areas of slum upgrading, involuntary resettlement, land and housing",

            "abstract": "When viewing a circular coin rotated in depth, it fills an elliptical region of the distal scene. For some, this appears to generate a two-fold experience, in which one sees the coin as simultaneously circular (in light of its 3D shape) and elliptical (in light of its 2D \u2018perspectival shape\u2019 or \u2018p-shape\u2019). An energetic philosophical debate asks whether the latter p-shapes are genuinely presented in perceptual experience (as \u2018perspectivalists\u2019 argue) or if, instead, this appearance is somehow derived or inferred from experience (as \u2018anti-perspectivalists\u2019 argue). This debate, however, has largely turned on introspection. In a recent study, Morales et al. (2020) aim to provide the first empirical test of this question. They asked subjects to find an elliptical coin seen face-on from a search array that also included a circular coin seen either face-on or at an angle. They found that subjects reacted more slowly when the distracting circle was seen at an angle, such that its p-shape matched that of the target ellipse. From this, they concluded that the similar p-shape between the ellipse and circle constituted a phenomenal similarity between the two, and thus that perspectivalism is true.  We show that these results can also be explained by pre-attentive guidance by unconscious representations (in what follows, just \u201cunconscious pre-attentive guidance\u201d) and that this explanation is at least as plausible as one from phenomenal similarity. Thus, we conclude that the experiment does not support perspectivalism over anti-perspectivalism",

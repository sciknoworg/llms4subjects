The topics covered include a history of engineers and development, the problems of using industry-based practices when designing for communities, how engineers can prepare to work with communities, and listening in community development. It also includes two case studies--one of engineers developing a windmill for a community in India, and a second of an engineer \"mapping communities\" in Honduras to empower people to use water effectively--and student perspectives and experiences on one curricular model dealing with community development",

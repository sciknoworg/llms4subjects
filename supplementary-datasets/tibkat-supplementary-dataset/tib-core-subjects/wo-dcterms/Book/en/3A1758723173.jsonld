                "\"Most of the conventional dryer uses random heating to dry diverse materials without considering their thermal sensitivity and energy requirement for drying. Eventually, excess energy consumption is required along with attaining low quality dried product. Proper heat and mass transfer modeling prior to designing drying system for selected food materials can overcome these problems. Heat and Mass Transfer Modelling During Drying: Empirical to Multiscale Approaches extensively discusses the issue of prediction of energy consumption in terms of heat and mass transfer simulation. A comprehensive mathematical model can help to get proper insight of the underlying transport phenomena within the materials during drying. However, drying of porous materials like food is one of the most complex problems in the engineering field that also has multiscale nature. In modelling perspective, heat and mass transfer phenomena can be predicted using empirical to multiscale modelling. However, multiscale simulation method can provide comprehensive insight of underlying physics of drying of food materials. The objective of this book is to discuss the implementation of different modelling technique ranging empirical to multiscale in order to understand heat and mass transfer phenomena that take into place during drying of porous materials including food, pharmaceutical products, paper, lather, and more\"--"

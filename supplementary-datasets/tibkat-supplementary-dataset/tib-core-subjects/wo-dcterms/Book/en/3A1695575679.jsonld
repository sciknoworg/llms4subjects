            "abstract": "\"The book titled \"Progress and Prospects in Nanoscience Today\" is an extensive collection of learned materials and new results focusing on advances in nanoscience and nanomaterials for their applications by the contributing authors who are experts working in the fields of nanoscience, material science, energy, agricultural, computer science and engineering, atmospheric nanoscience, medicine, and nanobiotechnology. The book begins with a chapter on \"Science of Nanomaterials\". The formulation of this chapter serves as a foundation and is done in such a fashion that readers from a variety of disciplines with different background and willing to start research in interdisciplinary branch of science and make a career in nanotechnology. The second chapter presents basic concepts and methods of nanoscience, which are needed for human welfare. The first part addresses the function of imaging by scanning probe microscopy. This tool is operating with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution which promotes new views into structures and processes from the molecular to the sub-atomic level. They contribute to fabricate new nano-sized systems and to open up new fields of application that range from novel quantum materials to biosystems and living matter. The third chapter reports the synthesis and physiochemical characteristics of silver nanoparticles. The next thirteen chapters report different properties of nanomaterials for their number of applications. These include: polymer composites in aerospace applications, photoluminescence properties, atmospheric nanoscience, agriculture, supercapacitors, hyperthermia therapy, wound dressing, antimicrobial applications, anti-biofilm-applications, tuberculosis diagnosis etc. The book will be a precious piece and basic knowledge material for those looking for new opportunities in the field of progress and prospects of nanoscience for technology development in different walks of industries. Each chapter is an icon of frontier level high quality research that has been undertaken in synthesis, characterization and application of variety of nanomaterials\"--",

            "abstract": "EPDF and EPUB available Open Access under CC-BY-NC- ND  It has been claimed that we are \u2018all in it together\u2019 and that the COVID-19 virus \u2018does not discriminate\u2019. This accessible, yet authoritative book dispels this myth of COVID-19 as an \u2018equal opportunity\u2019 disease, by showing how the pandemic is a syndemic of disease and inequality.  Drawing on international data and accounts, it argues that the pandemic is unequal in three ways: it has killed unequally, been experienced unequally and will impoverish unequally.   These inequalities are a political choice: with governments effectively choosing who lives and who dies, we need to learn from COVID-19 quickly to prevent growing inequality and to reduce health inequalities in the future.  COVID-19 is an unequal pandemic",

            "abstract": "Plastic Surgery is a fast evolving surgical specialty. Although best known for cosmetic procedures, plastic surgery also involves reconstructive and aesthetic procedures, which very often overlap, aiming to restore functionality and normal appearance of organs damaged due to trauma, neoplasm, ageing tissue or iatrogenesis. First reconstructive procedures were described more than 3000 years ago by Indian surgeons that reconstructed nasal deformities caused by nose amputation as a form of punishment. Nowadays, many ancient procedures are still used like the Indian forehead flap for nasal reconstruction, but as with all fields of medicine, the advances in technology and research have dramatically affected reconstructive surgery",

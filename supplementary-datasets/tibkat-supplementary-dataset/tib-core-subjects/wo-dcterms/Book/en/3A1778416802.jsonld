            "abstract": "In recent years, bioeconomy strategies have been implemented and adapted internationally. In the bioeconomy, materials are to a certain extent circular by nature. However, biomaterials may also be used in a rather linear way. Lately, a transition towards a circular economy, a more restorative and regenerative economic model, is being promoted worldwide. A circular economy offers an alternative model aiming at \u201cdoing more and better with less\u201d. It is based on the idea that circulating matter and energy will diminish the need for new input. Its concept lies in maintaining the value of products, materials, and resources for as long as possible and at the same time minimizing or even eliminating the amount of waste produced. Focused on \u201cclosing the loops\u201d, a circular economy is a practical solution for promoting entrepreneurial sustainability, economic growth, environmental resilience, and a better quality of life for all. The most efficient way to close resource loops is to find value in the waste. Different modes of resource circulation may be applied, e.g., raw materials, by-products, human resources, logistics, services, waste, energy, or water. To that end, this Special Issue seeks to contribute to the circular bioeconomy agenda through enhanced scientific and multidisciplinary knowledge to boost the performance efficiency of circular business models and support decision-making within the specific field. The Special Issue includes innovative technical developments, reviews, and case studies, all of which are relevant to green, closed-loop, circular bioeconomy",

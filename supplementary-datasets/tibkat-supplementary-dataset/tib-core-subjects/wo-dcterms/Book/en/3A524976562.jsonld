                "An important aspect of wireless networks is the deployment of their infrastructure. In this book, the Editors have invited a number of experts from industry to write on a variety of topics associated with deployment of digital wireless networks. The first part of the book consists of an overview of systems design and engineering integration, comparison of polarization and space diversity antenna systems, and the performance of deploying smart antenna architectures in cellular and PCS networks. The second part addresses deployment of CDMA networks, based on IS-95 standards. Here the authors discuss issues related to optimization of overlaid dual model CDMA networks, embedding microcells to improve hot-spot capacity, and mitigation of intermodulation distortion in handsets. Part III deals with deployment of TDMA- based networks. The issues presented include developing hierarchical systems, reconfigurable transceivers, and deploying the GSM frequency hopping feature for enhancing existing traffic capacity. The last part, on Wireless Data Networks, is comprised of issues related to the performance of GPRS systems deployed as an upgrade on current networks and deployment of wireless LANs. Critical issues for deploying an IEEE 802.11-based WLAN are examined. Wireless Network Deployments provides practical engineering guidance for wireless and cellular engineers, researchers, technicians, and managers working in second and third generation digital wireless networks.",

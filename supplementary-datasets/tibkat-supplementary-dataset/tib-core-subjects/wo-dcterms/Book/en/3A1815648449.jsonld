            "abstract": "This book presents the latest developments in the field of biomedical engineering and includes practical solutions and strictly scientific considerations. The development of new methods of treatment, advanced diagnostics or personalized rehabilitation requires close cooperation of experts from many fields, including, among others, medicine, biotechnology and finally biomedical engineering. The latter, combining many fields of science, such as computer science, materials science, biomechanics, electronics not only enables the development and production of modern medical equipment, but also participates in the development of new directions and methods of treatment. The presented monograph is a collection of scientific papers on the use of engineering methods in medicine. The topics of the work include both practical solutions and strictly scientific considerations expanding knowledge about the functioning of the human body. We believe that the presented works will have an impact on the development of the field of science, which is biomedical engineering, constituting a contribution to the discussion on the directions of development of cooperation between doctors, physiotherapists and engineers. We would also like to thank all the people who contributed to the creation of this monograph\u2014both the authors of all the works and those involved in technical works.",

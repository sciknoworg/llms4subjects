            "title": "Chapter 3 National Myths and Language Status in Early Modern Wales and Brittany",
            "abstract": [
                "This chapter explores how the revision of national myths in Early Modern Britain and France reflects conflicts and contradictions between the perspectives of the dominant nations, England and France, and those of two subordinate nations, Wales and Brittany, formally annexed by their larger neighbours in the 16th century, and how the national myths in turn impinged on the status of the vernacular languages of the subordinate nations, Welsh and Breton. In order to legitimise the new Church of England, English protestant apologists claimed that its protestant faith was the continuation of the pure faith of the Early Church, which the ancient Britons, ancestors of the Welsh, had acquired directly from a disciple of Christ. Richard Davies\u2019 preface to the 1567 Welsh New Testament, however, re-appropriated the narrative as specifically Welsh. Davies\u2019 narrative was influential in Wales and contributed to a cultural context, together with the Welsh Bible translation, in which the Welsh language could flourish despite the increasing dominance of English. In the case of Brittany and France, the paper explores the contradiction between the antiquarian prestige conferred upon Breton by contemporary language antiquity myths and its actual subordinate sociolinguistic status vis-a-vis French",
                "\"In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the linguistic situation in Europe was one of remarkable fluidity. Latin, the great scholarly lingua franca of the medieval period, was beginning to crack as the tectonic plates shifted beneath it, but the vernaculars had not yet crystallized into the national languages that they would later become, and multilingualism was rife. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, languages were coming into contact with an intensity that they had never had before, influencing each other and throwing up all manner of hybrids and pidgins as peoples tried to communicate using the semiotic resources they had available. Of interest to linguists, literary scholars and historians, amongst others, this interdisciplinary volume explores the linguistic dynamics operating in Europe and beyond in the crucial centuries between 1400 and 1800. Assuming a state of individual, societal and functional multilingualism, when codeswitching was the norm, and languages themselves were fluid, unbounded and porous, it explores the shifting relationships that existed between various tongues in different geographical contexts, as well as some of the myths and theories that arose to make sense of them\"--"

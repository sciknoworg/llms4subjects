            "abstract": "\"The practice of engineering dynamics is a textbook that takes a systematic approach to understanding dynamic analysis of mechanical systems. It comprehensively covers dynamic analysis of systems from equilibrium states to non-linear simulations and presents frequency analysis of experimental data. It divides the practice of engineering dynamics into three parts: Part 1 - Modelling : Deriving equations of motion ; Part 2 - Simulation : Using the equations of motion ; and Part 3- Experimental frequency domain analysis. This approach fulfills the need to be able to derive the equations governing the motion of a system, to then use the equations to provide useful design information, and finally to be able to analyze experimental data measured on dynamic systems. The practice of engineering dynamics includes end of chapter exercises and is accompanied by a website hosting a solutions manual. Dynamics is a branch of physics (specifically classical mechanics) concerned with the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion, as opposed to kinematics, which studies the motion of objects without reference to its causes. Generally speaking, researchers involved in dynamics study how a physical system might develop or alter over time and study the causes of those changes. In addition, Newton established the fundamental physical laws which govern dynamics in physics. By studying his system of mechanics, dynamics can be understood. In particular, dynamics is mostly related to Newton's second law of motion. However, all three laws of motion are taken into matter because these are interrelated in any given observation or experiment\"--",

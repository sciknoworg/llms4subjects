                "\"During the last few decades, many environmental and hydrological problems have been represented and studied through data analysis and machine learning models. Machine learning evolves rapidly with new algorithms and new tools. Nowadays, complex problems are analyzed by identifying and explaining patterns and anomalies of measured or simulated data. Understanding hydrological characteristics and subsequently predicting spatiotemporal hydrological events has developed largely. Temporal information is sometimes limited; spatial information, on the other hand, has increased in recent years due to technological advances including the availability of remote sensing data. These developments have motivated new research efforts to include data in model representation and analysis. Also, current trends and variability of hydrological extremes call for novel approaches of spatio-temporal and machine learning analysis to assess, predict, and manage water-related and/or interlinked hazards including the assessment of uncertainties\"--",
                "Advanced Hydroinformatics Advanced Hydroinformatics Machine Learning and Optimization for Water Resources The rapid development of machine learning brings new possibilities for hydroinformatics research and practice with its ability to handle big data sets, identify patterns and anomalies in data, and provide more accurate forecasts. Advanced Hydroinformatics: Machine Learning and Optimization for Water Resources presents both original research and practical examples that demonstrate how machine learning can advance data analytics, accuracy of modeling and forecasting, and knowledge discovery for better water management. Volume Highlights Include: Overview of the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in hydroinformaticsAdvances in modeling hydrological systemsDifferent data analysis methods and models for forecasting water resourcesNew areas of knowledge discovery and optimization based on using machine learning techniquesCase studies from North America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia The American Geophysical Union promotes discovery in Earth and space science for the benefit of humanity. Its publications disseminate scientific knowledge and provide resources for researchers, students, and professionals"

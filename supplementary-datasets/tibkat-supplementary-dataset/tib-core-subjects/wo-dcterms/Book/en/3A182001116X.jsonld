                "This book examines the construction of the EU\u2019s political identity (or identities), variations in its strength, and the nature of its content. Drawing on studies both on European nation-state formation and on the EU\u2019s identity, the chapters take a top-down approach and analyse how EU institutions in different major policy domains have themselves sought to create political identity through policy making. The authors define the construction of EU political identity and set out empirically applicable indicators to assess political identity in policy making. They analyse the construction of identity through a process-oriented approach that explicitly includes contestation and the existence of rival political identities. Comparing across policy domains, the contributions suggest that the ability of EU institutions to construct an EU political identity has been limited not only by existing national identities but also by the coexistence of rival EU political identities within policy domains. Hence, it has been difficult for EU institutions to establish a strong identity, with identity being strongest where there are clear external alternatives and limited rival identities within the EU. Sabine Saurugger is Professor of Political Science at Sciences Po Grenoble, France, and Research Fellow at the Institut Universitaire de France. Mark Thatcher is Professor of Political Science at Luiss University Rome, Italy, and Visiting Professor at LSE, UK."

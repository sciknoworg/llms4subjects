            "abstract": "Subjects and Aliens confronts the problematic history of                    belonging in Australia and New Zealand. In both countries, race has often been                    more important than the law in determining who is considered 'one of                    us'. Each chapter in the collection highlights the lived experiences of                    people who negotiated laws and policies relating to nationality and citizenship                    rights in twentieth-century Australasia, including Chinese Australians enlisting                    during the First World War, Dalmatian gum-diggers turned farmers in New Zealand,                    Indians in 1920s Australia arguing for their citizenship rights, and Australian                    women who lost their nationality after marrying non-British subjects. The book                    also considers how the legal belonging\u2014and accompanying rights and                    protections\u2014of First Nations people has been denied, despite the High Court of                    Australia\u2019s recent assertion (in the landmark Love & Thoms case of 2020)                    that Aboriginal people have never been considered \u2018aliens\u2019 or \u2018foreigners\u2019 since                    1788. The experiences of world-famous artist Albert Namatjira, and of those made                    to apply for \u2018certificates of citizenship\u2019 under Western Australian law, suggest                    otherwise. Subjects and Aliens demonstrates how people who legally belonged were                    denied rights and protections as citizens through the actions of those who                    created, administered and interpreted the law across the twentieth century, and                    how the legal ramifications of those actions can still be felt today",

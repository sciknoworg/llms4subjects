                "\u201cWith major global and regional power balances shifting dramatically, understanding what drives Indian foreign policy has never been more important. In this ambitious and thought-provoking study, the author identifies pluralism, tolerance, non-violence and hierarchy as cultural values that have long been most influential and remain so today. Enlivened by case studies of nuclear policy, humanitarian intervention and the Middle East, this book will appeal not only to international relations theorists but also practical policymakers.\u201c \u2014 Professor the Hon. Gareth Evans AC QC, Former Foreign Minister of Australia, Distinguished Honorary Professor, Australian National University and President Emeritus of the International Crisis Group \u201dDr. Pethiyagoda\u2019s fine volume, drawing on India\u2019s rich history, diversity of cultures and rising geo-strategic importance, greatly enhances the fast-growing field of Indian foreign policy scholarship.\u201d \u2014 Dr David M. Malone, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, Rector, UN University, Author of Does the Elephant Dance: Contemporary Indian Foreign Policy and Former Canadian Ambassador to India As India rises to great power status in the emerging multipolar world order, what influence will its rich and ancient culture have on the country\u2019s foreign policy? This book reveals that cultural values have greater explanatory power than previously thought and describes the nature of their influence. Excavating thousands of years of history, the monograph identifies enduring values that are relevant to contemporary foreign policy. It examines three critical areas of Indian foreign policy \u2013 nuclear policy, humanitarian intervention and relations with the Middle East. Major decisions were shaped by cultural values \u2013 sometimes at the expense of strategic interests. India\u2019s choice to test nuclear weapons was not purely because of China or Pakistan: hierarchy also played a role. From a hierarchical worldview shaping Delhi\u2019s approach to international law on arms control to pluralism facilitating simultaneous friendships with America and Iran, values thread their way throughout India\u2019s foreign relations. Non-violence underpins Delhi\u2019s soft power in both the West and the Middle East, while having spurred India\u2019s opposition to Western intervention in Iraq. Analyzing state behavior and interviewing diplomats, the book charts culture\u2019s evolving influence from Rajiv Gandhi to Narendra Modi. Kadira Pethiyagoda was a Brookings Institution Fellow, diplomat, foreign service officer, political candidate, and visiting scholar at University of Oxford, UK."

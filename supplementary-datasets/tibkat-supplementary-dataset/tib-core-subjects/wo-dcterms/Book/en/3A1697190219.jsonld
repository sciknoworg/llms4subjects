                "This book provides an account of the classical and recent trends in plant sciences, which have contributed for disease management strategies in plants for sustainable agriculture. Advancements in the disciplines of biological sciences like biotechnology, microbiology, bioinformatics as well as information and communication technology etc has given the new dimensions for the development of new plant disease management strategies. By keeping this perspective in view, the editors collected and compiled the useful, practical and recent information regarding plant disease management from a diverse group of authors from different countries associated with well-reputed scientific, teaching and research organizations with the objective to update and equip the researchers with comprehensive and latest knowledge of plant disease management. This book is based on the knowledge of traditional and modern approaches for plant disease management. It has 15 chapters, each chapter describing the pillar strategies, which may be the possible way for crop protection from diseases. This effort deals with the history and recent trends in plant disease control, plant genetics and physiology in disease prognosis, conventional plant breeding program for disease resistance, synthetic chemicals: major component of plant disease management, biological antagonism: expected safe and sustainable way to manage plant diseases , soil microbes and plant health, conventional and modern technologies for the management of post-harvest diseases, nanobiotechnology, an innovative plant disease management approach, transgenic approaches in plants: strategic control for disease management, exploiting RNAi mechanism in plants for disease resistance, genome editing technologies for resistance against phytopathogens: principles, applications and future prospects, plant health clinics in Pakistan: operations and prospects, precision agriculture technologies for management of plant disease, quarantine and regulations and development and implementation of IDM program for annual and perennial crops."

            "abstract": "This paper provides a compressive synthesis of the most recent and widely cited literature on the effects of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) adoption at the country, firm, and individual levels. The study surveys and analyzes the available literature on the topics of economic growth and transformation, and highlights the main conclusions drawn by scholars, areas of ongoing debate, and remaining research questions that need to be addressed in future work. The adoption of ICTs has been found to contribute to higher GDP growth in many countries, although the exact mechanism of its impact on macroeconomic growth is still uncertain. At the firm level, digital technology has been shown to increase productivity, but it also intensifies competition and may result in job losses in certain industries or occupations. In terms of labor conditions, ICTs can provide more flexible work arrangements which could improve workers' welfare, but it can also lead to job insecurity and wage stagnation. At the individual level, digital technology can provide access to more knowledge and services, thereby improving welfare in areas such as health and education. In conclusion, ICTs adoption can have both positive and negative effects, depending on how it is understood by researchers, impacted by the private sector and regulated by governments. Policymakers in developing countries should consider these factors when designing policies to promote digital technology adoption. The effects of ICTs adoption at the macroeconomic, firm, and individual levels should be thoroughly evaluated to ensure that the benefits outweigh the potential negative consequences",

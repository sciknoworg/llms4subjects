This is the first publication of an English translation of Jean-Luc Nancy\u2019s acclaimed consideration of the law\u2019s most pervasive principles in the context of actual systems and contemporary institutions, power, norms, laws. In a world where it is clearly impossible to imagine the realization of an ideal of justice that corresponds to every person\u2019s ideal of justice, Nancy probes the limits of legal normativity starting from this problem. Moreover, the question is asked: how can legal normativity be legitimized? A legal order based on performativity and formal validity is questionable and forces below that of juridical normativity are at the heart of Dies Irae\u2019s critical inquiry. This leads inevitably to the processes of inclusion and exclusion that characterize contemporary juridical systems and those issues of identity, hostility and self-representation so central to contemporary European and global political and legal debates",

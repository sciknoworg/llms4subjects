            "abstract": "The rising shortage of water resources in crop-producing regions worldwide and the need for irrigation optimisation call for sustainable water savings. The allocation of irrigation water will be an ever-increasing source of pressure because of vast agricultural demands under changing climatic conditions. Consequently, irrigation has to be closely linked with water-use efficiency with the aim of boosting productivity and improving food quality, singularly in those regions where problems of water shortages or collection and delivery are widespread. The present Special Issue (SI) showcases 19 original contributions, addressing water-use efficiency in the context of sustainable irrigation management to meet water scarcity conditions. These papers cover a wide range of subjects including (i) interaction mineral nutrition and irrigation in horticultural crops, (ii) sustainable irrigation in woody fruit crops, (iii) medicinal plants, (iv) industrial crops, and (v) other topics devoted to remote sensing techniques and crop water requirements, genotypes for drought tolerance, and agricultural management. The studies were carried out in both field and laboratory surveys, with modelling studies also being conducted, and a wide range of geographic regions are also covered. The collection of these manuscripts presented in this SI updates on and provides a relevant contribution for efficient saving water resources",

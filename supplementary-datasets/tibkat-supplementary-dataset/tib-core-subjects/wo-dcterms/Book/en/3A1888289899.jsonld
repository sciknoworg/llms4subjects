                "This book provides the latest research and technology advances in building fire safety and smart firefighting. Different experts systemically review the application of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Virtual Reality, Digitalization, and Metaverse in fire safety areas. These multi-disciplinary research and technology fusion will significantly change the fire resilience design and firefighting practices in the next 20 years. Achieving urban fire safety and resilience also plays a key role in developing future smart buildings and cities. This book attracts more young researchers into the latest multi-disciplinary fire safety research and promotes the application of the new technologies in firefighting.",

                "\u201cThis excellent volume in the memory of the late Professor Fred Nixson brings together authoritative contributions from a diverse range of scholars on the political economy of global manufacturing, business and finance.\u201d \u2014 Kunal Sen, World Institute for Development Economics Research, United Nations University, Finland. \u201cThis is a highly recommended volume on the state of the art in terms of understanding contemporary economic development in developing countries.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Sumner, Professor of International Development, King\u2019s College London, Department of International Development, UK. \u201cThis book offers a refreshing perspective on industrial development, multinational firms, international trade, inequality, and financial development.\u201d \u2014 C\u00e9line Az\u00e9mar, Professor of Economics, Academic Dean, Rennes School of Business, France. \u201cPowerful insights into why inequality and transformation are central to the study and practice of development \u2013 a fitting tribute to the legacy of Fred Nixson.\u201d \u2014 David Luke, Professor in Practice and Strategic Director, Firoz Lalji Institute for Africa, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK. This book is written as a tribute to Frederick Nixson\u2019s extensive work on industrial development in the Global South, while seeking to actively engage with the latest arguments concerning development economics, together with changes in manufacturing and industrial policy that continue to shape the role of the Global South in the international economy, the impact of the increased concentration of global multinational corporations in that space, along with the rise of new financing tools and debt traps. The chapters pay homage to Fred\u2019s broad view of the international development process and reflect his breadth of perception both theoretically and geographically. The book targets both the scholarly and policymaking audience. Michael Tribe is a Business School Affiliate, Department of Economics, Adam Smith Business School, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom. George Kararach is a Lead Economist with the African Development Bank Group and Visiting Professor, Wits School of Governance, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa.",

            "abstract": "This open access book crosses disciplinary boundaries to connect theories of environmental justice with Indigenous people\u2019s experiences of freshwater management and governance. It traces the history of one freshwater crisis \u2013 the degradation of Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s Waip\u0101 River\u2013 to the settler-colonial acts of ecological dispossession resulting in intergenerational injustices for Indigenous M\u0101ori iwi (tribes). The authors draw on a rich empirical base to document the negative consequences of imposing Western knowledge, worldviews, laws, governance and management approaches onto M\u0101ori and their ancestral landscapes and waterscapes. Importantly, this book demonstrates how degraded freshwater systems can and are being addressed by M\u0101ori seeking to reassert their knowledge, authority, and practices of kaitiakitanga (environmental guardianship). Co-governance and co-management agreements between iwi and the New Zealand Government, over the Waip\u0101 River, highlight how M\u0101ori are envisioning and enacting more sustainable freshwater management and governance, thus seeking to achieve Indigenous environmental justice (IEJ). The book provides an accessible way for readers coming from a diversity of different backgrounds, be they academics, students, practitioners or decision-makers, to develop an understanding of IEJ and its applicability to freshwater management and governance in the context of changing socio-economic, political, and environmental conditions that characterise the Anthropocene",

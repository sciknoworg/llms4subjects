            "title": "Numerical Analysis and Modelling of Composite Materials",
            "abstract": "Composite materials are increasingly used in many applications because they offer the engineer a range of advantages over traditional materials. They are often used in situations where a specified level of performance is required, but where the cost of testing the materials under the extremes of those specifications is very high. In order to solve this problem, engineers are turning to computer Modelling to evaluate the materials under the range of conditions they are likely to encounter. Many of these analyses are carried out in isolation, and yet the evaluation of a range of composites can be carried out using the same basic principles. In this new book the editor has brought together an international panel of authors, each of whom is working on the analysis and Modelling of composite materials. The overage of the book is deliberately wide; to illustrate that similar principles and methods can be used to model and evaluate a wide range of materials. It is also hoped that, by bringing together this range of topics, the insight gained in the study of one composite can be recognized and utilized in the study of others. Professional engineers involved in the specification and testing of composite material structures will find this book an invaluable resource in the course of their work. It will also be of interest to those industrial and academic engineers involved in the design, development, manufacture and applications of composite materials",

            "abstract": "As the global banking boom of the early twenty-first century expanded towards implosion, Icelandic media began calling the country\u2019s celebrity financiers \u00fatr\u00e1sarv\u00edkingar: \u201craiding vikings.\u201d This new coinage encapsulated the macho, medievalist nationalism which underwrote Iceland\u2019s exponential financialisation. Yet within a few days in October 2008, Iceland saw all its main banks collapse beneath debts worth nearly ten times the country\u2019s GDP.Hall charts how Icelandic novelists and poets grappled with the Crash over the ensuing decade. As the first English-language monograph devoted to twenty-first-century Icelandic literature, it provides Anglophone readers with an introduction to one of the world\u2019s liveliest literary scenes. It also contributes a key case study for understanding global artistic responses to the early twenty-first century crisis of runaway, unregulated capitalism, exploring the struggles of writers to adapt realist forms of art to surreal times.As Iceland\u2019s biggest crisis since their independence from Denmark in 1944, the effect of the Crash on the national self-image was as seismic as its effects on the economy. This study analyses the centrality of whiteness and the abjection of the \u201cdeveloping world\u201d in Iceland\u2019s post-colonial identity, and shows how Crash-writing explores the collisions of Iceland\u2019s traditional, nationalist medievalism with a dystopian, Orientalist medievalism associated with the Islamic world.The Crash in Iceland was instantly recognised as offering important economic insights. This book shows how Iceland also helps us to understand the cultural convulsions that have followed the Financial Crisis widely in the West",

            "abstract": "Never has the reality of climate change and its ramifications been so obvious around the world. Humankind is currently living in times when the reality of global climate change is unequivocal. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR6 report further depicts the veracity of climate change by highlighting historically changing patterns of precipitation and temperature across the world, amidst heightened and varied levels of vulnerability around the world. This book is planned along the increasingly complex and daunting nature of climate change. The broad scope is intentional and aims at eliciting scholarship from across the globe and from varied areas of climate change research. Thus, as varied and broad as the intentions are, so too are the book\u2019s contents. The thirteen peer-reviewed chapters are organized into four sections. Section 1 introduces the concept of climate change and other global perspectives and trends. Section 2 focuses on climate risk, resilience, and vulnerability. Section 3 explores varied perspectives on climate risks, sensitivity, and exposure with a focus on monitoring and assessment. Finally, Section 4 explores climate change adaptation and mitigation. The multidisciplinary nature of this book will appeal to a varied readership including governments, municipal authorities, and daily grassroots users of environmental resources",

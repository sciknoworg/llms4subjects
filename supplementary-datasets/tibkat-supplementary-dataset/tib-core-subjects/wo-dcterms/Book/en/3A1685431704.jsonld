            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Calcium and comparable cations are fast being recognised for their role as vital components of animal physiology. When trying to answer questions such as why salmon can adjust to life in fresh water as well as seawater, or why chilli peppers taste hot to humans but evoke little response from chickens, we often find the answers lie in patterns of movement of these ions and their roles in sensing, transmitting and collecting messages. Bringing together scattered literature on calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium in biology, this book examines important biological contributions of these ions including enzyme activation, effects in all types of muscle and biomineralization. Attention is focused on: channel construction and ion movement; calcium as a second messenger and in the construction of solids and ion channelopathies, with the help of personalities such as Agatha Christie, van Gogh and Captain Cook. The Role of Calcium and Comparable Cations in Animal Behaviour will be valued by a wide-range of readers including students of bioinorganic chemistry and animal behavioural studies, teachers and other professionals in academia",

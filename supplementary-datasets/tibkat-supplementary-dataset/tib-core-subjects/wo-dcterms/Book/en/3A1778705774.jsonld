            "abstract": "During last couple of years there has been an increasing recognition that problems arising in biology or related to medicine really need a multidisciplinary approach. For this reason some special branches of both applied theoretical physics and mathematics have recently emerged such as biomechanics, mechanobiology, mathematical biology, biothermodynamics. The Biomechanics in Application is focusing on experimental praxis and clinical findings. The first section is devoted to Injury and clinical biomechanics including overview of the biomechanics of musculoskeletal injury, distraction osteogenesis in mandible, or consequences of drilling. The next section is on Spine biomechanics with biomechanical models for upper limb after spinal cord injury and an animal model looking at changes occurring as a consequence of spinal cord injury. Section Musculoskeletal Biomechanics includes the chapter which is devoted to dynamical stability of lumbo-pelvi-femoral complex which involves analysis of relationship among appropriate anatomical structures in this region. The fourth section is on Human and Animal Biomechanics with contributions from foot biomechanics and chewing rhythms in mammals, or adaptations of bats. The last section, Sport Biomechanics, is discussing various measurement techniques for assessment and analysis of movement and two applications in swimming",

The Special Issue \"Analysis, Design and Fabrication of Micromixers II\" published in Micromachines covers new mechanisms, numerical and/or experimental mixing analysis, design, and fabrication of various micromixers. This reprint includes an editorial, two review papers, and eleven research papers reporting on five active and six passive micromixers. Three of the active micromixers have electrokinetic driving force, but the other two are activated by mechanical mechanism and acoustic streaming. Three studies employs non-Newtonian working fluids, one of which deals with nano-non-Newtonian fluids. Most of the cases investigated micromixer design",

            "title": "Scaling Migrant Worker Rights : How Advocates Collaborate and Contest State Power",
            "abstract": "International migrants\u2019 home countries often play an integral part in protecting their citizens\u2019 labor and human rights abroad. At the same time, institutions such as labor unions, worker centers, and legal aid groups are among the most visible actors holding governments of immigrant destinations accountable. Focusing on Mexico and the United States, Scaling Migrant Worker Rights analyzes how these organizations pressure governments to defend migrants. The result is a multilayered picture of the impediments to migrant worker rights and the possibilities for their realization. \u201cHighly original and timely, this book shines a light on underexplored actors in the labor rights and protection enforcement process.\u201d \u2014 LEAH F. VOSKO, author of Disrupting Deportability: Transnational Workers Organize \u201cA very robust and nuanced empirical analysis documenting how co-enforcement mechanisms across transnational civil society, consulates, and national governments work to implement existing labor rights protections.\u201d \u2014 ALEXANDRA D\u00c9LANO ALONSO, author of Mexico and Its Diaspora in the United States: Policies of Emigration since 1848 \u201cThis important and innovative work provides a nuanced, rich, and detailed meso-analysis of institutions and institutional collaboration in Mexico and the US.\u201d \u2014 NANCY PLANKEY-VIDELA, author of We Are in This Dance Together: Gender, Power, and Globalization at a Mexican Garment Firm",

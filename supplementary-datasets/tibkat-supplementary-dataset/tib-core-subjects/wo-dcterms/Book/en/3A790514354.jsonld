                "More than ever, women are achieving outstanding levels of professional success. Whether CEOs, board members, entrepreneurs, or high performers, women are a game-changing force in the global economy. But women want and need to be paid appropriately for their contributions--no matter what rung of the ladder they're on. There has never been a stronger focus on women's pay than now, from politicians to activists to corporate America. Rise to the Top is written from the inside perspective of a leading female executive-compensation advisor who understands how pay is determined and rewards and benefits are granted in corporate America.  Rise to the Top:  Discusses how companies approach compensation--the compensation game and its many players plus women's roles in that process  Highlights the integral role that personality type plays in how women are perceived in the workplace and how their work style affects their paycheck  Reveals the four female \"powerhouse personality types\" and shares specific strategies on how women can leverage these work styles to earn more money and rewards  Whatever your level of accomplishment or position, Rise to the Top will help you earn what you deserve!",

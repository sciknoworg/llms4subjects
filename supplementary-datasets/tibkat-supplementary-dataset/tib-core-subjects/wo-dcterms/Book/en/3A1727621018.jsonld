            "abstract": "Blasting is currently the technology with significant application in practice with a variety of materials used as blasting media. The scientific-pedagogical team of Department of Mechanical Technology and Materials, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia, focuses on the theoretical basics of blasting process in terms of cleaning and roughening effect focusing on wide range of metallic and non-metallic blasting media. The achieved results were obtained during the completion of a number of research tasks at different levels, completion of tasks for manufacturing practice as well as through dissertations and theses. Original findings contained in this monograph will contribute to expanding of the knowledge base of scientific researchers as well as to the transfer of the research results into practice. The monograph will serve as a source of scientific and technical information for scientific researchers, workers of technical institutes and the general scientific community. Keyword: Abrasive Blast Cleaning Engineers delve into technicalities of blast cleaning surfaces as a pretreatment for a subsequent surface modification such as coating. The effectiveness of the blasting depends on a number of variables, they say, including the equipment used and the medium used for blasting. They cover blasting media, characteristics of blast cleaning surface quality, and the surface treatment of metals by coating application. Among the topics are the influence of the blasting medium on the quality of the blasted surface, determining surface coverage, the micro-geometry of a blasted surface, strengthening the base material by blasting, changes in mechanical and technological properties, and evaluating the properties of a coating system. \u2014 Materials science\u2014 Physics",

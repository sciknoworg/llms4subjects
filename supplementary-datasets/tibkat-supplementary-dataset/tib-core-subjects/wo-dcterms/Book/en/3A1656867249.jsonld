                "This book presents the fundamentals of PLCs and explains in a practical approach how to draw Ladder Logic diagrams to represent PLC design methods for wide variety of automated applications. Building Arduino PLCs starts by explaining how to build and test a simple Arduino-based 5V DC PLC with Arduino hardware and Grove base shield. You'll then learn how to build 12V DC PLC with Arduino hardware, relays, and various passive components. Then the final part of the book will show readers how to control 120v/240V applications with PLCs by enhancing the design with optocouplers and relays. The Arduino development environment, including Arduino UNO, Arduino Ethernet board, Arduino Ethernet shield, and Arduino WiFi shield are also featured in building a set of simple to complex PLCs",
                "Learn the fundamentals of PLCs and how to control them using Arduino software to create your first Arduino PLC. You will learn how to draw Ladder Logic diagrams to represent PLC designs for a wide variety of automated applications and to convert the diagrams to Arduino sketches.A comprehensive shopping guide includes the hardware and software components you need in your tool box. You will learn to use Arduino UNO, Arduino Ethernet shield, and Arduino WiFi shield. Building Arduino PLCsshows you how to build and test a simple Arduino UNO-based 5V DC logic level PLC with Grove Base shield by connecting simple sensors and actuators. You will also learn how to build industry-grade PLCs with the help of ArduiBox. What You'll LearnBuild ModBus-enabled PLCs Map Arduino PLCs into the cloud using NearBus cloud connector to control the PLC through the Internet Use do-it-yourself light platforms such as IFTTT Enhance your PLC by adding Relay shields for connecting heavy loads Who This Book Is ForEngineers, designers, crafters, and makers. Basic knowledge in electronics and Arduino programming or any other programming language is recommended.  Pradeeka Seneviratne is a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in computer programming and systems designing. He loves programming embedded systems such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Pradeeka started learning about electronics when he was at primary college by reading and testing various electronic projects found in newspapers, magazines, and books. Pradeeka is currently a full-time software engineer who works with highly-scalable technologies. Previously, he worked as a software engineer for several IT infrastructure and technology servicing companies, and he was also a teacher for information technology and Arduino development. He researches how to make Arduino-based unmanned aerial vehicles and Raspberry Pi-based security cameras and is the author of the Internet of Things with Arduino Blueprints[Packt Publishing]"

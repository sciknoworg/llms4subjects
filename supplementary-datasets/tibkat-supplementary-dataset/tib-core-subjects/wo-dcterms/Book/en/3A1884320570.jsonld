            "abstract": "\"The use of tailored functional materials has grown enormously in recent years due to their wide-ranging applications in both science and engineering. This new volume presents tailoring and characterization of modern materials with functional applications and for use in clean technologies in different sectors. It covers new topics in nanotechnology, nanoscience, biopolymers, energy, carbon nanotubes, solid materials, biomaterials, and biomedical and healthcare for contributing to a greener environment. This unique research-oriented volume can be used as a reference book in science and applications of tailored functional materials in an inclusive manner for postgraduate students in materials science and chemical engineering. Tailored Functional Materials for Clean and Sustainable Development is divided into four main parts. In the first part, the volume explains why the unique features of tailored nanomaterials make them ideal candidates for applications in biosensor technology, pathogenic microbe detection, and modification of polyester-based polymers. Several chapters summarize polymer functionalization and their applications in medical science and engineering. The volume also provides an understanding of tailored custom-designed solids along with computational chemistry, showing how the fast growth in solid materials has influenced different engineering sectors. With the inclusion of case studies in materials science, the volume explains how tailored materials can be prepared and utilized as application-oriented composites. The volume also discusses some major innovations in tailored energy materials, which focuses on their techno-commercial applications.\"--",

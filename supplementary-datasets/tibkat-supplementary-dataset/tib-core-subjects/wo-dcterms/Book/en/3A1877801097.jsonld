            "abstract": "The Disciples of Christ, led by reformers such as Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone, was one of a number of early-19th-century primitivist religious movements seeking to \"restore the ancient order of things.\" The Disciples movement was little more than a loose collection of independent congregations until the middle of the 19th century, but by 1900 three clear groupings of churches had appeared. Today, more than 5 million Americans\u2014members of the modern-day Disciples of Christ (Christian Church), Independent Christian Churches, and Churches of Christ, among others\u2014trace their religious heritage to this \"Restoration Movement.\"",

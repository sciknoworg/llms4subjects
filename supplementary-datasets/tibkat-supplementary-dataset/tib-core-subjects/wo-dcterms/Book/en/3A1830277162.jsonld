The aim is to introduce mathematics in an up-to-date text that supports the reader/target group to see, easily accessible, ways to approach their questions/problems, meanwhile getting familiar with, often short, mathematical/logical reasoning. The layout is designed so that the theory, applications, and examples are in correlation with each other. The book covers crucial concepts of whole calculus, linear and abstract algebra, as well as analysis, applied math, mathematical statistics, and numerical analysis. Most of the complex theorems appear in a simplified form without affecting their context. There are appendices with Mathematica and Math-Lab programming, which contain programs of simple character for educational purposes, as well as some more involved ones designed to solve problems of more real application\"--",

            "abstract": "This book contains publications related to the special topic entitled: \"The Latest Scientific Problems Related to the Implementation and Diagnostics of Construction Objects\". Construction is a sector of the economy that is characterized by a very high variability of execution conditions and a large variety of building structures. In a period of very rapid economic development, this high variability and diversity generates many new scientific problems that must be solved in order to further improve the quality of production, as well as to reduce the cost and time of construction. The purpose of the issue is to present and discuss the results of the latest research in the broad field of construction engineering, particularly concerning: modification of the composition of construction materials using various micro- and nanomaterials, by-products or wastes; modern methods of controlling construction processes; methods of planning and effective management in construction, as well as methods of diagnosing construction objects. The articles published in this issue deal with theoretical, experimental, applied and modeling research conducted worldwide in the above-mentioned scientific areas",

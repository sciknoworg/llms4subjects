            "abstract": "This twenty-eighth volume in Erasmus' Opera omnia (ASD) is the fifth within'ordo' VI, that is the corda' of the New Testament and the Annotations. The divisioninto 'ordines' - each 'ordo' being devoted to a specific literary or thematiccategory - was laid down by Erasmus himself for the posthumous publication ofhis works (see General introduction, ASD I, pp. x, xvii-xviii, and C. Reedijk, Tcmdembona causa triumphat. Zur Geschichte des Gesamtwerkes des Erasmus von Rotterdam.Vortrage der Aeneas-Silvius-Stiftung an der Universitiit Basel, XVI,Basel/Stuttgart, 1980, p. 12 sqq., 21-22).The present volume (tom. VI, 5, edited by P. F. Hovingh, Rotterdam) containsthe first part of the Annotationes in Nouum Testamentum, to wit the Annotationson Matthew, Mark and Luke. The Annotations on the other books of theNew Testament will be published in ASD VI, 6-9. ASD VI, 1-4 will compriseErasmus' edition of the New Testament (Greek and Latin). The order of publicationdepends on when the respective volumes are finished. With regard to theedition of 'ordo' VI the Editorial Board is much indebted to Professor H. J. deJonge (Leiden) for his expert advice.The Editorial Board and the editor of the present volume are grateful to alllibraries that kindly put books, photostats, microfilms, and bibliographical materialat their disposal.The Conseil international pour l'edition des oeuvres completes d'Erasme andthe Editorial Board mourn the sad loss of the founding father of the Erasmusedition, Dr. Cornelis Reedijk, who died on 7 May 2000 at the age of 79. Born inRotterdam, he attended the Gymnasium Erasmianum of that city. After readingclassics at Leiden and Amsterdam, he started working at the GemeentebibliotheekRotterdam in 1945, where he became Keeper in 1953, and Director in 1958.In the meantime he published his pioneering edition of The Poems ofDesideriusErasmus (Leiden, Brill, 1956). It served as his Leiden Ph.D. thesis, which wassupervised by Professor J.H. Waszink.In 1962 Reedijk was appointed Head Librarian of the Koninklijke Bibliotheekat The Hague, from which he retired in 1986. He also distinguished himself inmany international activities, in particular in the context of the InternationalFederation of Library Associations.The story ofhow the Conseil international and the Erasmus edition came intobeing is told in the General Introduction (see ASD I, I, pp. xv-xvii). There is noneed to repeat it here, but it may be appropriate to quote the opening passage:\u00abThe initiative for this edition was taken in Rotterdam, Erasmus' native city. In1960 the historical society 'Roterodamum' addressed a letter to the municipalitycontaining a number of suggestions for the commemoration of the fifth centenaryof Erasmus' birth in 1969. One of these suggestions was that the municipalityencourage an investigation of the question whether there was a need for a newcritical edition of the works of Erasmus and, if so, by what means such an editionmight be accomplished\u00bb.The man behind this initiative was Reedijk, who understated his role, beingthe actual author of the General introduction which was signed by the membersof the then Editorial Board, J.H. Waszink, Leon-E. Halkin, C. Reedijk, C.M.Bruehl. With Reedijk's death, they have all left us now.Dr. Reedijk became the Secretary of the Conseil international in 1963 and in1969 its Secretary General, combining this post from 1992 with that of Treasurer.For reasons of health he decided to resign these positions in 1998, remaining,however, a member of the Conseil international and the Editorial Board.Both the Conseil and the Board will remember Cornelis Reedijk with gratitudeand affection, and they will hold his memory in high esteem",

                "As all participants know by now, the Bialowieza Summer Workshop has acquired a life of its own. The charming venue of the meetings, the informal atmosphere, the enthusiasm of the participants and the intensity of the scientific interaction have all conspired to make these meetings wonderful learning experiences. The XIIth Workshop (held from July 1 - 7, 1993) was once again a topical meeting within the general area of Differential Geometric Methods in Physics, focusing specifically on Quantization and Infinite-dimensional Systems. Altogether, about fifty participants attended the workshop. As before, the aim of the workshop was to have a small number of in-depth lectures on the main theme and a somewhat larger number of short presentations on related areas, while leaving enough free time for private discussions and exchange of ideas. Topics treated in the workshop included field theory, geometric quantization and symplectic geometry, coherent states methods, holomorphic representation theory, Poisson structures, non-commutative geometry, supersymmetry and quantum groups. The editors have the pleasant task of first thanking all the local organizers, in particular Dr. K. Gilewicz, for their painstaking efforts in ensuring the smooth running of the meeting and for organizing a delightful array of social events. Secondly, they would like to record their indebtedness to all the people who have contributed to this volume and to the redoubtable Ms. Cindy Parkinson without whose patient typesetting and editing skills the volume could hardly have seen the light of the day."

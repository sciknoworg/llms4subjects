            "abstract": "This study provides new evidence on the local labor market impacts of trade, differentiating between the employment, income, migration, and informality channels. It uses a unique dataset matching information on exports and imports from customs with indicators on employment and labor incomes for around 2,000 Mexican municipalities over 2004-14. The analysis uses an instrumental variable approach that combines the initial structure of trade across municipalities with global trends in trade between low- and middle-income countries (excluding Mexico) and the United States by sector. First, the study finds that expanding exports per worker in Mexico's municipalities increased labor force participation but not employment rates. Exports also raised total labor incomes but not average labor incomes, implying a growing labor supply. The results also find that export and import expansion increased immigration and lowered the rate of informal workers. Second, the analysis examines differences by geography and sectors. It finds that trade affected labor markets in the North through the income and migration channels and in the South through the employment and informality channels. Exports benefitted the total incomes of workers in both the manufacturing and service sectors but reduced informality only in manufacturing. Third, the study suggests a more favorable role of intermediate relative to final imports, driven by manufacturing imports. It also finds evidence for positive spillovers from global value chain participation through the employment and income channels. Finally, it examines how local policy mediates the labor market effects from trade, focusing on connectivity, labor market flexibility, and education spending",

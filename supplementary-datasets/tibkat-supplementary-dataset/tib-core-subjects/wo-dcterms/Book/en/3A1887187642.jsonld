The combination of her professional experience as a practitioner in the financial services industry and her role as an advisor to regulators makes this textbook a must-read at all levels of both regulated and unregulated financial institutions.\" -Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Prouvost, Director, Operational Risk, The World Bank \"Insightful...That's the first adjective that came to mind when I read this book. Operational Risk Management: Best Practices in the Financial Services Industry offers a 360-degree perspective of operational risk, from triggers and causes to direct and indirect consequences. Besides, the book provides practical tips to set up an effective operational risk and control framework. There is not a single aspect of operational risk that is left in the shade - everything is brought to light - even the trickiest aspects such as Risk Appetite. This book is a must-read for any all-around OpRisk Manager!\" -Dr. Bertrand K. Hassani, Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne; Chief Solutions Officer, General Manager, INSTADEEP \"The collection of Dr. Chapelle's knowledge and practitioner expertise, combined with her widely acknowledge ability to communicate complex ideas in a forthright and clear manner, makes this textbook a very valuable addition to any practitioner seeking clear, accurate, timely and insightful knowledge of key aspects of Operational Risk practice. I strongly endorse this text to practitioners seeking guidance on best practices in operational management.\" -Prof. Gareth W. Peters, Chair Professor of Risk and Insurance, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK The Authoritative Guide to the Best Practices in Operational Risk Management Operational Risk Management offers the most current information available for putting in place an effective risk management program for a financial services firm. Comprehensive in scope, the book outlines the frameworks, tools and techniques that successful firms use to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor risk within their organisations. The different chapters present a holistic approach, which helps to clarify the relationship between the different components of a risk management framework and offers a consistent view of effective risk management. This flexible framework can be tailored to each firm based on its own practices, size and business complexity. Operational Risk Management offers the information risk managers need not only to help their organisations avoid crises, but also to safely recognise new opportunities, achieve their full potential, and reach new heights of success",

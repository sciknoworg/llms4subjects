            "abstract": "The pandemic produced changes in the organisation of the socioeconomic tissue. The educational system, in particular, underwent a forced reconsideration of classrooms\u2019 space and time. To preserve inclusivity and wellbeing and to compensate for the lack of body-cognitive experiences, our research team worked with the educational systems before and during the pandemic, providing educators with effective indexes concerning didactic practices. What emerged from our studies is the necessity to help students and teachers to cope with isolation, boredom, and bullying. The following document aims to report the multidisciplinary approaches developed by the international team from the University of Naples Parthenope (Italy) and the University of Derby (United Kingdom)",

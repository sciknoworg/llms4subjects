Advances in Manufacturing Technology: Computational Materials Processing and Characterization focuses on the design of experiment-based computational models, which involves finite element analysis along with an ergonomic-based design of tooling for both conventional and nonconventional manuscript processes. It discusses research work and recent developments in the field of production manufacturing of any mechanical system. Case studies and solved numerical solutions are included at the end of each chapter for easy reading comprehension. The book is helpful to those working on new developments in the field of product manufacturing. It also acts as a first-hand source of information for academic scholars and commercial manufacturers as they make strategic manufacturing development plans\"--",

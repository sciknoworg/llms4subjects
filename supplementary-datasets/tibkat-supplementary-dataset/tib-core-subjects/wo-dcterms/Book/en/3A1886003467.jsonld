The chapters look at the extraction technologies, analytical techniques, and potential health prospects specifically from fruits and vegetables sources. They cover plants such plantation crops, roots, and tubers, as well as fruit and vegetable processing byproducts. They also consider bioactive compounds and nutraceuticals from major and minor cereal grain sources and from cereal processing byproducts. This new book provides valuable insight for food technologists and those in related areas of research. Bioactive Compounds and Nutraceuticals from Plant Sources: Extraction Technology, Analytical Techniques, and Potential Health Prospects is the companion volume to Bioactive Compounds and Nutraceuticals from Dairy, Marine, and Nonconventional Sources: Extraction Technology, Analytical Techniques, and Potential Health Prospects by the same editors\"--",

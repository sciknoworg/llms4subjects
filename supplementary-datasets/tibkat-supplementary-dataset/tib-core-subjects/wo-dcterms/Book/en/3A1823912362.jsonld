            "title": "Lean construction 4.0 : driving a digital revolution of production management in the AEC industry",
            "abstract": "\"This book introduces and develops the novel concept of Lean Construction 4.0. The capability of Lean Construction to effectively adapt the architecture-engineering-construction (AEC) industry to this new era of digital transformation requires a reconceptualization of the triad people-processes-technology as a foundation for the theoretical and practical framework of Lean Construction. Therefore, a shift towards Lean Construction 4.0 is required. Lean Construction 4.0 is a new systems-wide thinking approach where synergies and overlaps between Lean Construction and digital/smart technologies go far beyond BIM to reshape the way we design, manage, and operate capital projects in the modern age of automation. This pioneering new book brings together the views of world experts at the interface of Lean Construction and digital/smart technologies, in order to channel research efforts, to introduce and discuss current research and practice, challenges and drivers, and future perspectives of Lean Construction 4.0. It is not the aim of the book to keep adding digits to the term 'Lean Construction' to 'catch up' with the industry revolutions as they go on. Instead, after reading this book, it will be undeniable for readers that the triad process-people-technology as proposed by Lean Construction 4.0 is required to achieve an effective, long-lasting digital transformation of the AEC industry. Thus, the aim of Lean Construction 4.0 is better explained by what it evokes: a future vision of construction systems comprising people, processes, and technology using Industry 4.0/5.0 as a basis for technological innovation in the AEC industry coupled with Lean Construction theory and practice as a jettison for improved processes and systems integration. The Lean Construction 4.0 concept coined and developed in this edited book is unique and the chapters provide practitioners and academics with a provocative reflection on the theoretical and practical aspects that shape the Lean Construction 4.0 concept. More importantly, Lean Construction 4.0 proposes a rationale for the AEC industry not only to survive, but to thrive!\"--",

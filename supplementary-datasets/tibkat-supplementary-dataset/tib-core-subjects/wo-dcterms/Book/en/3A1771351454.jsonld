It shows how IoT opens the door to a wealth of relevant healthcare information through real-time data analysis as well as testing, providing reliable and pragmatic data that yields enhanced solutions and discovery of previously undiscovered issues. The Role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in Biomedical Engineering: Present Scenario and Challenges discusses IoT devices that are deployed for enabling patient health tracking, various emergency issues, smart administration of patients, etc. It looks at the problems of cardiac analysis in e-healthcare, explores the employment of smart devices aimed for different patient issues, and examines the usage of Arduino kits where the data can be transferred to cloud for internet-based uses. The volume also considers the roles of IoT in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which play significant roles in biomedical applications. This book also incorporates the use of IoT applications for smart wheelchairs, telemedicine, GPS positioning of heart patients, smart administration with drug tracking, and more. Key features: Explores the use of IoT in the field of biomedical engineering Discusses current issues associated with biomedical engineering while including the fundamentals such as collaboration on usage of sensors, bio-interfaces, e-medicine, remote healthcare, etc. Throws light on IoT for healthcare monitoring as well as for remote healthcare, data communication, monitoring, and diagnosis. The book will help readers to keep abreast of the current novel technologies for conducting research while employing various diagnostic tools and to explore frontiers of what is realizable in practice\"--",

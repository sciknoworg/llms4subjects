            "abstract": "The concept of sustainable development refers to four distinct areas\u2014human, social, economic, and environmental\u2014known as the four pillars of sustainability. Cultural industries are a challenge for the future of culture. This field includes four main topics, namely features, domination, individualization, and the characterization of the culture industry itself. The purpose of cultural industries is important for ensuring the continued development of society and is at the heart of a creative economy for generating considerable economic wealth.Design and cultural creativity will eventually be implemented into specific designs. The complexity of the design itself requires careful consideration in all aspects and especially in the field of engineering. How can we make designs more in line with human nature? How can we implement the spirit and concept of sustainable development in the cultural industry? This all requires mutual cooperation between designers, engineers, and companies. Meanwhile, how to make consumers realize the necessity and urgency of sustainable development through cultural industries also needs to be considered. The articles in this Special Issue can be divided into four categories:- Study of Tourism in Relation to Sustainability.- Study of Cross-Culture Design in Relation to Sustainability.- Study of Heritage in Relation to Sustainability.- Study of Local Culture in Relation to Sustainability",

                "This Open Access book considers the cultural representation of gender violence, vulnerability and resistance with a focus on the transnational dimension of our contemporary visual and literary cultures in English. Contributors address concepts such as vulnerability, resilience, precarity and resistance in the Anglophone world through an analysis of memoirs, films, TV series, and crime and literary fiction across India, Ireland, Canada, Australia, the US, and the UK. Chapters explore literary and media displays of precarious conditions to examine whether these are exacerbated when intersecting with gender and ethnic identities, thus resulting in structural forms of vulnerability that generate and justify oppression, as well as forms of individual or collective resistance and/or resilience. Substantial insights are drawn from Animal Studies, Critical Race Studies, Human Rights Studies, Post-Humanism and Postcolonialism. This book will be of interest to scholars in Gender Studies, Media Studies, Sociology, Culture, Literature and History. Maria Isabel Romero-Ruiz is Lecturer in Social History and Cultural Studies at the University of M\u00e1laga, Spain. She specialises in the social and cultural history of deviant women and children in Victorian England, as well as in contemporary gender and sexual identity issues in Neo-Victorian fiction. Pilar Cuder-Dom\u00ednguez is Professor of English at the University of Huelva, Spain, where she teaches the literature and cultures of Great Britain and Anglophone Canada. Her research deals with the intersections of gender, genre, race, and nation.

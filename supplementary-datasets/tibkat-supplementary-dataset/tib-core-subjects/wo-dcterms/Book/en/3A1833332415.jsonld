            "abstract": "Reflects the extraordinary scope and topicality of Luk\u00e1cs and Frankfurt School thoughtBuilds on author's decades of research and previous publication on Luk\u00e1cs and Frankfurt School, including editing and translation of Hungarian language texts by Luk\u00e1cs, his Modernism and the Frankfurt School book, and numerous published essays and book chaptersBrings Luk\u00e1cs and key figures of the Frankfurt School in dialogue with other influential thinkers, for instance Luk\u00e1cs with Bloch and Marcuse, Adorno with Clement Greenberg and Bernard Stiegler, Benjamin/Adorno/Marcuse with Bataille/Blanchot/KlossowskiRepresents a unique selection and range of interdisciplinary and intermedial perspectives, from philosophy to literary, visual, and music studies to social and political theoryDraws upon sources in English, German, Hungarian, French, and Italian, expanding the understanding of key theorists beyond English-translated sourcesThis book examines the heritage of critical theory from the Hungarian Marxist philosopher Georg Luk\u00e1cs through the early Frankfurt School up to current issues of authoritarian politics and democratisation. Interweaving discussion of art and literature, utopian thought, and the dialectics of high art and mass culture, it offers unique perspectives on an interconnected group of left-wing intellectuals who sought to understand and resist their society's systemic impoverishment of thought and experience. Starting from Luk\u00e1cs's reflections on art, utopia, and historical action, it progresses to the Frankfurt School philosopher Theodor W. Adorno's analyses of music, media, avant-garde and kitsch. It concludes with discussions of erotic utopia, authoritarianism, postsocialism, and organised deceit in show trials - topics in which the legacy of Luk\u00e1cs and Frankfurt School critical theory continues to be relevant today",

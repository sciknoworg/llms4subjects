            "abstract": "\"Fully revised and updated for its third edition, this book presents the definitive compilation of current knowledge on all aspects of biochar. Research on biochar continues to accelerate as its importance for soil health, climate change mitigation and adaption and the circular economy becomes more widely acknowledged. This book not only reviews recent advances made in our understanding of biochar properties, behaviour and effects in agriculture, the environmental management, and material production, but specifically develops fundamental principles and frameworks of biochar science and application. This third edition has been fully revised and updated to reflect recent developments and growing trends, with important coverage of the application of biochar outside of its traditional soil-based uses, the commercialisation of biochar and its incorporation into policy. This includes brand new chapters on the role of biochar-based materials for environmental remediation, building construction and animal feed, and a greater discussion of biochar's role in the circular economy, climate change mitigation and sustainable development. Overall, this book provides a systematic, comprehensive and global examination of biochar. Written by an international team of academics and professionals it addresses its uses, production and management and its broader potential for mitigating climate change and driving forward sustainable development. Edited by two leading figures in the field, Biochar for Environmental Management is essential reading for students, scholars, practitioners and policymakers interested in biochar and the role it can play in environmental sustainability and global sustainable development\"--",

            "abstract": "In a world increasingly shaped by displacement and migration, refuge is both a coveted right and an elusive promise for millions. While conventionally understood as legal protection, it also transcends judicial definitions. In Lived Refuge, Vinh Nguyen reconceptualizes refuge as an ongoing affective experience and lived relation rather than a fixed category with legitimacy derived from the state. Focusing on Southeast Asian diasporas in the wake of the Vietnam War, Nguyen examines three affective experiences\u2014gratitude, resentment, and resilience\u2014to reveal the actively lived dimensions of refuge. Through multifaceted analyses of literary and cultural productions, Nguyen argues that the meaning of refuge emerges from how displaced people negotiate the kinds of safety and protection that are offered to (and withheld from) them. In so doing, he lays the framework for an original and compelling understanding of contemporary refugee subjectivity. \u201cLived Refuge allows us to see refugees in a new way. Vinh Nguyen\u2019s engagement with the experiments, negotiations, and refusals of refuge provides a unique window into understanding how refugee subjectivity is enacted today.\u201d \u2014 PETER NYERS, McMaster University \u201cIn haunting, lyrical prose with Walter Benjamin\u2019s urgency and Raymond Williams\u2019 political deftness, Nguyen\u2019s illuminating study marks a milestone in migration studies at large.\u201d \u2014 B. VENKAT MANI, author of Cosmopolitical Claims and Recoding World Literature \u201cNguyen offers a masterful, unrelenting rebuttal to state-sanctioned narratives of \u2018deserving\u2019 refugees. After reading Lived Refuge, you\u2019ll realize that we need refugees more than they need us.\u201d \u2014 ERIC TANG, author of Unsettled: Cambodian Refugees in the NYC Hyperghetto",

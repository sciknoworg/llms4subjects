                "The book covers an overview of fungal polymers, fungal mycelial biomass, and their applications besides providing a detailed account of various opportunities. This book also includes information on developments in mycotechnology related to fashion, furnishing, construction, packaging, mycelial-based bricks, construction binder, cementing materials, and so on. Other aspects include the value of chitin, chitosan, hydrophobins, lignocellulosic composites, oil recovery, biosurfactants and bioemulsifiers, nanofibers from pullulan, exopolymeric substances, bioresins, and biocomposites. Additional topics covered in the book include self-healing fungal concrete (which could help to build repairs) and recipe to inhibit fruit body formation, for living fungal biomaterial manufacture. There is no comprehensive book other than \u2013 some reviews, which addressed very brief historical developments and preliminary aspects of fungal biopolymers. Written by experts in their field from countries like Australia, India, USA, Germany, Turkey, Philippines, Oman, Belgium, Italy, Egypt, Brazil, and the United Kingdom, the chapters discuss at length applications of filamentous fungi in sustainable industrial pursuits and industrial developments with environmental safety. This book will be useful for students, teachers, researchers, and scientists in botany, microbiology, life sciences, biotechnology, agriculture and, industries that extensively use fungi for the production of value-added products. .",

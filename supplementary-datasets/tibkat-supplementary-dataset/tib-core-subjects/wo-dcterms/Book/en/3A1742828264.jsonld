            "abstract": "THE ONE-STOP RESOURCE FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ORGANIZATION CONSIDERING FOG COMPUTING Fog and Fogonomics is a comprehensive and technology-centric resource that highlights the system model, architectures, building blocks, and IEEE standards for fog computing platforms and solutions. The \"fog\" is defined as the multiple interconnected layers of computing along the continuum from cloud to endpoints such as user devices and things including racks or microcells in server closets, residential gateways, factory control systems, and more. The authors noted experts on the topic review business models and metrics that allow for the economic assessment of fog-based information communication technology (ICT) resources, especially mobile resources. The book contains a wide range of templates and formulas for calculating quality-of-service values. Comprehensive in scope, it covers topics including fog computing technologies and reference architecture, fog-related standards and markets, fog-enabled applications and services, fog economics (fogonomics), and strategy. This important resource: Offers a comprehensive text on fog computingDiscusses pricing, service level agreements, service delivery, and consumption of fog computingExamines how fog has the potential to change the information and communication technology industry in the next decadeDescribes how fog enables new business models, strategies, and competitive differentiation, as with ecosystems of connected and smart digital products and servicesIncludes case studies featuring integration of fog computing, communication, and networking systems Written for product and systems engineers and designers, as well as for faculty and students, Fog and Fogonomics is an essential book that explores the technological and economic issues associated with fog computing.",

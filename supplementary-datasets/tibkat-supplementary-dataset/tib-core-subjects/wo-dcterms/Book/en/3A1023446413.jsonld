                "'Entrepreneurship research is ever expanding, and it seems time to step back and reflect on where we are and where to go. This excellent volume brings in a well-grounded perspective on where the future for entrepreneurship research (and researchers) may lie, assembling contributions by some of the most creative thinkers in the entrepreneurship field. This is a timely book, valuable for all those with an interest in the future of the entrepreneurship field.'--Friederike Welter, Institut f\u00fcr Mittelstandsforschung Bonn (IfM Bonn), University of Siegen, Germany and JIBS, Sweden. 'The burgeoning of interest in entrepreneurship in society has been accompanied by an increase in the scientific base of the field. This Handbook, with contributions from world-class researchers, not only reflects this trend but also contributes to the field by pushing forward its intellectual and scientific roots. It groups the contributions into four perspectives and draws upon a broad disciplinary base. Alain Fayolle has edited a very stimulating work that should be read by all those seriously interested in entrepreneurship.'--Robert Blackburn, Kingston University, UK and Editor, International Small Business Journal. 'Alain Fayolle has brought together an impressive collection of contributions from many of the very best scholars in entrepreneurship. In bringing them together, this engaging book not only offers a very thoughtful reflection on past and present work in entrepreneurship but also insightful, new and fresh perspectives for its future study. This book is a must read for anyone who is serious about entrepreneurship, its research and the future of the field. An exciting, fresh and very timely addition - thank you.'--Sarah L. Jack, Lancaster University Management School (LUMS), UK. This indispensable Handbook offers a fresh look at entrepreneurship research, addressing what we already know, and what we still need to know, in the field. Over the course of 17 chapters, a collaboration of 24 highly regarded researchers, experts in their fields, provide an insightful new perspective on the future of the study of entrepreneurship. They show that there is a need to redesign research in the field - enacting entrepreneurship out of the box - and to consider the history of entrepreneurship whilst developing the future course for research. They also underline the importance of developing research at the crossroads of different fields and the need to explore new domains and/or revisit e ...",

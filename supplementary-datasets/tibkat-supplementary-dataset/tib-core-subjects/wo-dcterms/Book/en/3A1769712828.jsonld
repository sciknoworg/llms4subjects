            "abstract": "\u201cDr Korstanje and George\u2019s consistent contribution to a political sociology of hospitality is further developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in this book. By \u2018translating\u2019 this unfortunate conjunction into a series of research contexts entangled in recurring patterns of political violence, he skilfully explores the new conundrums of inhospitality. For anyone interested in studies of globalisation with an emphasis on unequal development and political violence, this is an excellent text to read.\u201d \u2013Rodanthi Tzanelli, School of Sociology and Social Policy, University of Leeds, UK \u201cThe concept of mobility is renewed here with those key concerns that underpin contemporary tourism studies, including pleasure, travel and the co-creation of experience. The question of who controls the type of knowledge that is created and circulated during global crises is examined in the light of post-colonialism. Overall, this text forms both an introduction to studies of western empire and a new synthesis of the colonial narrative and economic growth in the aftermath of COVID-19\u201d. \u2013Charlie Mansfield, University of Plymouth, UK This book argues that COVID-19 revives a much deeper climate of terror which was instilled by terrorism and the War on Terror originally declared by Bush\u00b4s administration in 2001. It discusses critically not only the consequences of COVID-19 on our daily lives but also \u201cthe end of hospitality\u201d, at least as we know it. Since COVID-19 started spreading across the globe, it affected not only the tourism industry but also grinded global trade to a halt. Governments adopted restrictive measures to stop the spread of the virus, including the closure of borders, and airspace, the introduction of strict lockdowns and social distancing, much of which led to large-scale cancellations of international and domestic flights. This book explores how global tourists, who were largely considered ambassadors of democratic and prosperous societies in the pre-pandemic days, have suddenly become undesired guests. Maximiliano E. Korstanje is Reader at the University of Palermo, Argentina and he currently serves as book series editor of Advances in Hospitality, Tourism and Service Sectors (IGI Global, US) and Tourism Security-Safety and Post Conflict Destinations (Emerald Group Publishing, UK).

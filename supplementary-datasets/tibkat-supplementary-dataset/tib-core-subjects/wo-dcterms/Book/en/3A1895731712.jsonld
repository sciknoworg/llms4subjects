            "abstract": "\"Bioprocessing in Food Science\" is a series of volumes covering the entirety of unit operations in food processing. This latest volume covers nonthermal food engineering operations, focusing on packaging techniques, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies and their use and relevance within food engineering, fluid extraction, nanotechnology, and many other topics. As the demand for healthy food is increasing in the current global scenario, manufacturers are searching for new possibilities for occupying a greater share in the rapidly changing food market. Compiled reports and updated knowledge on thermal processing of food products are imperative for commercial enterprises and manufacturing units. In the current scenario, academia, researchers, and food industries are working in a scattered manner and different technologies developed at each level are not compiled to implement for the benefits of different stakeholders. However, advancements in bioprocesses are required at all levels for the betterment of food industries and consumers. This series of groundbreaking edited volumes will be a comprehensive compilation of all the research that has been carried out so far, their practical applications, and the future scope of research and development in the food bioprocessing industry. During the last decade, there have been major developments in novel technologies for food processing. This series will cover all the novel technologies employed for processing different types of foods, encompassing the background, principles, classification, applications, equipment, effect on foods, legislative issue, technology implementation, constraints, and food and human safety concerns",

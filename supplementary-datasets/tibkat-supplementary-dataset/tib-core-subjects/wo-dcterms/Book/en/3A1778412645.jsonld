            "title": "Transnational Narratives of Migration and Exile : Perspectives from the Humanities",
            "abstract": "This edited volume presents new perspectives on transnational narratives, through readings and analyses of films, novels, performance art, visual art and archival objects.  In recent years, issues of migration and exile have increasingly come to public attention. Experiences of exile and migration are also increasingly being documented and represented in the form of literary and aesthetic expressions, such as texts, films, and visual art projects like installations and photographs. Such representations are interesting aesthetic documents in their own right, and they also offer an important intake to the understanding of the transnational experience of migration and exile. These stories, or transnational narratives, favor a more nuanced perspective as well as new imaginaries of migration and exile that allow for the interrogation of contemporary discourses on these topics. The contributions to this volume examine the complexity of transnational narratives through analyses of language, aesthetics and subjectivity, as well as of the critical potential and ethical dimension of these narratives. The volume is interdisciplinary, featuring contributions from literary studies, linguistics, art history, semiotics and film studies",

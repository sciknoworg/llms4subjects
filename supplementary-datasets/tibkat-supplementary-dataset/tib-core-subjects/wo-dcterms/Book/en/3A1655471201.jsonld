                "This volume contains a selection of papers by the participants of the 6. International Conference on Probability in Banach Spaces, Sand\u00ad bjerg, Denmark, June 16-D1, 1986. The conference was attended by 45 participants from several countries. One thing makes this conference completely different from the previous five ones, namely that it was ar\u00ad ranged jointly in Probability in Banach spaces and Banach space theory with almost equal representation of scientists in the two fields. Though these fields are closely related it seems that direct collaboration between researchers in the two groups has been seldom. It is our feeling that the conference, where the participants were together for five days taking part in lectures and intense discussions of mutual problems, has contributed to a better understanding and closer collaboration in the two fields. The papers in the present volume do not cover all the material pre\u00ad sented in the lectures; several results covered have been published else\u00ad where. The sponsors of the conference are: The Carlsberg Foundation, The Danish Natural Science Research Council, The Danish Department of Education, The Department of Mathematics, Odense University, The Department of Mathematics, Aarhus University, The Knudsen Foundation, Odense, Odense University, The Research Foundation of Aarhus University, The Thborg Foundation. The participants and the organizers would like to thank these institu\u00ad tions for their support. The Organizers. Contents A. de Acosta and M. Ledoux, On the identification of the limits in the law of the iterated logarithm in Banach spaces. . . . ."

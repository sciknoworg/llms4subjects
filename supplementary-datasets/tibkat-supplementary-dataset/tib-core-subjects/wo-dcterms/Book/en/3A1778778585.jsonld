Divided into three sections the book covers:              framing the subject - defining subject knowledge and focusing on questions about science as a school subject      teaching the subject - looking at pedagogical, curricular and pupil knowledge      science within the professional community - focusing on the place of science within the wider curriculum and the teaching community.        This refreshing new book provides stimulating assistance to subject specialists, from new teachers of science in the early years of professional development to those on a PGCE course or in their induction year. It is also suitable for subject leaders with mentor responsibilities and Advanced Skills Teachers undertaking specialist inset and teaching support",

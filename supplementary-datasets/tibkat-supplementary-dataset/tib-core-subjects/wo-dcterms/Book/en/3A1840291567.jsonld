                "This open access book compiles a series of chapters written by internationally recognized experts known for their in-depth but critical views on questions of resilience and food security. The book assesses rigorously and critically the contribution of the concept of resilience in advancing our understanding and ability to design and implement development interventions in relation to food security and humanitarian crises. For this, the book departs from the narrow beaten tracks of agriculture and trade, which have influenced the mainstream debate on food security for nearly 60 years, and adopts instead a wider, more holistic perspective, framed around food systems. The foundation for this new approach is the recognition that in the current post-globalization era, the food and nutritional security of the world\u2019s population no longer depends just on the performance of agriculture and policies on trade, but rather on the capacity of the entire (food) system to produce, process, transport and distribute safe, affordable and nutritious food for all, in ways that remain environmentally sustainable. In that context, adopting a food system perspective provides a more appropriate frame as it incites to broaden the conventional thinking and to acknowledge the systemic nature of the different processes and actors involved. This book is written for a large audience, from academics to policymakers, students to practitioners. Christophe B\u00e9n\u00e9 is Senior Researcher at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT. He has 20+ years of experience conducting interdisciplinary research and advisory work, focusing on poverty alleviation, food security, and more generally low-income countries\u2019 economic development. Stephen Devereux is a Research Fellow of the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex since 1996, working on famine, food security and social protection, with a focus on Africa. Since 2016 he has held a South Africa-UK Bilateral Research Chair in Social Protection for Food Security, affiliated to the DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence in Food Security and the University of the Western Cape in South Africa.",

            "abstract": "This book, Condensed Matter and Material Physics, incorporates the work of multiple authors to enhance the theoretical as well as experimental knowledge of materials. The investigation of crystalline solids is a growing need in the electronics industry. Micro and nano transistors require an in-depth understanding of semiconductors of different groups. Amorphous materials, on the other hand, as non-equilibrium materials are widely applied in sensors and other medical and industrial applications. Superconducting magnets, composite materials, lasers, and many more applications are integral parts of our daily lives. Superfluids, liquid crystals, and polymers are undergoing active research throughout the world. Hence profound information on the nature and application of various materials is in demand. This book bestows on the reader a deep knowledge of physics behind the concepts, perspectives, characteristic properties, and prospects. The book was constructed using 10 contributions from experts in diversified fields of condensed matter and material physics and its technology from over 15 research institutes across the globe",

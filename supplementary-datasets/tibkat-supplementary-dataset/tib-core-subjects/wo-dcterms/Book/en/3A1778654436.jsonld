            "abstract": "Dangerous Ideas explores sex and love, politics and performance, joy and anguish in a collection of essays focussed on the history and politics of the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement and one of its offshoots, Women\u2019s Studies, in Australia and around the world. These are serious matters: they are about tectonic changes in people\u2019s lives and ideas in the late twentieth century, too little remembered or understood any longer. \u2018Feminism\u2019, this book suggests, \u2018is always multiple and various, fluid and changing, defying efforts at definition, characterisation, periodisation\u2019. Nevertheless, Dangerous Ideas tackles some hard questions. How did Women\u2019s Liberation begin? What held this transformative movement together? Would it bring about the death of the family? Was it reorganising the labour market? Revolutionising human reproduction? How could Women\u2019s Studies exist in patriarchal universities? Could feminism change the paradigms governing the world of learning? In the United States? In Russia? In the People\u2019s Republic of China? It is great fun, too. This book tells of Hobart\u2019s hilarious Feminist Food Guide; of an outburst of creative energies among feminists \u2013 women on top, behaving badly; of dreams and desires for an entirely different future. And, always unorthodox: it finds hope and cheer in a history of the tampon",

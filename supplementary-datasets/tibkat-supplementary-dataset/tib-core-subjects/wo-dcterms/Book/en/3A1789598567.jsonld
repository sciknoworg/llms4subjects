                "\u201cA stunningly comprehensive yet detailed volume that demonstrates the importance of CDS for understanding disaster vulnerability, recovery, and resilience. Essential reading for scholars, students, and practitioners, with implications far beyond the Christchurch case\u201d. - Kathleen Tierney, Professor Emerita of Sociology, University of Colorado Boulder, USA \u201cThis is a rich resource for disaster researchers everywhere. The CDS perspective, which underpins this book, offers not just an evidence base from a decade of disaster experience but also a potential springboard for social change\u201d. - Maureen Fordham, Professor of Gender and Disaster Resilience, University College London, UK. \u201cBy bringing an impressive and diverse range of scholars together, the book articulates the social, political, historical, environmental, and intersectional considerations to forward \u014ctautahi Christchurch as a \u2018laboratory for the world\u2019 that informs disaster futures and a call to action\u201d. - Jay Marlowe, Associate Professor of Social Work, University of Auckland, New Zealand \u201cThese critical approaches enable a much deeper understanding of the 2010-2011 earthquakes as well as the different experiences, social responses and long-term impacts of waves of disasters in Christchurch.\u201d - Daniel Lorenz, Research Associate, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany This book critically surveys a decade of disasters in \u014ctautahi Christchurch. It brings together a diverse range of authors, disciplinary approaches and topics, to reckon with the events that commenced with the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence. Each contribution tackles its subject matter through the frame of Critical Disaster Studies (CDS). The events and the subsequent recovery provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn from a series of concatenating urban disasters in order to prepare us for our future on an urban planet facing unprecedented environmental pressures. The book focuses on the production of vulnerability, the human dimensions of disaster, the Indigenous response to disasters and the practical lessons that can be drawn from them. Shinya Uekusa is a Research Officer at Massey University. Steve Matthewman is an Associate Professor in Sociology at the University of Auckland. Bruce C. Glavovic is a Professor at Massey University."

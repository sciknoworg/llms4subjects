            "abstract": "Examines how Trump\u2019s election as President signals a rollback of the Obama yearsEstablishes what can be regarded as Obama's legacy, in both domestic and foreign policy Investigates how far the Trump administration (up to the end of 2019) undoes Obama's legacyFocuses on meaningful shifts in presidential priorities, policy changes, and the imprint of presidential leadershipCase studies on specific policy areas where presidential \u2018undoing\u2019 has had a significant impact or has been thwarted, such as healthcare reform and immigration policyIn 2008, in what seemed a seminal moment for the country\u2019s politics, the United States elected an African American as President. Yet, eight years later, the nation put Donald Trump \u2013 the very antithesis of his predecessor \u2013 in office. This book determines what can legitimately be regarded as the legacy of the Obama presidency and investigates how far the Trump administration has reversed it. The analysis is embedded in a historical context, based on examination and scrutiny of how, and how successfully, presidents in the modern era have overturned the work of their predecessor when they have attempted to do so. The authors focus on meaningful priority shifts, policy changes and the imprint of presidential leadership, providing a framework for assessing Obama\u2019s legacy, which in turn affords context to a discussion of the Trump administration\u2019s capacity to fulfil its promise to reverse the direction taken by the Obama White House. Looking beyond the noise and hyperbole, the book examines how robust the Obama legacy has proved to be in the face of Trump\u2019s challenge",

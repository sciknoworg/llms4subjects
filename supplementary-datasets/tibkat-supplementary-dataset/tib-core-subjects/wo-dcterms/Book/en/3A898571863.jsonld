            "abstract": "Founded in 1941, SLCE has continued to set new standards for producing buildings that inform and enhance urban environments worldwide. This book delves into the story of this progression across 75 years, highlighting SLCE's outstanding contribution to the New York and tri-state area in architectural design and property development as well as the logistics surrounding construction.00With demonstrated mastery across residential, mixed-use and commercial developments, as well as healthcare facilities, restoration and affordable housing, SLCE understands the full spectrum of urban life and consistently delivers buildings that answer to the city's complex needs. While seeing each project through to successful, timely completion, the firm has also pioneered more efficient, user-friendly amendments to New York planning law, zoning issues and air rights.00In a comprehensive essay following an introduction by the practice leaders, curator and writer Thomas Mellins contextualises SLCE's pivotal role in developing some of New York's most distinguished buildings in collaboration with internationally renowned practices, including the Blue Tower with Bernard Tschumi, the Bloomberg Tower with Cesar Pelli, VIA 57 West with BIG, 520 Park Avenue with Robert AM Stern and the University Center at The New School with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, as well as full-service projects including the German Mission to the United Nations, Gotham West, the POD Hotel and ELEMENT",

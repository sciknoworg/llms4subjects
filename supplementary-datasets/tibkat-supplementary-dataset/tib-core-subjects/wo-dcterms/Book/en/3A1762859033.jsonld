            "abstract": "Travel is widely acknowledged as an activity that increases individuals' levels of well-being. Nevertheless, the relationship between happiness and tourism is still a matter of investigation. Despite the overall beneficial effects of travel on happiness levels, tourism is not an activity with solely positive implications on peoples' lives. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how happiness manifests through tourism and how it can be expanded to different tourism actors, such as tourists, workers, and communities. The search for ways and methods to enhance the levels of happiness and well-being has grown significantly in recent years. Happiness and quality of life are timely issues and have become even more relevant due to the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.Rebuilding and Restructuring the Tourism Industry: Infusion of Happiness and Quality of Life is a critical references source that examines the fundamental relationship between tourism, happiness, and quality of life. This book discusses relevant theoretical frameworks and the latest findings from empirical research in happiness, well-being, and quality-of-life-related tourism. Focusing on topics such as neurotourism, PERMA theory, the economics of happiness, tourism employment opportunity, and overtourism, this book will intrigue scholars working in hospitality, tourism, destination management, economics, marketing, sociology, anthropology, and health sciences as well as managers, travel agencies, restaurateurs, hotel managers, and professionals who want to improve their understanding of the relationship between tourism and happiness, providing them with tools to develop better and sustainable practices for the sector",

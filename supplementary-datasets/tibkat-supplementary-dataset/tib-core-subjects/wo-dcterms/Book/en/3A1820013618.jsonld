                "This book showcases how the latest and most advanced types of analytical modeling and empirical analysis can help to create value in the global supply chain. Focusing on practical relevance, it shares valuable management insights and addresses key issues in operations management (OM), demonstrating how past research has led to various practices and impacts, while also exploring the aspirations of the latest research. It presents current research on various topics such as global supply chain design, service supply chains, product design, responsible supply chains, performance and incentives in operations, data analytics in health services, new business models in the digital age, and new digital technology advances such as blockchain. In addition, it presents practical case studies on the aforementioned topics. Beyond the value of its contents, the book is intended as a tribute to Professor Morris Cohen, who has been a major contributor to advancing the research frontier in operations management and a driving force in shaping the field. Given its scope, the book will appeal to a wide readership, from researchers and PhD students to practitioners and consultants."

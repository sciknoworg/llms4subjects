            "abstract": "The world faces a triple crisis of three interconnected issues-development, climate, and nature- and current levels of climate action are insufficient. Beyond the grim headlines, there are increasingly clear opportunities to achieve triple wins. To support the alignment of sustainable development priorities and actions with climate change risks and objectives, the World Bank launched the Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) in 2022. This core diagnostic tool aims to help countries prioritize the most impactful actions to boost resilience and adaptation and reduce GHG emissions, while delivering on broader development and sustainability objectives. CCDRs now cover 56 percent of the population of low- and middle-income countries (LICs and MICs) and 73 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP). The second set of CCDRs also includes one high-income country (HIC), Romania. A main addition of the CCDRs published since COP27 relates to tropical forests, a key dimension of the global climate change challenge. The first set of CCDRs covered only 10 percent of the world's tropical forests, but the addition of key forested countries-including Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, and the Republic of Congo-increases coverage to 56 percent. Many CCDRs (including Romania and Turkiye) also discuss the role of non-tropical forests for resilience and emission reduction. This second summary report builds on the first report published ahead of COP27. Although it is important to caveat the differences in scenarios and ambition, modeling framework, and scope of analysis, this report provides aggregated results that can help governments, private sector investors, citizens, and development partners prioritize the most impactful climate actions. It confirms-with more granularity and stronger evidence, based on more countries-key findings from the first summary report; but it also discusses new issues, such as deforestation and land degradation. It aims to inform global priorities, including the World Bank's Evolution Roadmap and Global Challenge Programs (GCP), as well as other global initiatives",

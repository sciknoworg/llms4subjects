            "abstract": "\"With the demands of increased system functionalities and performance, the system power density of microelectronics equipment is continuously increased at a fast pace. This is especially true for the telecommunications systems because the network traffic in the industry has grown very rapidly every year. For the high power air cooled systems, large high performance fans are becoming a must for the systems in order to provide the necessary air flow rates. Two major concerns about these large fans are the power consumption and the acoustic noise of the fans. In addition, the increase in the system power results in a significant increase in the operation cost of the equipment as well as its host facilities such as the date centers. Liquid cooling can not only resolve the above mentioned issues related to high power air-cooled systems but also enhance its system performance and reliability. For some cases, the system power is too high to be cooled by air thermally. The only solution to such situations is adopting the liquid cooling\"--",

            "abstract": "The overarching goal of this book is to provide a current picture of the latest developments in the capabilities of biomedical photoacoustic imaging and sensing in an affordable setting, such as advances in the technology involving light sources, and delivery, acoustic detection, and image reconstruction and processing algorithms. This book includes 14 chapters from globally prominent researchers , covering a comprehensive spectrum of photoacoustic imaging topics from technology developments and novel imaging methods to preclinical and clinical studies, predominantly in a cost-effective setting. Affordability is undoubtedly an important factor to be considered in the following years to help translate photoacoustic imaging to clinics around the globe. This first-ever book focused on biomedical photoacoustic imaging and sensing using affordable resources is thus timely, especially considering the fact that this technique is facing an exciting transition from benchtop to bedside. Given its scope, the book will appeal to scientists and engineers in academia and industry, as well as medical experts interested in the clinical applications of photoacoustic imaging",

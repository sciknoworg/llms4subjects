Robert Kowalskihas started using Node.js when version 0.4 was still new and has spent time working on the npm core team, which is where he learned a lot about good command line interfaces. As a developer he has also had to user other command line tools and it was this that made him realize how much a book like this was needed. In the past he has worked for big companies such as IBM and startups including Jimdo and Bitfinex, all in different roles, as well as committing to Node.js and Apache CouchDB. He speaks at conferences and has enjoyed writing since he was a child. You can find Robert on Twitter @robinson_k."

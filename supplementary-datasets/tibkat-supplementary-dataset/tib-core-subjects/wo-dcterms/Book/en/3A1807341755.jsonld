                "This book explores the transformation of the political organization of the world as manifest in different spheres of world politics, in particular, in world politics, regional studies, interaction of MNCs and government agencies, and state responses to biogenic challenges. To achieve this goal, M. Lebedeva proposes the concept of a political organization of the world, which in modern conditions is in the process of transformation. The transformation of the political organization of the world is accompanied by megatrends (globalization, integration, democratization) and the opposite trends (de-globalization disintegration, dedemocratization). Interdisciplinary in nature, this book brings together scholars from Russia, the United States, and Canada, and provides a compelling perspective on the geopolitics of our time. Marina Lebedeva graduated from the Moscow State University, 1977, received her PhD in 1981 and became Doctor of Political Science in 1993. She is the head of the World Politics Department, Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO-University). Marina Lebedeva is author and co-author of more than 400 academic publications, including books. Vladimir Morozov is Associate professor at the Department of Diplomacy and holds the position of Vice-President for HR. He has a PhD in History and has been working at MGIMO since 2002 with a short break in 2004\u20132007 when he was assigned to the Embassy of the Russian Federation to Israel.",

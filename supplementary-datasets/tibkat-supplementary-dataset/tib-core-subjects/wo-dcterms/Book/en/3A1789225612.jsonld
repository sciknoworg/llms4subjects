            "abstract": "This full-colour book will inspire you to start solving problems and creating programs with Python, even if you have absolutely no  programming experience. It s not just friendly and easy: it s the first Python beginner s guide that puts you in control of your  own learning, and empowers you to build unique programs to solve problems you care about. Microsoft has completely reinvented the beginning programmer s tutorial, reflecting deep research into how today s beginners learn,  and why other books fall short. Begin to Code with Python is packed with innovations, including its \u201cSnaps\u201d library of pre-built  operations that are easy to combine your own unique programs, Cookie Cutter templates that give you a flying start, and \u201cMake Something  Happen\u201d projects that help you build skills by creating your own programs, not programs someone else has handed you. Throughout, Begin to Code with Python balances playful exposition and illustration of programming fundamentals with  your own creative input - and you ll never be more than a page or two away from making something unique and personal to you. It will  help you    Understand the basics of coding, from simple data storage to more complex and useful programs Discover how Python works using the Visual Studio environment Master advanced techniques, including classes and object-based solutions design Extend your code with Python s powerful libraries Build web and cloud-based applications, as well as graphical user interfaces and games Test and debug your code with  What can go wrong  sections Understand the social aspects of professional development, and build career-ready skills from the start",

            "abstract": "\"Elastic Wave Propagation in Structures and Materials initiates with a brief introduction to wave propagation, different wave equations, integral transforms including fundamentals of Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform, Laplace Transform and their numerical implementation. Concept of spectral analysis and procedure to compute the wave parameters, wave propagation in 1-D isotropic waveguides, wave dispersion in 2-D waveguides is explained. Wave propagation in different media such as laminated composites, functionally graded structures, granular soils including non-local elasticity models is addressed. The entire book is written in modular form and analysis is performed in frequency domain. Features: Brings out idea of wave dispersion and its utility in the dynamic responses. Introduces concepts as Negative Group Speeds, Einstein's Causality and escape frequencies using solid mathematical framework. Discusses the propagation of waves in materials such as laminated composites and functionally graded materials. Proposes spectral finite element as analysis tool for wave propagation. Each concept/chapter supported by homework problems and MATLAB/FORTRAN codes. This book aims at Senior Undergraduates and Advanced Graduates in all streams of engineering especially Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering\"--",

            "abstract": "Today, modern Geotechnical Engineers, who in the past would have considered the phenomena occurring in the (primarily soil) environment, are faced with developments in environmental sciences that are becoming increasingly more detailed and sophisticated, with the natural phenomena and processes surrounding the civil engineering infrastructure being modeled, designed, monitored, and assessed in a more holistic way. This book brings together the state of the art in geotechnics with a focus on sustainable design, resilience, construction, and monitoring of the performance of geotechnical assets from ground investigations, through foundation and drainage design to soil stabilization and reinforcement. Engineers and scientists working in the fields of green infrastructure, nature-based solutions, sustainable drainage, eco-engineering, hydro-geology, landscape planning, plant science, environmental biology or bio-chemistry, earth sciences, GIS, and remote sensing are represented here by articles that show significant geotechnical components or applications. Case studies showcasing the application of the sustainable development principles (e.g., reuse, recycle, reduce; stakeholder engagement; public health; UN Global Sustainability Goals) in Geotechnics are also included in this book",

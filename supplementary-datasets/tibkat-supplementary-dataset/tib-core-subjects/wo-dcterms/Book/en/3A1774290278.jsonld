            "abstract": "The Service Delivery Indicators (SDIs) provides a set of key indicators serving as a benchmark for service delivery performance in the health and education sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa. The overarching objective of the SDIs is to ascertain the quality of service delivery in primary education and basic health services. This would in turn enable governments and service providers alike to identify gaps and bottlenecks, as well as track progress over time, and across countries. The SDI survey interviewed 403 heath providers across Tanzania between May 2014 and July 2014. This technical report presents the findings from the implementation of the SDI in the health sector in Tanzania in 2014. Survey implementation activities took place following extensive consultations with the government and key stakeholders on survey design, sampling, and adaptation of survey instruments. A major challenge for Tanzania's health sector is the shortage of skilled human resources for health (HRH). This survey found that provider knowledge and abilities were not adequate to deliver quality services. Caseload per provider and absenteeism are relatively low, so the issue is not over burdened providers. There seems to be ample room for a significant increase in the caseload of Tanzanian providers, id est the level of productivity in health service delivery, without jeopardizing quality. In addition to increasing the volume of skilled HRH to address the shortage of providers, improvements in management, supervision and training is important to improving service delivery. Health for all in Tanzania will mean the simultaneous availability of widely accessible inputs and skilled providers",

                "This book fills a clear gap in the literature for a technically-focused book covering nuclear proliferation and related issues post-9/11. Using a concept-led approach which serves a broad readership, it provides detailed overview of nuclear weapons, nuclear proliferation and international nuclear policy. The author addresses topics including offensive and defensive missile systems, command and control, verification, weapon effects, and nuclear testing. A chronology of nuclear arms is presented including detailed discussion of the Cold War, proliferation, and arms control treaties. The book is tailored to courses on nuclear proliferation, and the general reader will also find it a fascinating introduction to the science and strategy behind international nuclear policy in the modern era. \u201cFinally, a spritely, accessible overview of the nuclear world in historical context from someone who has both seen it from the U.S. State Department and Congressional policy trenches and taught it for 43 years. A gift to both concerned citizens and interested students.\u201d Frank von Hippel, Prof. Public and International Affairs (emeritus), Princeton University \u201cThe threat of nuclear weapons has been with the world community for a long time. Global destruction was narrowly avoided three or four times or more during the Cold War with the use of such weapons remaining an immediate threat in some parts of the world\u2026 David Hafemeister's outstanding new book provides the reader this essential review of the threat, taking into account its many manifestations in a careful and thorough way. It should not be missed.\u201d Thomas Graham, Jr., former Special Representative of the President for Arms Control and Non-proliferation \u201cHafemeister's Nuclear Proliferation and Terrorism contains a wealth of information about nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The reader \u2013 whether professionally involved with these weapons or a citizen seeking to become better informed \u2013 will come away with a sober appreciation of the dangers, and with increased insight into how the world seeks to eliminate them.\u201d Pierce Corden, former Admin. Exec. Officer, Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Commission \u201cFor more than 70 years since August 9, 1945, nuclear weapons have not been detonated in war, and terrorists have yet to acquire these weapons. Will humanity be so fortunate for the next 70 years? To learn what can and should be done to further reduce the risks of these and other dangers, read David Hafemeister\u2019s excellent book.\u201d Charles D. Ferguson, President, Federation of American Scientists.",

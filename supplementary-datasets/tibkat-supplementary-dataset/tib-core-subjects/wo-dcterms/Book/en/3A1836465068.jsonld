            "abstract": "This essay proposes a preliminary catalogue of fifteen suggested saj\u02bf structures, with representative Qur\u2019anic examples. The basic rules that govern Qur\u2019anic saj\u02bf have already been carefully elucidated by Devin Stewart in a series of articles on this subject. Stewart has also provided some exploratory illustrations of where individual saj\u02bfahs might combine to form consecutive strings of saj\u02bf units. Yet the statement of the medieval rhetorician \u1e0ciy\u0101\u02be al-D\u012bn ibn al-Ath\u012br (d. 637/1239) that it is only the occasional need for \u201cbrevity\u201d (\u012bj\u0101z) and \u201cconcision\u201d (ikhti\u1e63\u0101r) that precluded the Qur\u2019an from having been written entirely in saj\u02bf suggests that, at some point, many more of the Qur\u2019an\u2019s rhetorical features must have been seen as having being informed by the rules and the rhythms of saj\u02bf than the current perception of Qur\u2019anic saj\u02bf in the Western Academy might lead one to imagine.  The idea that Qur\u2019anic saj\u02bf might in fact operate within a deliberate give and take of saj\u02bf\u2019s three distinct parameters\u2014end rhyme, accentual beat patterning, and grammatical parallelism\u2014proved to be a fruitful one in categorizing a number of the passages highlighted by Ibn al-Ath\u012br as illustrative of the phenomenon of saj\u02bf in the Qur\u2019an. Using this methodology it was possible to create a number of strings of consecutive saj\u02bfahs that would otherwise have fallen outside of the parameters of saj\u02bf as it is currently understood",

            "abstract": "Through 19 contributions, this collective volume considers some aspects of the representation and re-elaboration of Antiquity in literature for children and young adults, especially in novels, comics and manga. Mythology receives a great deal of attention, but history, especially Roman history, is also addressed, for example through series like Asterix, Alix or Thermae Romae. Four issues are emphasized: the nature and extent of the adaptations made, the way they were made, the intention in which they were carried out, the content of the message delivered. It is thus shown how Antiquity, in various forms, can be used in the publications and corpora studied as a vector for teaching, for education, for cultural mediation or simply for recreation, and how it allows for various forms of personal reappropriation by the readers",

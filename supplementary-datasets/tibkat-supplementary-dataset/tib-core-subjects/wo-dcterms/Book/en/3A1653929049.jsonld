                "This book is open access under a CC BY 4.0 license. This edited volume is concerned with the evolution and achievements of cooperation in research and innovation between Africa and Europe, and points to the need for more diversified funding and finance mechanisms, and for novel models of collaboration to attract new actors and innovative ideas. It reflects on the political, economic, diplomatic and scientific rationale for cooperation, while also examining practical developments, illustrated with examples, in the fields of food security, health, and climate change. The need to mobilise scientific knowledge and to ensure equality and fairness in the cooperation are recurrent themes. Africa-Europe Cooperation in Research and Innovation is essential reading for policy makers and researchers in international relations and science diplomacy. Andrew Cherry is Senior Scientific Officer at the Association of Commonwealth Universities. He currently manages projects on fostering international collaboration in research and innovation, and has coordinated both the CAAST-Net and CAAST-Net Plus projects since 2008.

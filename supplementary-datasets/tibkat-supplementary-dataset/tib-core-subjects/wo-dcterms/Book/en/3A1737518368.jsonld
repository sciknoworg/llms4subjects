                "This book presents English translations of Michele Sce\u2019s most important works, originally written in Italian during the period 1955-1973, on hypercomplex analysis and algebras of hypercomplex numbers. Despite their importance, these works are not very well known in the mathematics community because of the language they were published in. Possibly the most remarkable instance is the so-called Fueter-Sce mapping theorem, which is a cornerstone of modern hypercomplex analysis, and is not yet understood in its full generality. This volume is dedicated to revealing and describing the framework Sce worked in, at an exciting time when the various generalizations of complex analysis in one variable were still in their infancy. In addition to faithfully translating Sce\u2019s papers, the authors discuss their significance and explain their connections to contemporary research in hypercomplex analysis. They also discuss many concrete examples that can serve as a basis for further research. The vast majority of the results presented here will be new to readers, allowing them to finally access the original sources with the benefit of comments from fellow mathematicians active in the field of hypercomplex analysis. As such, the book offers not only an important chapter in the history of hypercomplex analysis, but also a roadmap for further exciting research in the field."

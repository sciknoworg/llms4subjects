            "abstract": "A large proportion of artists considered in this study at some stage of their career veered towards \u2018serious\u2019 or experimental music. This also refers to Peter Rehberg and Christian Fennesz. However, they differ from those considered previously, because unlike them, they did not cross the boundary between the popular and academic now and then but made it their personal signature. Their music also challenges our concept of electronic music, as well as studio and stage and even music and non-music. To contextualise their work, it is worth locating it first against the concept of \u2018noise music\u2019 or rather \u2018noise as music\u2019",

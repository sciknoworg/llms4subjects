            "abstract": "This open access book shares revealing insights into the development of mathematics education research in Germany from 1976 (ICME 3 in Karlsruhe) to 2016 (ICME 13 in Hamburg). How did mathematics education research evolve in the course of these four decades? Which ideas and people were most influential, and how did German research interact with the international community? These questions are answered by scholars from a range of fields and in ten thematic sections: (1) a short survey of the development of educational research on mathematics in German speaking countries (2) subject-matter didactics, (3) design science and design research, (4) modelling, (5) mathematics and Bildung 1810 to 1850, (6) Allgemeinbildung, Mathematical Literacy, and Competence Orientation (7) theory traditions, (8) classroom studies, (9) educational research and (10) large-scale studies. During the time span presented here, profound changes took place in German-speaking mathematics education research. Besides the traditional fields of activity like subject-matter didactics or design science, completely new areas also emerged, which are characterized by various empirical approaches and a closer connection to psychology, sociology, epistemology and general education research. Each chapter presents a respective area of mathematics education in Germany and analyzes its relevance for the development of the research community, not only with regard to research findings and methods but also in terms of interaction with the educational system. One of the central aspects in all chapters concerns the constant efforts to find common ground between mathematics and education. In addition, readers can benefit from this analysis by comparing the development shown here with the mathematical education research situation in their own country",

            "abstract": "\"Nowadays, biomass presents itself as a very viable alternative for the production of energy, both electrical and thermal, quickly recovering its role, both in the universe of domestic and industrial use. With growing concerns about climate change, it is becoming increasingly urgent to use environmentally harmful forms of energy production that contribute to the decarbonization of the economy. Biomass is capable of making a significant contribution to achieving this overall objective, since its use proves to be neutral from the point of view of the emission of carbon dioxide. However, the simple production of energy from biomass presents and encompasses a large number of variables, which justify its study for a better understanding. The aim that the editors intend to achieve with this book is to take an inclusive approach to all components that cover the use of biomass for energy production. At present, this form of energy production has been studied and used in an increasingly intensive way. However, in all the studies and research that can be found, what is verified is a traditional approach, based on an economy of a linear type, purely technical, both in terms of use and in terms of logistics. This book aims to address the issue of energy production from biomass in a circular economy perspective, in all its aspects, namely in all components of the supply chain, production organization, new technologies of use and reuse and revaluation of biomass forms from a circular economy perspective.\"",

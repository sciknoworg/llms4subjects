                "Before embarking on analyses of different aspects of economic growth and development of these countries, the authors present a thought-provoking analysis of how institutional factors such as geography, history of religion, culture and political governance have been deeply interwoven with development dynamics to shape the growth and development trajectory that each country has subsequently followed. Each country\u2019s development path consequently appeared almost be pre-determined. Japan\u2019s role as the lead-country in technology transfer under the flying-geese pattern of development is discussed, however the emphasis has shifted of late to China, India, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. The authors also propose that instead of discussing the failure of India to catch up with China in growth and development outcomes, economists should be commenting on whether China, bestowed with India\u2019s highly decentralized democratic governance structure and institutional rigidities, would have been able to achieve the same results as that of India. Only then will a true understanding and appreciation of India\u2019s achievements in economic growth and development emerge. -- Economic Development in China, India and East Asia will be warmly welcomed and appreciated by academics and researchers of international and development economics as well as Asian development and economics. Policy makers and those involved in NGOs in the development and aid arenas will also find this of great interest. -- \u2018This is an unusually rich and comprehensive comparative analysis of industrialisation and development in Asia. Drawing on the diverse experiences of Malaysia, Singapore, China, India and more, Roy, Blomqvist and Clark skilfully tease out the common institutional threads and the subtle differences in their developmental trajectories. An essential reading for all those interested in the lessons from Asian development.\u2019 (Jude Howell, London School of Economics, UK).",
                "This title presents a novel and timely contribution to the literature on economic development in Asia. By placing up-to-date analyses of the Chinese and Indian experiences alongside more established views of the tiger economies, we see a much more complex yet insightful examination of the processes of economic growth and development"

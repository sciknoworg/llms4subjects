                "Get introduced to Azure Arc-enabled Data Services and the powerful capabilities to deploy and manage local, on-premises, and hybrid cloud data resources using the same centralized management and tooling you get from the Azure cloud. This book shows how you can deploy and manage databases running on SQL Server and Postgres in your corporate data center or any cloud as if they were part of the Azure platform. This second edition has been updated to the latest codebase, allowing you to use this book as your handbook to get started with Azure Arc-enabled Data Services today. Learn how to benefit from Azure's centralized management, the automated rollout of patches and updates, managed backups, and more. This book is the perfect choice for anyone looking for a hybrid or multi-vendor cloud strategy for their data estate. The authors walk you through the possibilities and requirements to get Azure SQL Managed Instance and PostgresSQL Hyperscale deployed outside of Azure, so the services are accessible to companies that cannot move to the cloud or do not want to use the Microsoft cloud exclusively. The technology described in this book will benefit those required to keep sensitive services, such as medical databases, away from the public cloud equally as those who can\u2019t move to a public cloud for other reasons such as infrastructure constraints but still want to benefit from the Azure cloud and the centralized management and tooling that it supports. What You Will Learn Understand the fundamentals and architecture of Azure Arc-enabled data services Build a multi-cloud strategy based on Azure Data Services Deploy Azure Arc-enabled data services on premises or in any cloud Deploy Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance on premises or in any cloud Deploy Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale on premises or in any cloud Backup and Restore your data that is managed by Azure Arc-enabled data services Manage Azure-enabled data services running outside of Azure Monitor Azure-enabled data services through Grafana and Kibana Monitor Azure-enabled data services running outside of Azure through Azure Monitor.",

            "abstract": "The significance of this diagnostic work stems from the fact that it is the first of its kind to be carried out under the One Health perspective in Sudan. The study aligns with the World Bank's growing focus on One Health approach to preparing for and addressing zoonotic and emerging infectious diseases. It systematically draws attention to the links among the integrity of forests and rangelands, land and water management practices, and the ramifications for public health. Studies show that over 30 percent of new diseases that have been reported since 1960 can be attributed to land-use change, including deforestation. Zoonotic diseases, responsible for over 70 percent of emerging infections, pose global risks, as they transfer from animals to humans, impacting health, environment, livelihoods, economies, and sustainable development. Despite this, efforts to control them have been predominantly reactive. The study aims to assess Sudan's susceptibility to zoonotic diseases and related public health threats influenced by multiple drivers and propose ways to better respond to them in more concerted efforts through the lenses of sustainable land and water management practices. It also aims to fulfil the imperative of the World Bank's technical assistance and programmatic nonlending, activity support to projects. In order to achieve this, the study makes recommendations on how to improve implementation capability and maximize outcomes on the ground for other relevant project and program experiences in Sudan and other subregional nations",

            "abstract": "Gender discrimination continues to be a reality in several parts of the world, also in Europe. The aim of this book is to provide an overview of both European Union's (EU) gender policies and gender balance in EU institutions. It does so by looking at gender equality policies and the EU legal system concerning gender equality, women's representation within diff erent institutions (and more particularly in the European External Action Service), gender rights as a type of human rights and the EU's role in the external promotion of womens' rights in third countries. The analysis shows that women's representation in the EU institutions has increased in the last decades and that the EU has strengthened its att ention to gender rights in its external relations as well, however the results of both att empts are far from being fully satisfactory",

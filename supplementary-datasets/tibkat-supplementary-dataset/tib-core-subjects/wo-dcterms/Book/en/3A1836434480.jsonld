            "abstract": "David Bowie\u2019s 2015 Blackstar has been understood by critics and fans alike to have a certain valedictory status. For them, perhaps for us, it is a 39-minute and 13-second farewell. A long goodbye. My angle is different. By situating the Bowie/Renck collaboration on \u201cLazarus\u201d in the context of a meditation on the question once posed by Georg Stanitzek, \u201cWas ist Kommunikation?\u201d I consider the CD and the video as experiments in re-configuration. More specifically, by thinking about the distinctly cinematic iteration of the question of communication (citing here Captain\u2019s \u201cwhat we have here is \u2026 failure to communicate\u201d from Cool Hand Luke) I propose that mediated communication embodies the Ich/Es modality of dialogue disparaged by Martin Buber. What this invites us to consider is whether \u201cLazarus\u201d in particular isn\u2019t the generation of an audiovisual tombeau from which or out of which communication strains are to be heard. Is it \u201csaying\u201d farewell? Is it \u201csaying\u201d anything? By drawing on Jacques Derrida\u2019s appropriation of the crypt in the work of Abraham and Torok, I propose that \u201cLazarus\u201d manages (and the feat is neither small nor insignificant) to communicate nothing. In effect, \u201cLazarus\u201d is the very sound, not of a failure to communicate, but of a \u201cspeaking\u201d emptied of what protects it from mediation. Here, Bowie\u2019s gnomic persona assumes a political valence not typically ascribed to it",

            "abstract": [
                "\"Will China eventually be able to eliminate its socialist animal spirits? This is an important prerequisite to achieving its long-sought transition from extensive to intensive growth. Such a transformation would clearly require removing much of the economic power now enjoyed by local governments while at the same time hardening the budget constraints of the current system's principal beneficiaries. Such changes are unlikely in the absence of political reform. This title highlights the importance of China's investment booms and busts for both the Chinese and the world economy, describes the origins and evolution of the investment cycle during the command economy period. It will show how the animal spirits of the command economy era have been transformed by the introduction of capitalist economic institutions. In order to do so, the author carefully considers the banking system, which more often than not is on the losing side of these bets, a major source of speculative flows into the stock and property markets and the counter-cyclical monetary policy. Concluding, DeWeaver analyzes the use of administrative measures to manage the economy, which still work in much the same way as they did during the command economy period. Ending an investment boom continues to be primarily a matter of introducing new policies or the more strict enforcement of existing ones. And stimulus remains mainly a matter of policy relaxation - particularly the relaxation of financial sector prudential regulation. \"--. - \"Animal Spirits with Chinese Characteristics is the first detailed account of the investment booms and busts that drive China's business cycles. The book looks first at the causes of these fluctuations, then examines the central government's countercyclical policy responses. The author shows that the volatility of Chinese investment is primarily the result of perverse incentives inherited from the command-economy era. Beijing's most effective countercyclical policies therefore still take the form of ad hoc administrative interventions. Contrary to popular belief, Beijing cannot \"fine tune\" the economy. It also stands little chance of transitioning to a less volatile \"mode of growth.\"\"--",

            "abstract": "During the Second World War, crime rates skyrocketed in the occupied Netherlands, particularly concerning theft and other offences against property. These crimes were committed by both those who had been convicted in the prewar period and previously \u2018well-behaved\u2019 citizens. Some of them felt forced to steal by the circumstances, others took advantage of the situation for their own benefit.  How did suspects justify their acts? Did they consider theft during the occupation to be a crime, or not? And how did Dutch judges pass judgement concerning property crimes? Did they have compassion for stealing compatriots, or did they consider theft in times of scarcity and increasing poverty to be a great danger, which should be severely punished? In this book, historian Jan Julia Zurn\u00e9 uses case files and verdicts by Dutch courts to provide insight into the lives, experiences and motivations of wartime thieves",

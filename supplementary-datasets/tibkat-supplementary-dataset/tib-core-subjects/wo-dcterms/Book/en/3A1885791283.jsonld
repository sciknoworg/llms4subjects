            "abstract": "We, as scientists, engineers, consultants, and owners have to provide a sustainable and safe water supply for human consumption in cities, especially metropolitans. Dams and their appurtenant structures are mainly constructed to provide this human demand. As civilizations have matured, dams, which are man-made infrastructures, have been further developed for agriculture, flood control, power, water-based transportation, and recreation. Water storage and effective use of water are important aspects, especially for the countries with unequal rainfall and limited water resources. Therefore, dams pose a critical role in providing standard living conditions. In this book, we desire original research articles focused on the state-of-the-art techniques and methods employed in the various aspects of the design, construction, and analysis of dams. We welcome both theoretical and application studies of high technical standards across various disciplines. We seek high-quality submissions of original research articles as well as review articles on all aspects related to dam engineering that has the potential for practical application. The articles focused on their social and environmental impacts are very valuable studies for us",

            "title": "Global Rapid Post-Disaster Damage Estimation (GRADE) Report : February 6, 2023 Kahramanmaras Earthquakes - Turkiye Report",
            "abstract": "On February 6, 2023, two very large earthquakes of magnitude (Mw) 7.8 and 7.5 occurred nine hours apart on different fault lines in the southern region of Turkiye and northern Syria. These are referred to as the Kahramanmaras earthquakes. In Turkiye, which is the focus of this report, these earthquakes have resulted in widespread damage across 11 provinces, where around 14.01 million (16.5 percent) of Turkiye's population live, including Adana, Adiyaman, Diyarbakir, Elazig, Gaziantep, Hatay, Kahramanmaras, Kilis, Malatya, Osmaniye, and Sanliurfa. As of February 19, 2023, more than 41,020 fatalities have been reported, 108,068 people injured, and more than 1,200,000 people displaced. The objective of this report is to provide an early and preliminary estimate of the direct damage costs caused by these earthquakes, which in turn will inform the response of the World Bank Group and its partners and support planning for recovery and reconstruction. In this report, direct physical damage is quantified using the gross capital stock, which is the replacement cost of an asset newly rebuilt based on current unit costs and construction practice, and although it does include fixed and mobile industry capital, it does not take into account transport equipment, or technological changes, et cetera This report also provides information on the nature of the earthquake events, fixed capital damage costs, and the spatial distribution of damages, which can support recovery and reconstruction planning",

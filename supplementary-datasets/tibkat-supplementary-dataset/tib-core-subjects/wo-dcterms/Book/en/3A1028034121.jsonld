                "This book was written to serve as a graduate-level textbook for special topics classes in mathematics, statistics, and economics, to introduce these topics to other researchers, and for use in short courses. It is an introduction to the theory of majorization and related notions, and contains detailed material on economic applications of majorization and the Lorenz order, investigating the theoretical aspects of these two interrelated orderings. Revising and expanding on an earlier monograph, Majorization and the Lorenz Order: A Brief Introduction, the authors provide a straightforward development and explanation of majorization concepts, addressing historical development of the topics, and providing up-to-date coverage of families of Lorenz curves. The exposition of multivariate Lorenz orderings sets it apart from existing treatments of these topics. Mathematicians, theoretical statisticians, economists, and other social scientists who already recognize the utility of the Lorenz order in income inequality contexts and arenas will find the book useful for its sound development of relevant concepts rigorously linked to both the majorization literature and the even more extensive body of research on economic applications. Barry C. Arnold, PhD, is Distinguished Professor in the Statistics Department at the University of California, Riverside. He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and is an elected member of the International Statistical Institute. He is the author of more than two hundred publications and eight books. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sarabia, PhD, is Professor of Statistics and Quantitative Methods in Business and Economics in the Department of Economics at the University of Cantabria, Spain. He is author of more than one hundred and fifty publications and ten books and is an associate editor of several journals including TEST, Communications in Statistics, and Journal of Statistical Distributions and Applications",

            "abstract": "Leading scientists from different countries around the world contributed valuable essays on the basic applications and safety, as well as the ethical and moral considerations, of the powerful genetic engineering tools now available for modifying the molecules, pathways, and phenotypes of species of agricultural, industrial and even medical importance. After three decades of perfecting such tools, we now see a refined technology, surprisingly unexpected applications, and matured guidelines to avoid unintentional damage to our and other species, as well as the environment, while trying to contribute to solve the biological, medical and technical challenges of society and industry. Chapters on thermo-stabilization of luciferase, engineering of the phenylpropanoid pathway in a species of high demand for the paper industry, more efficient regeneration of transgenic soybean, viral resistant plants, and a novel approach for rapidly screening properties of newly discovered animal growth hormones, illustrate the state-of-the-art science and technology of genetic engineering, but also serve to raise public awareness of the pros and cons that this young scientific discipline has to offer to mankind",

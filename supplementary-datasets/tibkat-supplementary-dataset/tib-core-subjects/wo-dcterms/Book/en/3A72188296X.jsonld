Designed so that its chapters can all stand alone to be read in sequence or out of order as needed, Engine Testing is also an ideal resource for automotive engineers required to perform testing functions whose jobs do not involve engine testing on a regular basis. This recognized standard reference for the subject is now enhanced with new chapters on hybrid testing, OBD (on-board diagnostics) and sensor signals from modern engines. One of few books dedicated to engine testing and a true, recognized market-leader on the subject Covers all key aspects of this large topic, including test-cell design and setup, data management, and dynamometer selection and use, with new chapters on hybrid testing, OBD (on-board diagnostics) and sensor signals from modern engines Brings together otherwise scattered information on the theory and practice of engine testing into one up-to-date reference for automotive engineers who must refer to such knowledge on a daily basis"

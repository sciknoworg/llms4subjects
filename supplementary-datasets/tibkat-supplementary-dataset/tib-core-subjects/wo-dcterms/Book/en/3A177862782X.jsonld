This book is part of the \u201cUna finestra sul mondo del lavoro\u201d project of University of Milano \u2013 Bicocca. The project is promoted by the Students\u2019 Association of Bicocca and the Left Wing List. This book is part of the \u201cA window on the world of work\u201d project of University of Milano \u2013 Bicocca. The project is promoted by the Students\u2019 Association of Bicocca and the Left Wing List. Within this project, graduate students of the Faculty of Law, practitioners and young lawyers specialized in employment law, have joined their skills to create a platform of labour law training for students. This work does not aim to academically and comprehensively treat these subjects: it is rather moved by the spirit of giving to all, non-lawyers as well, the ability to access the raw information to understand the regulation of their employment contract",

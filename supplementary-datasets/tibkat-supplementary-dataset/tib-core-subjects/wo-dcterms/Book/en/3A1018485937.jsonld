We also draw some connections to the contributionsincluded in this volume. Abstracts of these contributions are included as anappendix.Nuel Belnap?s work in logic and in philosophy spans a period of over half a century.During this time, he has followed a number of different research lines, most of themover a period of many years or decades, and often in close collaboration with otherresearchers:1 relevance logic, a long term project starting from a collaboration withAlan Anderson dating back to the late 1950s and continued with Robert Meyerand Michael Dunn into the 1990s; the logic of questions, developed with ThomasSteel in the 1960s and 1970s; display logic in the 1980s and 1990s; the revisiontheory of truth, with Anil Gupta, in the 1990s; and a long-term, continuing interestin indeterminism and free action. This book is devoted to Belnap?s work on the lattertwo topics. In this introduction, we provide a brief overview of some of the formalframeworks and methods involved in thatwork, and we drawsome connections to thecontributions included in this volume. Abstracts of these contributions are presentedin Appendix A",

            "title": "Economic Factors of the Development of Agricultural Markets and Rural Areas",
            "abstract": "The agri-market is one of the core sectors of the economy, responsible for producing goods and the fulfilment of nutritional needs. It includes agriculture, which produces food, and the food industry, which involves processing agricultural products. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the development of agri-markets on both local and international scales. International trade is an important factor affecting the availability of agri-food products. Consequently, it is also important to evaluate economic factors and their roles in the development of a region. This Special Issue aims to solicit original contributions from academics, practitioners and other stakeholders, providing theoretical and empirical analyses focusing on agricultural markets and rural development. The editor encourages submissions that present applications of statistical analysis, case studies, and novel methodologies from parametric and non-parametric related to the topic of the Special Issue. The scope of submission includes original research and review articles on the theme",

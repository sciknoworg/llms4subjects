                "Protectionism is back on the agenda as the financial crisis deepens. With calls for measures that purport to protect low income workers growing louder in the West, it is essential that the economic arguments in favour of free trade and globalization are re-emphasised. Philip Booth and Richard Wellings have brought together key papers originally published by the Institute of Economic Affairs, which, for the past 50 years, has been vigorously defending the case for free trade, and for globalization more generally. These important papers, which are not widely available, trace the development of the debate on the benefits of free trade during the last 50 years. The editors have written an authoritative introduction which offers a comprehensive overview of the arguments for and against globalization",

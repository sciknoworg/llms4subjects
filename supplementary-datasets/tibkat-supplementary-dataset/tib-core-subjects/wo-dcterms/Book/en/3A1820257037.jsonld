            "abstract": "To explore how countries have progressed in learning recovery and longer-term education transformation, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank have conducted the fourth round of the Survey on National Education Responses to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) school closures (joint survey', with responses from Ministries of Education in 93 countries. While the first three rounds of the survey were implemented in relatively rapid succession during the periods May to June 2020, July to October 2020, and February to June 2021, respectively, the fourth round was implemented more than one year after the last data collection during the period April to July 2022, when almost all schools had re-opened and policymakers were beginning to reflect on responses going forward in the post-pandemic normalization period. Findings from the joint survey are supplemented by data from the global education recovery tracker (GERT) survey, administered with 166 World Bank and UNICEF country offices between May to July 2022. This report includes the main findings from the surveys, which are analyzed and presented along the lines of the five RAPID key policy actions. Furthermore, each of these analyses is complemented by a discourse of the policy implications and related measures required for longer-term education transformation to address the longstanding systemic bottlenecks, ensure future system sustainability, and achieve national, regional, and global goals, including sustainable development goal 4 on education",

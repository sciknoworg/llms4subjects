                "Essentially three groups of research workers are con\u00ad cerned with biomaterials. The biophysicists, the biochemists and some bioengineers (particularly the metallurgists) are engaged in a study of the basic properties of engineering materials suitable for medical use and of biological mate\u00ad rials. The bioengineers in general as part of a team are engaged in developing new devices suitable for medical pur\u00ad poses including implantable devices; spectacular examples of such devices are artificial kidney and mechanical heart. The medical people, dentists, surgeons and others, play an impor\u00ad tant role in developing criterions for the biomaterials, in the eValuation of such materials in physiological environment and as consumers of biomaterials. This workshop was an effort to bring together representatives of the above groups to ex\u00ad change experiences and viewpoints in regard to both research and training in this rapidly developing and vital area. The individual presentations are some typical examples of biomaterials research. There are numerous other examples but basically they fall into three categories: materials in medicine, biological materials, and semi-artificial materials derived from biological sources. As a whole, the book pro\u00ad vides a comprehensive but not exhaustive picture of the present state of affairs in the field of biomaterials. To the educators the discussion on training should be of par\u00ad ticular interest. Those concerned with scientific adminis\u00ad trations and policy would find the section on the interaction between government, industry and university very valuable."

            "abstract": "November 2000 - State policies can enormously influence gender equity. They can mitigate cultural constraints on women\u2019s autonomy (as in China and India) or slow the pace of change in gender equity (as in the Republic of Korea). Policies to provide opportunities for women\u2019s empowerment should be accompanied by communication efforts to alter cultural values that limit women\u2019s access to those opportunities. Das Gupta, Lee, Uberoi, Wang, Wang, and Zhang compare changes in gender roles and women\u2019s empowerment in China, India, and the Republic of Korea. Around 1950, these newly formed states were largely poor and agrarian, with common cultural factors that placed similar severe constraints on women\u2019s autonomy. They adopted very different paths of development, which are well known to have profoundly affected development outcomes. These choices have also had a tremendous impact on gender outcomes, and today these countries show striking differences in the extent of gender equity achieved. China has achieved the most gender equity, the Republic of Korea the least. The authors conclude that: States can exert enormous influence over gender equity. They can mitigate cultural constraints on women\u2019s autonomy (as in China and India) or slow the pace of change in gender equity despite women\u2019s rapid integration into education, formal employment, and urbanization (as in the Republic of Korea). The impact of policies to provide opportunities for women\u2019s empowerment can be greatly enhanced if accompanied by communication efforts to alter cultural values that place heavy constraints on women\u2019s access to those opportunities. This paper\u2014a product of Poverty and Human Resources, Development Research Group\u2014is part of a larger effort in the group to examine the institutional bases of social inclusion and poverty reduction.

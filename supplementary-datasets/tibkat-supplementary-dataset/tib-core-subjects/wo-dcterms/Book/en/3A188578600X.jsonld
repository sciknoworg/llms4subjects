            "abstract": "This book gathers together two essays. The first deals with the origins of the character of Farh\u0101d, the unlucky lover of Sh\u012br\u012bn, who \u2013 in the Persian narrative tradition \u2013 digs a route through Mount B\u012bsut\u016bn and accomplishes other admirable works. The essay suggests that Farh\u0101d, as we know him from long narrative poems, historical chronicles, and reports by geographers and travelers, is the issue of a conflation between the legendary character of the Master of Mount B\u012bsut\u016bn and a historical personage, Farrah\u0101n, the general-in-chief of the Sasanid king Khusraw II Parv\u012bz\u2019s army (r. 590-628 EC), as this figure was re-elaborated in a number of later legends. The second essay identifies a character named \u2018B\u016br\u0101n-dukht\u2019 as the prototype from which Turandot, the heroine of the tale well-known in Europe from Puccini\u2019s opera (1926), springs. Two historical personages, both called B\u016br\u0101n or B\u016br\u0101n-dukht, are relevant in this line of development: the first is the daughter of the Sasanid king Khusraw II Parv\u012bz (r. 580-628 CE), who was queen of Persia for a short period (630-631 CE); the other is the daughter of \u1e24asan b. Sahl, wife of Caliph al-Ma\u02bem\u016bn (813-833 CE)",

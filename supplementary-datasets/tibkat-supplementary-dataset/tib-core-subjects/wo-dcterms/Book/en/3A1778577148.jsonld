            "title": "The Amygdala - Where Emotions Shape Perception, Learning and Memories",
            "abstract": "The amygdala is a central component of the limbic system, which is known to play a critical role in emotional processing of learning and memory. Over these last 20 years, major advances in techniques for examining brain activity greatly helped the scientific community to determine the nature of the contribution of the amygdala to these fundamental aspects of cognition. Combined with new conceptual breakthroughs, research data obtained in animals and humans have also provided major insights into our understanding of the processes by which amygdala dysfunction contributes to various brain disorders, such as autism or Alzheimer's disease. Although the primary goal of this book is to inform experts and newcomers of some of the latest data in the field of brain structures involved in the mechanisms underlying emotional learning and memory, we hope it will also help stimulate discussion on the functional role of the amygdala and connected brain structures in these mechanisms",

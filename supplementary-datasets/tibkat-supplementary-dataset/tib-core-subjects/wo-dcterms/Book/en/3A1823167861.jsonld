                "This edited volume contributes to a better understanding of parliamentary changes in times of political transition, and, specifically, the composition of the Greek Parliament before and after the debt crisis. It discusses the profiles of Greek MPs through the lens of continuity and renewal, starting with the first major political crisis after the Metapolitefsi in 1989 and ending with the last legislative elections of 2019. Greece attracted scholarly and international interest due to the transformations that the sovereign debt crisis provoked to its political and partisan system. It is one of the countries of the European periphery most severely hit during the great recession. However, no work so far has been devoted exclusively to the study of Greek parliamentary elites, their cultural and political characteristics, and the factors that shape their selection and election. The book is a multifaceted source of information for all those interested in understanding forms of political representation during normal times and times of crisis. Its distinctive advantage is that it offers an up to date and complete elite study in Greece comparable to similar European studies. Moreover, it is a useful tool for students, scholars and researchers interested in the study of political representation across Europe. Manina Kakepaki is a Principal Researcher at the National Centre for Social Research (EKKE)- Institute of Political Research, Greece. Fani Kountouri is Assistant Professor of Political Science-Political Communication at the Department of Political Science and History, Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences, Athina, Greece."

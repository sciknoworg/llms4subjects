            "abstract": "We are immersed in the so-called digital energy network, continuously introducing new technological advances for a better way of life. Numerous emerging words are in the spotlight, namely: Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Smart Cities, Smart Grid, Industry 4.0, etc. To achieve this formidable goal, systems should work more efficiently, and this fact inevitably leads to power quality (PQ) assurance. Apart from its economic losses, a bad PQ implies serious risks for machines, and consequently for people. Many researchers are endeavoring to develop new analysis techniques, instruments, measurement methods, and new indices and norms that match and fulfil the requirements regarding the current operation of the electrical network. This book offers a compilation of the some recent advances in this field. The chapters range from computing issues to technological implementations, going through event detection strategies and new indices and measurement methods that contribute significantly to the advancement of PQ analysis. Experiments have been developed within the frames of research units and projects, and deal with real data from industry and public buildings. Human beings have an unavoidable commitment with sustainability, which implies adapting PQ monitoring techniques to our dynamic world, defining a digital and smart concept of quality for electricity",

                "\"This insightful book offers a comprehensive exploration of governance structures in microfinance institutions, shedding light on their impact on outreach and sustainability in Bangladesh. Dr. Uddin's thorough analysis, supported by global perspectives and evidence-based recommendations, makes it an invaluable resource for researchers, students, and practitioners in the fields of economics, corporate governance, and microfinance administration\" -- Professor Dr. M Kabir Hassan, Department of Economics and Finance in the University of New Orleans, USA This book identifies the effect of governance structure components on outreach and sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Bangladesh. It is designed to study and understand these structures with reference to the changing forms and functions of MFI administration, in theory and practice, with experiences from selected countries. It helps readers understand corporate governance across the globe with recent developments in this sector. It provides evidence from Bangladesh on what aspects need to be strengthened and identifies the importance of considering differences in institutional values, culture, and environment while pointing to the risk of applying normative assertions of governance structure. The book suggests that a regulatory and supervisory framework should be introduced in Bangladesh to enhance the governance structure of MFIs. It advocates that the sector requires a robust regulatory environment to improve its governance and administrative frameworks and expand the microfinance sector's outreach and sustainability opportunities. It will benefit researchers and students of economics, corporate governance, accountability, transparency, finance, business administration, microfinance institutions, and applied fields, as well as microfinance practitioners, administrators, and policymakers. Md. Nazim Uddin is a Post-doctoral research fellow at International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) and a research fellow at Ankara University, Turkey. He completed PhD in business administration (finance) from IIUM. Dr. Uddin is the author of several books, many book chapters and peer-reviewed articles."

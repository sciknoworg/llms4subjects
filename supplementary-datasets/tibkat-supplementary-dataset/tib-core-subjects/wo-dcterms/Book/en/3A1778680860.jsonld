            "abstract": "Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a rapidly evolving medical field, and will continue to be very exiting in the next few decades. Although the underlying cause of this disease is still unknown, results in research dealing with various issues related to this disease are published every day. Chapters included in this book review the most recent literature on related advancements in regard to this chronic disease, which is controllable but not curable. Aspects like epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetics, incriminated etiologies, clinical aspects, complications, and disease management, including advancements in the diagnostic and therapeutic options, were documented by well known clinicians, researchers, and world wide authorities in their fields. This book on UC will be a valuable addition to each doctor's library interested in this subject, or for physicians dealing with patients suffering from this disease. Authors have also included figures and diagrams to depict their point, and to easily reach the minds of the readers in the simplest way",

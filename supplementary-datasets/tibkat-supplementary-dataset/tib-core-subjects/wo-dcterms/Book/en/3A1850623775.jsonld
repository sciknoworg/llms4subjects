                "This book offers a comprehensive and multidisciplinary global overview of populism and human rights in the light of globalization. It examines why the dominant (neo)liberal paradigm of the last decades resulted in major economic and social inequalities which resulted in the surge of national populism, led by the election success of right-wing parties, movements, and leaders across the world. It discusses, among other topics, the success of Brexit in Britain and the election success of Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen and explains why there is a need for a dialogue on human rights and globalization in this era of populism. Further contributions analyze various important topics of the field, including cross-culturalism, globalization, human rights, challenges and threats, diversity, curbing global corruption, sustainable development, populism, the decline of free speech, the new nationalism, internationalization, global regime of human rights, leadership theory, global management competencies, gender, quality management, individualism-collectivism, and examples of new initiatives in global organizations. This makes the book a valuable and useful resource for students, researchers, and scholars of international relations, political science, sociology, political psychology, law, diplomatic studies, Communication and media studies, economics, education and management, as well as practitioners and policy-makers interested in a better understanding of globalization, populism, and human rights."

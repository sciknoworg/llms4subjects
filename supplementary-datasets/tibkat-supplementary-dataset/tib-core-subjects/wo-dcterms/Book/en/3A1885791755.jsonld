            "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is one of the technologies with the highest expectations for future growth. By creating realistic images and objects, a VR environment gives the user the impression that they are completely engrossed in their surroundings. VR applications that go beyond leisure, tourism, and marketing are now in high demand and thus the technology must be user-friendly and economical. The major technology firms are already striving to create headsets that do not require cables and that allow for high-definition viewing. Artificial intelligence is being used to control VR headsets that have far more powerful CPUs. The new standard will also offer some intriguing capabilities, like the ability to connect huge user communities and additional gadgets. Customers will be able to get photos in real-time in corporate settings, almost as if they were seeing them with their own eyes. This book presents a comprehensive overview of VR applications in medicine, electric vehicles, aviation, architecture, and more",

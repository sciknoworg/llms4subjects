            "abstract": "These remarks were delivered by the World Bank Group President David Malpass at the U.S. Treasury's MDB Governors Roundtable on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and Private Capital Mobilization on October 18, 2022. He mentioned three of the World Bank activities as follows: (i) First is World Bank's trust funds and Financial Intermediary Funds, such as Global Infrastructure Facility and Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, which the Bank established as an Umbrella program to increase their upstream advisory support; (ii) Second, the World Bank actively use guarantees to increase capital flows to infrastructure and is working on ways to catalyze more private capital through appropriate de-risking instruments; and (iii) Third, World Bank's work on Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII) is key to increasing private investment opportunities. He also shared the following three updates: (i) First, he was pleased to see that the G20 adopted the Compendium of QII Indicators; (ii) Second, the World Bank works closely with client countries and development partners at the upstream level to improve the enabling environment for the private sector; and (iii) Third, The World Bank is of course working on new ideas and he welcomed their engagement here too. He said that importantly, the World Bank introduced the SCALE trust fund at last week's Annual Meetings. He concluded by saying that he wants to be using the full suite of World Bank, IFC, and MIGA financing instruments and capabilities to unlock larger volumes of private finance for quality, sustainable infrastructure",

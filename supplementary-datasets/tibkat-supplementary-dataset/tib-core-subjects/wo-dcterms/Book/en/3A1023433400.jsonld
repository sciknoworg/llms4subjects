                "'The search for ways of doing business that are the best for the world is the issue of our time. Add-on CSR is a last-Generation logic that has no value for the now-Generation let alone the next-Generation. This book is a clarion call to the kind of action that both matters and is the landscape of business success in our time.'--Mark Drewell, CEO, The Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative and co-author of Management Education for the World. 'Latin America has received too little world attention for the contributions its companies and governments are making for creating a sustainable world. This wonderful book will correct this problem. The book also makes a major conceptual contribution through its platform idea of the sustainability frontier.'--Robert G. Eccles, Harvard Business School, co-author of One Report, and Founding Chairman, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. 'Corporations in Latin America are facing, more than ever, the demands to put civil society and the natural environment into their business models. This book provides solid frameworks and plenty of real-world examples to help them deal with the challenge.'--Alfredo Enrione, The PwC Endowed Chair of Corporate Governance at ESE Business School, Universidad de los Andes, Chile. 'In the shadow of the Asian economic miracle, the social change in and economic growth of Latin America have often been overlooked, or even ignored. This book takes the Latin American perspective and provides us with deep and rich insights on how sustainability can be integrated into business strategy.'--G\u00fcnter M\u00fcller-Stewens, University of St. Gallen, Switzerland. 'This book is very timely, since corporations require a deeper understanding and new approaches to the challenges and opportunities posed by the concept of sustainability.'--Roberto L. Artavia, Chairman, INCAE Business School and Chairman of Viva Trust. Additional quotes: 'The book provides clear-cut concepts, deals with tough questions, and never offers simplistic answers.'--From the Foreword by Stephan Schmidheiny, Founder, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, co-author of Changing Course, and creator of the term eco-efficiency. 'This book provides the analytical lenses, tools, and cases to chart the course to a sustainable future, starting in Latin America.'--From the Foreword by Stuart L.

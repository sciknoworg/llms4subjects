            "abstract": "Computer games have their basis in mainframe computers from the 1960s. Their spread among people came after the arrival of small (8-bit) home computers. In the beginning, their development was influenced by both the technical and program resources of these computers. These games usually form the first level of communication between a human and a computer. This situation is particularly striking for games on modern computers, game consoles, or smartphones. This book discusses modern approaches, procedures, and algorithms as well as devices in the field of computer game development, with a focus on both the influence of computer science on the development of computer games and the impact of computer games on the development of computer science. Among other things, the book explores virtual reality technologies and visualization, game cores (engines) and platforms, genres, formalizations, correct object-procedural graphic design, trends in interfaces and computer\u2013player interaction, and the development of computer games",

Experimental Stress Analysis 2020 was organized with the support of the Czech Society for Mechanics, Expert Group of Experimental Mechanics, and was, for this particular year, held online in 19-22 October 2020. The objectives of the conference included identification of current situation, sharing professional experience and knowledge, discussing new theoretical and practical findings, and the establishment and strengthening of relationships between universities, companies, and scientists from the field of experimental mechanics in mechanical and civil engineering. The topics of the conference were focused on experimental research on materials and structures subjected to mechanical, thermal-mechanical, and dynamic loading, including damage, fatigue, and fracture analyses. The selected papers deal with top-level contemporary phenomena, such as modern durable materials, numerical modeling and simulations, and innovative non-destructive materials' testing",

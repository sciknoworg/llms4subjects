            "abstract": "This Special Issue of Biomolecules, \u201cPhysics of Protein Folding, Misfolding, and Intrinsic Disorder: A Themed Issue in Honour of Professor Vladimir Uversky on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday\u201d, is a dedication to one of the discoverers of IDPs. This collection is a small token of the respect, admiration, and affection the contributors have for Prof. Vladimir (Volodya) Uversky. It is also a celebration of his illustrious career, and his accomplishments, and contributions to the IDP field that have inspired so many minds worldwide. This Special Issue presents the state of the art as it emerges from the contribution of the community of IDP researchers (IDPers), who have responded to the invitation to give credit to the pioneering work of Prof. Vladimir Uversky aimed at defining the class of disordered proteins and at promoting the attention of scientists toward the existence of \u201cnon-globular proteins\u201d. The papers in this collection show the advancement of our knowledge through the application of an integrative structural approach and witnesses at the same time the interest of the IDPer community toward new concepts (i.e., liquid-liquid phase separation) and new methodological frontiers (i.e., the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to disorder prediction and modelling)",

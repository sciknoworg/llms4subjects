                "Scale mobile applications to handle an enormous user base and development team. This book outlines the scaling challenges that mobile engineers face and some standard techniques and design patterns to deal with those issues. You already know the basics of iOS development, but how do you learn the key concepts and patterns to scale a mobile application? You\u2019ll start by learning the fundamentals of the iOS platform often overlooked when using out-of-the-box iOS solutions. While standard iOS solutions might work at a small scale, the most prominent tech companies reinvent these for highly customized usage, making understanding the underlying concepts crucial. Understanding these concepts reduces ramp-up time and allows engineers to understand the \"why\" intuitively. Having mastered the fundamentals, you'll next focus on architecture and design principles to build, maintain, and release features within a large codebase and the soft skills to enact change in a larger organization. You\u2019ll be empowered with a deeper understanding of iOS design patterns and the industry knowledge necessary to take their features from idea to production. You\u2019ll also study the people skills to get things done in a large organization\u2014a critical step to growing one's career. Upon completing iOS Development at Scale, you'll understand the solutions and tradeoffs you can leverage to build better applications and grow your career. You will: Apply computer science and engineering fundamentals to the iOS platform Implement knowledge of iOS architecture and best practices at large-scale companies Identify current gaps in your product and gain alignment within the broader organization Solve problems with knowledge of systems architecture and industry best practices to identify and address gaps in your codebase."

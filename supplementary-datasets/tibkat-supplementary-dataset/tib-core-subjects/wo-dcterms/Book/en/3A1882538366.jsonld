Covering established theory as well as cutting edge developments in the field, the book is an essential companion to anyone interested in composite materials.Discussing the mechanical properties of advanced composites and their materials, the book describes testing and evaluation, focusing on sustainability in manufacturing. Looking at how composite materials can form structural components, the book is centred around how to design and analyse these materials as appropriate to different applications. It discusses micromechanics, stiffness matrices and numerical calculations using MATLAB, Excel and Python. It also covers failure, applied forces, strain and stress, alongside finite element analysis of composites. The book is suitable for students and researchers in the field of composites, mechanical design, micromechanics, mechanics of solids and material science. It also has relevance to the automotive industry\"--",

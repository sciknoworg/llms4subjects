            "abstract": "Vasculogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation during embryonic development of the cardiovascular system. This is followed by formation of a vascular tree and finally the cardiovascular system with the myriad of blood vessels that nourish all tissues and organs. Angiogenesis, on the other hand is the process by which new blood vessels take shape from existing blood vessels by \"sprouting\" of endothelial cells thus expanding the vascular tree. Both scenarios are based on activation, migration, proliferation and maturation of unique precursor cells. The study of blood vessel formation is an essential component of embryonic development, congenital malformations, degenerative diseases, inflammation and cancer and thus has widespread appeal to the biomedical field. Moreover, scientists are now harnessing this information for the purpose of building living blood vessel substitutes for replacement of diseased arteries and veins. This book highlights novel advances in the field of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, including embryogenesis and development, regulation of progenitor cells, cancer and blood vessel regeneration. We consider this book a good initial source of information for graduate students, medical students and scientists interested in the intricacies of blood vessel formation, maturation, disease and replacement",

            "title": "Progress in Gas Turbine Performance",
            "abstract": "There has been a remarkable difference in the research and development regarding gas turbine technology for transportation and power generation. The former remains substantially florid and unaltered with respect to the past as the superiority of air-breathing engines compared to other technologies is by far immense. On the other hand, the world of gas turbines (GTs) for power generation is indeed characterized by completely different scenarios in so far as new challenges are coming up in the latest energy trends, where both a reduction in the use of carbon-based fuels and the raising up of renewables are becoming more and more important factors. While being considered a key technology for base-load operations for many years, modern stationary gas turbines are in fact facing the challenge to balance electricity from variable renewables with that from flexible conventional power plants. The book intends in fact to provide an updated picture as well as a perspective view of some of the abovementioned issues that characterize GT technology in the two different applications: aircraft propulsion and stationary power generation. Therefore, the target audience for it involves design, analyst, materials and maintenance engineers. Also manufacturers, researchers and scientists will benefit from the timely and accurate information provided in this volume. The book is organized into three main sections including 10 chapters overall: (i) Gas Turbine and Component Performance, (ii) Gas Turbine Combustion and (iii) Fault Detection in Systems and Materials",

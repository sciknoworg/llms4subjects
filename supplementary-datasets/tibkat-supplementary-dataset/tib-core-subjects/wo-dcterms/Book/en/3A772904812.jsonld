                "tenant is looming in importance. The owner is having more influence on the building. As Gerald D. Hines has said, there are indications that the desire for more discretionary time will lead to more residential high-rises dose to or in the midst of downtown office buildings. Downtown living could become the desired alternative. Tall buildings will be approached increasingly from the standpoint of an urban ecology - that what happens to apart can influence the whole. Provid\u00ad ing for public as well as private needs in a tall building project is just one example (facilities for schools, shops, religious, and other needs). More attention will be paid to maintaining streets as lively and interesting places. Will a new \"world's tallest\" be built? Will we go a mile high? The answer is probably \"yes\" to the first, \"no\" to the second. With the recent spate of super-tall buildings on the drawing boards, going to greater heights was in the back of many people's minds at the Chicago conference. But in the U nited States, at least, buildings of 70 to 80 stories would appear to provide needed space consistent with economy. The future, then, is described in depth by papers that go into specific areas.",

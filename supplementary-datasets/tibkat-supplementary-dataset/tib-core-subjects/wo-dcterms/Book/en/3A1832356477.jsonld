            "abstract": "Unhealthy food intake and insufficient physical activities are related to obesity or lifestyle diseases, which can cause cardiovascular diseases, ultimately leading to death. However, many people are not aware of the importance of these factors, especially before cardiovascular development, although there are several good food habits that can be adopted. After the development of obesity or lifestyle diseases, nutrition and exercise control with appropriate medical therapies are required. Still, many patients do not recognize the importance of these habits. After cardiovascular disease development, nutrition and exercise with optimal medical and/or interventional therapies are required. However, some patients are not able to control their food intake and physical activities. At the advanced stage of heart failure, many things are restricted, including food intake and quality of life issues. At the end of life, nutritional care should be discussed. This book, Nutrition, Exercise, and End-of-Life Discussion in the Cardiovascular Field, addresses the importance of nutrition control before and after cardiovascular disease development, which consists of 14 peer-reviewed papers that cover the general population and patients with end-stage cardiovascular diseases",

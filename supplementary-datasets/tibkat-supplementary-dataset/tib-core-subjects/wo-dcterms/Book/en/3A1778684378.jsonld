            "abstract": "Nowadays, embedded systems - computer systems that are embedded in various kinds of devices and play an important role of specific control functions, have permeated various scenes of industry. Therefore, we can hardly discuss our life or society from now onwards without referring to embedded systems. For wide-ranging embedded systems to continue their growth, a number of high-quality fundamental and applied researches are indispensable. This book contains 13 excellent chapters and addresses a wide spectrum of research topics of embedded systems, including parallel computing, communication architecture, application-specific systems, and embedded systems projects. Embedded systems can be made only after fusing miscellaneous technologies together. Various technologies condensed in this book as well as in the complementary book \"Embedded Systems - Theory and Design Methodology\", will be helpful to researchers and engineers around the world",

            "title": "Alloy Steels",
            "abstract": "Alloy steels play a pivotal role in modern society. Their continued development improves the human condition for everyone on earth. Their broad use has resulted in a wide variety of continuing challenges to address economic, manufacturing, and industrial issues. This book contains twenty-three papers covering a wide cross-section of alloy steels and technical problems. Readers interested in solving current manufacturing and application problems will find this issue helpful. The papers contained within cover a wide range of topics by a broad set of authors from across the globe. There are papers covering structure\u2013property relations on various alloys. Other papers discuss the proper processing of alloy steels through the welding, electroslag remelting, and rolling processes. A significant number of the papers cover optimizing the heat treatment of traditional alloys as well as new alloys. There are papers that concentrate on providing real-world performance data on alloy steels, an important but under-studied topic. Of particular interest is a review on the welding of austenitic and duplex stainless steels that gives neophytes and experienced researchers an excellent introduction to the state-of-the-art. This collection of work should be valuable to anyone interested in alloy steels",

            "abstract": "\"Filter circuits play a vital role in diverse applications such as audio/video signal processing, biomedical devices, instrumentation and control. The replacement of many analog circuits by digital filters and modules gave the impetus for further advancements in continuous-time as well as discrete-time analog filters. Today there are important applications such as analog simulation for retransmission, power quality modulation, and prevention of signal-noise-ration problems in multistage amplifiers, where analog filters are either essential or preferred over digital filters. This book is conceived as base material for a first course on active network synthesis at the advanced undergraduate level. It presumes that the reader has already studied basic network theory and analog electronics. After studying this book the student should be able to select an appropriate design technique for a specific application and also be equipped for advanced studies on continuous-time, switched-capacitor or current-mode filters. Focusing mainly on continuous-time domain techniques, this text discusses a wide spectrum of topics. It discusses active filter circuits and their analysis in both frequency and time domains. It includes practical application-based examples and case studies on topics including medical instrumentation, audio/video signal processing, antialiasing and signal conditioning modules. More than 130 solved examples and 370 design problems are interspersed throughout the book. Graphs are plotted throughout the text using the computer simulation tool PSpice\"--",

            "abstract": "Ceramics were arguably the first materials ever synthesized by Man, and they continue to be an invaluable and ever-developing resource. One newly expanding field, for instance, is that of the semiconducting ceramic and its unique high-temperature electronic properties; as reported by the sister-publication to the present one: Defects and Diffusion in Semiconductors - an Annual Retrospective (DDF162-163).The present volume covers ceramics in general, and succinctly summarises recent progress made in the field. This book series is a spin-off and continuation of the 30-year long efforts of the journal, Diffusion and Defect Forum, in keeping the busy researcher up-to-date with the latest data and theoretical trends. A similar issue will appear each year and thereby ensure the continuous monitoring of recent progress; the present volume details those papers published during the approximate period from June 1997 to August 1998. The usually accepted definition of 'ceramic' has been widened slightly herein so as to include, as well as carbides, allotropic forms of carbon and new materials such as fullerenes. In general, priority of coverage is given to the most accessible work and, in particular, to those papers which furnish original data or report important new techniques, phenomena or anomalies. Lower priority has been given to reviews and to entirely theoretical work. This volume also includes invited papers on the topic at hand, as well as on more general themes. Altogether, this will make the present book, and its annual successors, the most up-to-date and convenient source of information on current trends in the field of defects and diffusion in ceramics, and an invaluable aid to the busy researcher.1.

            "abstract": "Epigenetics is one of the most exciting and rapidly developing areas of modern genetics with applications in many disciplines from medicine to agriculture. The most common form of epigenetic modification is DNA methylation, which plays a key role in fundamental developmental processes such as embryogenesis and also in the response of organisms to a wide range of environmental stimuli. Indeed, epigenetics is increasing regarded as one of the major mechanisms used by animals and plants to modulate their genome and its expression to adapt to a wide range of environmental factors. This book brings together a group of experts at the cutting edge of research into DNA methylation and highlights recent advances in methodology and knowledge of underlying mechanisms of this most important of genetic processes. The reader will gain an understanding of the impact, significance and recent advances within the field of epigenetics with a focus on DNA methylation",

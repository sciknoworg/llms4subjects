The aim of the book is to present the most recent advances in the field of nanomaterials, as well as the devices being developed for novel nanoelectronics and nanophotonic systems. It covers the many novel nanoscale applications in microelectronics and photonics that have been developed in recent years. Looking to the future, the book suggests what other applications are currently in development and may become feasible within the next few decades based on novel materials such as graphene, nanotubes, and organic semiconductors. In addition, the inclusion of new chapters and new sections to keep up with the latest developments in this rapidly-evolving field makes Nanotechnology for Microelectronics and Photonics, Second Edition an invaluable reference to research and industrial scientists looking for a guide on how nanostructured materials and nanoscale devices are used in microelectronics, optoelectronics, and photonics today and in future developments",

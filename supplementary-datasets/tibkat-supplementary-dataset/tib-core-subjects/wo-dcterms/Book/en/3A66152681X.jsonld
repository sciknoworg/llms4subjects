Topics addressed in this volume include: a historical review of a cognitive engineering research at a national laboratory; an adaptive learning system approach to designing an integrated-embedded training system; application of PRONET, a method that provides a useful representation of sequences of behaviour in a human-machine interaction; application of CTA, a method to explain the mental processes involved in performing a task; application of human performance modelling technologies in system design and evaluation; a review of training critical thinking skills that individuals and teams require in changing environments; a review of commercial simulations for team research; and research paradigms for human performance research in complex systems",

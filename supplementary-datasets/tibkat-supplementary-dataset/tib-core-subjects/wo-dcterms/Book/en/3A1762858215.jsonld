            "abstract": "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PK-12 education has halted traditional education but has also fostered innovation in distance learning, parental involvement in their children's education, and families' coping mechanisms when forced to \"self-quarantine.\" The educational community is thirsting for strategies, methods, and tools to help with prevention of gaps in the education of youth during this pandemic and in preparation of future global crises.Educational Recovery for PK-12 Education During and After a Pandemic builds awareness of the needs prevalent to the education of PK-12 students effectively during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and provides tools and strategies to assist these students as they grapple with new teaching and learning styles. This book provides timely information to support new modes of teaching and learning during this unprecedented time and fosters traditional methods of education while concurrently respecting guidelines set by the CDC to keep students safe and eliminate gaps in learning. It also benefits the educational community by leading the field in innovative steps to effectively educate PK-12 students so they will continue to be contributing members of society albeit surviving the most devastating epidemic in the last 100 years. Focusing on a wide range of topics such as student mental health, learning gaps, and best teaching practices, this book is ideal for teachers, administrators, district superintendents, counselors, psychologists, social workers, parents, academicians, researchers, and students",

            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, This text has been specifically designed to prepare people with previously limited chemical knowledge for entrance into science related courses (such as Foundation and Access courses) which involve chemistry, in higher education. Until now there have been no texts available for use on these courses and this book fills that gap. Access to Chemistry effectively forms a self-study course, which is split into separate modules and units covering the full spread of concepts required for those needing a basic knowledge of chemistry. The material is presented in a friendly and easy-to-use manner which allows the student to pace their acquisition of knowledge and gain increasing confidence in order to succeed in understanding essential relevant concepts. Other useful features of this book include starter diagnostic tests, worked examples and self study tests (with answers) at the end of each unit. In addition to Access or Foundation course students and their tutors, to whom this book will prove essential, it will have an appeal also as a revision text for those needing a 'refresher' after a break in the subject.  In addition, it will be of interest to members of the general public who wish to better educate themselves on chemical matters, as it provides a clear and useful insight into areas such as health, home chemicals, business market trends and gardening",

            "abstract": "This reprint is a collection of papers in materials science and materials science with a focus on applications and social implementation. The core of this reprint is based on the papers presented at the symposia held at ISATE, an international conference organized by the Organization of National Colleges of Technology in Japan in cooperation with several countries worldwide. This is a compilation of these papers into a reprint. Therefore, this is a wide-ranging collection of papers, including interdisciplinary fields, such as mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, industrial chemistry, bioengineering, civil and architectural engineering, and agriculture. Science and technology are becoming more critical than ever to create a better future and pass the baton to the next generation in a suitable manner. For this purpose, materials science and materials engineering, which are the foundation of all industries, will become increasingly necessary for their implementation in society. We hope that this Special Issue reprint will be of great help to those who are experimenting with such objectives",

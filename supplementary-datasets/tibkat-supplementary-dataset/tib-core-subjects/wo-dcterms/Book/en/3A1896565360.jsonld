                "This book summarizes the past, present, and future work in biotribology with a special emphasis on its applications in the design and manufacture of biomedical devices and their potential future uses. The book covers several aspects of biotribology such as biocompatible materials, joint tribology, skin tribology, oral tribology, tribology of the other human bodies or tissues, animal tribology, plant tribology, medical device tribology, and more. This is an essential reference for academics, biomedical researchers, biologists, tribologists, chemists, physicists, biomedical scientists, materials engineers, mechanical engineers and other professionals in related engineering, medicine, and biomedical industries. This book can also serve as a useful research text for undergraduate and graduate engineering courses such as tribology, materials, biomaterials, material characterization, interface science, and biomedical science.",

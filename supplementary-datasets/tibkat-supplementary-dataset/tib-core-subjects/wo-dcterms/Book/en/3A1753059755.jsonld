                "\u2018Following the Leaders allows Middleton to unmask the logic and impact of contemporary British election campaigns. Marshalling evidence from twelve campaigns over a decade of four general elections, the sophisticated analysis provides new insights into how party and leaders\u2019 campaign strategy is used to bridge the local and national dimensions of the country\u2019s political life\u2019. -R.K. Carty, Professor Emeritus, The University of British Columbia, Canada \u2018This is a fascinating \u2013 and highly original \u2013 account of the activities of party leaders in British elections.\u2019 -David Denver, Emeritus Professor, Lancaster University, UK. This book concentrates on the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats in British general election campaigns between 2010 and 2019, by exploring where they visit during the campaign and why, the impact they have, and how leadership is represented in the Press. It establishes the key strategic underpinnings for their visits, and the types of activities they undertake - in a uniquely British context. The degree to which leaders - and their visits - form an important dimension of voter behaviour is also considered. Moreover, the book explores how the Press delve into the personal lives of lesser-known opposition leaders and scrutinise the policies of Prime Ministers. The types of visits by leaders that become newsworthy are identified alongside their importance as a framing tool in election reporting. Beyond the leaders themselves, press reporting on their personal relationships is scrutinised, showing an increased acceptance of active partnership."

            "abstract": "In 1993, Manning Clark came under severe (posthumous) attack in the pages of Quadrant by none other than Peter Ryan, who had published five of the six volumes of Clark's epic A History of Australia. In applying what he called \"an overdue axe to a tall poppy\", Ryan lambasted the History as \u201can imposition on Australian credulity\u201d and declared its author a fraud, both as a historian and a person. This unprecedented public assault by a publisher on his best-selling author was a sensation at the time and remains lodged in the public memory. In History Wars, Doug Munro forensically examines the right and wrongs of Ryan\u2019s allegations, concluding that Clark was more sinned against than sinning and that Ryan repeatedly misrepresented the situation. More than just telling a story, Munro places the Ryan-Clark controversy within the context of Australia\u2019s History Wars. This book is an illuminating saga of that ongoing contest.\u2019 \u2014 James Curran, University of Sydney \u2018The Ryan-Clark controversy \u2026 speaks to the place of Manning Clark in Australia\u2019s national imagination. Had Ryan taken his axe to another historian, it\u2019s unlikely that we would be still talking about it 30 years later. But Clark was the author and keeper of Australia\u2019s national story, however imperfect his scholarship and however blinkered that story. Few, if any, historians in the Anglo-American world have occupied the space that Clark occupied by dint of will, force of personality, and felicity of pen.\u2019 \u2014 Donald Wright, University of New Brunswick",

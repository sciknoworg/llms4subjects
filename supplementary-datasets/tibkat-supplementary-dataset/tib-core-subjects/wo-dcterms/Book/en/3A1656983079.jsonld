                "This text is a step-by-step guide for students taking a first course in statistics for social work and for social work managers and practitioners who want to learn how to use Excel to solve practical statistics problems in in the workplace, whether or not they have taken a course in statistics. There is no other text for a first course in social work statistics that teaches students, step-by-step, how to use Excel to solve interesting social work statistics problems. Excel 2016 for Social Work Statistics explains statistical formulas and offers practical examples for how students can solve real-world social work statistics problems. This book leaves detailed explanations of statistical theory to other statistics textbooks and focuses entirely on practical, real-world problem solving. Each chapter briefly explains a topic and then demonstrates how to use Excel commands and formulas to solve specific social work statistics problems. This book gives practice in using Excel in two different ways: (1) writing formulas (e.g., confidence interval about the mean, one-group t-test, two-group t-test, correlation) and (2) using Excel\u2019s drop-down formula menus so as not to have to write formulas (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple correlation and multiple regression, and one-way ANOVA). Three practice problems are provided at the end of each chapter, along with their solutions in an Appendix. An additional Practice Test allows readers to test their understanding of each chapter by attempting to solve a specific practical social work statistics problem using Excel; the solution to each of these problems is also given in an Appendix. Presents key steps and examples to solve practical, easy-to-understand social work problems using Excel Contains 163 illustrations in color Suitable for undergraduate and graduate students No background in statistics is required Guides students through not only statistical formulas but also the processes and reasoning that support statistical theory Focuses exclusively on building a critical foundation for students and practitioners Explains statistical theory and formulas in clear language without bogging the reader down in mathematical fine points Features five appendices with tests, answers and statistical formulas Includes specific objectives for concepts in each chapter, as well as practice problems with answers Saves instructors valuable class time by allowing students to learn how to use Excel to solve practical social work p ..."

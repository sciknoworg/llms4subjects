            "abstract": "\"This book provides evolutionary and integrated aspects of industrial power systems including review of development of modern power systems from DC to microgrid. Generation options of thermal, hydro power including nuclear and power from renewables is discussed along with concept for single line diagram, overhead transmission lines, concepts of corona, sag, overhead insulators, and over voltage protective devices. Subsequent chapters cover analysis of power system and power system protection with basic idea of power system planning and economic operations. Features : covers the fundamentals of power systems, including its design, analysis, market structure, and economic operations, discusses performance of transmission lines with associated parameters, and determination of performance, and load flow analysis, reviews residual generation / load imbalance as handled by the automatic generation control (AGC). Includes different advanced technologies like HTLS overhead conductor, XLPE Cable, vacuum / SF6 circuit breaker, solid state relays and others. Explores practical aspects required for field level work like installation of cable network for power distribution purpose, types of earthing, and tariff mechanism. This book aims at Graduate students, Researchers and Professionals in power engineering, load flow, and power systems protection\"--",

                "This scientific monograph presents the results obtained during research in the field of chipless logging and consists of two parts. At the beginning of the book, the current state of the researched task in chipless logging using chipless logging heads is presented. The experimental measurement methodology will be determined after reviewing the theoretical analysis of the cutting heads. The measurement methodology describes the principle of research carried out on an experimental hydraulic stand based on defined parameters. Data obtained during experimental measurement can be analyzed in many areas, e.g. statistical influence of individual factors as well as their combinations. The energy demand of chipless knives is also determined during experimental measurement.",

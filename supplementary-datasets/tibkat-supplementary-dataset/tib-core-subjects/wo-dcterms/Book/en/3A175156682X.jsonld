            "abstract": "\"This book presents a knowledge hub for successful implementation ideas in relation to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Through expert review of successful case studies, readers can draw lessons from the actions that work to positively address target goals. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development identifies 17 Sustainable Development Goals (\"SDGs\") and 169 targets designed to catalyze action in critical areas of importance to humanity and the planet. The effort to implement the SDGs, however, demands a sense of urgency in the face of environmental degradation (including climate change), emerging conflicts and growing inequality. Now in the fifth year since the launch of the 2030 Agenda, this book takes stock of how far the world has come and how we can position ourselves to achieve the global targets. This publication provides a fresh look at implementation through the review and examination of various case studies from across the world; highlighting impactful and creative actions that go beyond the business as usual development efforts. The volume reinforces this analysis with expert recommendations on how to support implementation efforts and achieve the SDGs through both international and national strategies and the involvement of both the public and private sectors. The result is an indispensable textual tool for policy makers, academia, IGOs and NGOs, as well as the public, as we march towards the 2030 deadline.\"",

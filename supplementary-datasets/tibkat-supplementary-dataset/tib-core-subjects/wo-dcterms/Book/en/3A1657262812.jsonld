                "Fluid mechanics is a branch of science dealing with the study of flows of continua under the action of external forces.  It has a rich history and unchanging core of materials, but is constantly expanding and evolving as new methods, applications, and computational tools are developed. This text presents the basic concepts and methods of fluid mechanics, including Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions, tensors of stresses and strains, continuity, momentum, energy, thermodynamics laws, and similarity theory.  The models and their solutions are presented within a context of the mechanics of multiphase media.  The treatment fully utilizes the computer algebra and software system Mathematica\u00ae to both develop concepts and help the reader to master modern methods of solving problems in fluid mechanics. Topics and features: Glossary of over thirty Mathematica\u00ae computer programs Exte nsive, self-contained appendix of Mathematica\u00ae functions and their use Chapter coverage of mechanics of multiphase heterogeneous media Detailed coverage of theory of shock waves in gas dynamics Thorough discussion of aerohydrodynamics of ideal and viscous fluids and gases Complete worked examples with detailed solutions Problem-solving approach Foundations of Fluid Mechanics with Applications is a complete and accessible text or reference for graduates and professionals in mechanics, applied mathematics, physical sciences, materials science, and engineering.  It is an essential resource for the study and use of modern solution methods for problems in fluid mechanics and the underlying mathematical models.  The present, softcover reprint is designed to make this classic textbook available to a wider audience. Reviews The book is well written, and every topic has a rigorous treatment from the mathematical point of view. It is very easy to move through the book since an initial index and a good final subject index are given\u2026 This reviewer certainly recommends the purchase of [this book], since it contains a lot of interesting material not commonly found in usual textbooks. -- Applied Mechanics Review [This book] is a complete and accessible text/reference for graduates and professionals in mechanics, applied mathematics, physical sciences, materials science, and engineering.

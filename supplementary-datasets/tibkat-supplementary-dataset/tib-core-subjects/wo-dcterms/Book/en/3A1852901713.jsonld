                "\u201cThe book is unique and somewhat first of its kind, providing extensive analysis on how sexual and gender- based violence affect marginalised communities...\u201d \u2013\u2013Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, University of Lagos & Executive Director, Women Advocate Research & Documentation Centre, Nigeria \u201cThis book takes an intersectional approach to human rights by exploring the intersection of gender, disability, refugee status, and social class, and in so doing, offers an invaluable contribution to the literature on women\u2019s human rights in Africa.\u201d \u2013\u2013Prof Johanna Bond, Dean Faculty of Law Rutgers University, USA \u201cIt adopts a very unique-multidisciplinary perspective to sexual harassment by analysing it using the human rights based approach, something that has been lacking from the Global South!\u201d \u2013\u2013Dr Linet Sithole, Law Lecturer at Africa University, Zimbabwe This book delves into the endemic and pervasive issue of sexual harassment in Africa, examining it as a gendered expression of power and a gross violation of human rights. It explores sexual harassment in various sectors, including domestic work, academia, and the informal economy, across a range of African countries. The book also highlights the sexual harassment experienced by vulnerable populations, such as internally displaced people, people with disabilities, and women and girls traveling by air. With a keen focus on the intersection of law, feminism, and human rights, the book analyzes the role of the courts and national human rights institutions in addressing sexual harassment, drawing lessons from other jurisdictions. This book is a must-read for researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations interested in gender power relations and women\u2018s rights in Africa and beyond.

Immigrant Students at School: Easing the Journey towards Integration reveals some of the difficulties immigrant students encounter \u2013 and some of the contributions they offer \u2013 as they settle into their new communities and new schools. Results from the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) indicate that students with an immigrant background tend to perform worse in school than students without an immigrant background. Several factors are associated with this disparity, including the concentration of disadvantage in the schools immigrant students attend, language barriers and certain school policies, like grade repetition and tracking, that can hinder immigrant students\u2019 progress through school. But successful integration is measured in more than academic achievement; immigrant students\u2019 well-being and hopes for the future are just as telling. This report examines not only immigrant students\u2019 aspirations and sense of belonging at school, but also recent trends in Europeans\u2019 receptiveness to welcoming immigrants into their own countries \u2013 the context that could make all the difference in how well immigrant students integrate into their new communities. The report includes a special section on refugees and education, and an extensive discussion on education policy responses to immigration.",

            "abstract": "This volume, edited by the organizers of the \u201cDigital Classicist\u201d seminars series, presents research in classical studies, digital classics and digital humanities, bringing together scholarship that addresses the impact of the study of classical antiquity through computational methods on audiences such as scientists, heritage professionals, students and the general public. Within this context, chapters tackle particular aspects, from epigraphy, papyrology and manuscripts, via Greek language, linguistics and literature, to imaging and modelling of artefacts, architecture, and technologies and methods in digital classics research. The book is aimed for scholars in the various fields of history, classical studies, digital humanities and archaeology. It will also be of interest to researchers in library and information sciences, informatics and pedagogy. The chapters will be divided into three sections: Section 1: Teaching will discuss the contribution of digital humanities to pedagogy, teaching and learning in the classics, including the creation of classroom or online materials for the study of languages, texts or topics in ancient history and archaeology, and the teaching of digital humanities techniques such as text encoding and linguistic analysis. All of the chapters in this section acknowledge that the division between digital methods for teaching, and research into digital tools is a porous one, and that digital approaches are helping to break down the divide between the researcher and the student. Section 2: Knowledge Exchange will focus on digital research projects or activities that bring together scholars or practitioners from outside of the traditional disciplines classicists and digital humanists are used to working with, or from outside of academia at all. Collaborations with the medical sciences, with library and cultural heritage institutions, and with media and gaming industries all benefit both parties, with expertise and new insights into research questions moving in both directions. Section 3: Public Engagement will discuss issues such as crowd-sourcing or \u201ccitizen science\u201d, which serves not only to harvest the expertise or enthusiasm of non-specialists on a large scale, but arguably even more profitably engages the crowd with scholarly materials in a way that they might never have considered before; also publications of classical material that are targeted at a non-academic audience: popular books, documentaries, games, open acces ...",

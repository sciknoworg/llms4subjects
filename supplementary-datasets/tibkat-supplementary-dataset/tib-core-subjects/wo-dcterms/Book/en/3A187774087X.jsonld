            "abstract": "This book provides a general introduction to the most important methods of applied geophysics with a variety of case studies. These methods represent a primary tool for investigation of the subsurface and are applicable to a very wide range of problems. Applied geophysics is based on physics principles that collect and interpret data on subsurface conditions for practical purposes, including oil and gas exploration, mineral prospecting, geothermal exploration, groundwater exploration, engineering applications, archeological interests, and environmental concerns. The depth of investigation into applied geophysics is shallow, typically from the ground surface to several kilometers deep, where economic, cultural, engineering, or environmental concerns often arise. Applied geophysics uses almost all of the current geophysical methods, including electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, gravimetric, geothermal, seismic, seismoelectric, magnetotelluric, nuclear, and radioactive methods. In applied geophysics, geophysicists are usually required to have a good understanding of math and physics principles, knowledge of geology and computer skills, and hands-on experience of electronic instruments. A geophysicist's routine job includes survey designs, data acquisition, data processing, and data interpretation with detailed explanation of the study. Applied geophysics consists of three main subject and interest areas, which are exploration geophysics, engineering geophysics, and environmental geophysics",

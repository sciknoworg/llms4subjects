                "This book describes the fundamentals and applicability of the atmospheric-pressure non-thermal plasma surface modification of materials. Non-thermal plasma modification is an effective procedure for chemical activation. In this book, the principles of non-thermal plasma surface modification and its application to various machine parts are described. By reading this book, technologists from a variety of fields can learn about plasma generation and surface treatment technology, which will assist them in performing advanced procedures. This book also explains the basics of atmospheric-pressure plasma and the principle of plasma treatment in an easy-to-understand manner and also provides examples of the application of atmospheric-pressure plasma surface modification technologies to plastics, glass, polymers, and metals. After reading this book, readers can get the knowledge that researchers need to apply the methodology to meet their own research goals. The book is self-contained in the sense that it spans the divide between the fundamentals and more advanced content regarding applications. Many engineers and graduate students working in this field get many helps.",

            "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Economic and financial activity in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) remains stuck in a low gear since the global financial crisis, reflecting weak external demand, tighter funding conditions, and deep seated structural issues. A high system-wide NPL ratio\u201414 percent at end-2014, about two thirds of which are provisioned\u2014reflects the impact of the crisis, low growth since then, and a history of lax lending policies. Bank governance problems, related-party loans and inadequate corporate resolution and insolvency frameworks are obstacles to addressing asset quality problems and re-establishing bank profitability. Institutional fragmentation is delaying much-needed financial sector reforms. Aggregate solvency and liquidity indicators appear broadly sound, but significant pockets of vulnerability exist. The banking system is more than 80 percent foreign-owned banks. The average regulatory capital adequacy ratio exceeded 16 percent as of end 2014. However, the dispersion among banks is wide, ranging from about 7 percent to 48 percent. Vulnerabilities are concentrated within domestically-owned banks, some of which are struggling to meet capital requirements, while some others are relying on public support. Stress tests indicate that these banks have large concentration risks and low liquidity ratios. While the insurance sector is small, a number of companies have thin solvency margins. FSAP team access to supervisory data\u2014at the individual bank level, aggregated along group of banks, and system wide level\u2014was exceptionally good. Decisive and timely actions to deal with weak banks are critical for preserving financial stability. A comprehensive strategy\u2014backed by a credible diagnostic assessment\u2014is needed soon to either facilitate the recovery of these banks (if practicable) or to resolve them in a cost-effective manner that is also consistent with maintaining the stability of the financial system and protecting insured depositors. The timetable for these steps should be spelled out clearly and effectively communicated, and consideration should also be given to a credible and transparent public backstop to deal with potentially systemic cases. Banking and insurance oversight improved since the 2006 FSAP, but a number of important shortcomings remain that have contributed to the vulnerabilities of the financial sector. Cooperation among the various oversight institutions is complex, having potential repercussions in times of stress. Lack o ...",

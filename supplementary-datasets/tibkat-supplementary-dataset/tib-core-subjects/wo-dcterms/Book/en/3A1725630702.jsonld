            "abstract": "\"The aim of this book to provide an up-to-date description of the physical effects of mutual coupling for a variety of antennas and for techniques for analysing and assessing its effects. Practical aspects of mutual coupling will be presented as well as applications to show where the performance is impacted both positively and negatively by taking it into account. Mutual coupling is an important aspect of antenna array design that it is often neglected due to complexity or lack of computing power. It is a function of distance between the antennas, and depends on the near fields of the individual antenna elements, their proximity and their polarization. It can be analysed rigorously by a wide variety of methods from direct computer software using discrete methods, to integral equations and Greens function methods as well as approximate asymptotic methods. The book is directed at technical specialists, researchers and students working on problems connected with mutual interaction between antennas. A background in basic electromagnetics and antennas concepts is assumed\"--",

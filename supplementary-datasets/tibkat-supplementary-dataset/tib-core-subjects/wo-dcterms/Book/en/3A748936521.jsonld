            "title": "Hierarchical Operations and Supply Chain Planning",
            "abstract": "Hierarchical and Supply Chain Planning describes the application of hierarchical planning techniques to all major functional areas of supply chain planning, including production, distribution, warehousing, transportation, inventory management, forecasting and performance management. In particular, the book provides a comprehensive review and understanding of how hierarchical planning techniques and principles can contribute to the effective and efficient management and planning of supply chain activities. The book begins with a review of some well-known, original hierarchical production planning techniques and implementations dating back several decades. Building on this historical base, it then reviews numerous more current hierarchical planning methods and applications covering a wide array of supply chain activities. Additionally the book offers a number of new and original hierarchical planning techniques and algorithms covering different components of supply chain planning. These algorithms range from simple algebraic calculations to mathematical optimization models. The book also offers an original approach for integrating supply chain measurements into measurement systems such as the balanced scorecard which evaluate total firm performance. The book is written to cover the interests of a wide variety of audiences ranging from private industry practitioners, to academic researchers, to students of operations, logistics and supply chain management and planning. It features numerous graphical illustrations highlighting both methods and requirements for integrated hierarchical supply chain planning. \u2026does an excellent job of pulling together much of the literature that relates to hierarchical planning, and presents some new methods and algorithms as well. This book is clearly written and makes good use of tables and diagrams to illustrate the hierarchical nature of the problems studied. I recommend this book for a variety of audiences: researchers interested in obtaining a good understanding of the current state of hierarchical modelling applications, especially optimization, in supply chain management; practitioners interested in implementing specific supply chain modeling applications; and professors interested in having a supplemented, modeling-oriented text for their advanced classes in supply chain, logistics, or operations management.

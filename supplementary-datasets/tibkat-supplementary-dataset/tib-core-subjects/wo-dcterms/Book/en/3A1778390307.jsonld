            "abstract": "This book provides a comprehensive guideline on dynamic analysis and vibration control of axially moving systems. First, the mathematical models of various axially moving systems describing the string, beam, belt, and plate models are developed. Accordingly, dynamical issues such as the equilibrium configuration, critical velocity, stability, bifurcation, and further chaotic dynamics are analyzed. Second, this book covers the design of the control schemes based on the hitherto control strategies for axially moving systems: feedback control using the transfer function, variable structure control, control by regulating the axial velocity, wave cancellation approach, boundary control using the Lyapunov method, adaptive control, and hybrid control methods. Finally, according to the contents discussed in the book, specific aspects are outlined for initiating future research endeavors to be undertaken concerning axially moving systems. This book is useful to graduate students and researchers in industrial sectors such as continuous manufacturing systems, transport systems, power transmission systems, and lifting systems not to mention in academia. .",

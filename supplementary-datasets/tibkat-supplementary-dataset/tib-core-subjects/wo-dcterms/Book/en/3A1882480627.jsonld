                "This volume collects the proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Developments in Mathematics (ICRDM), held at Canadian University Dubai, UAE, in August 2022. This is the second of two volumes, with this volume focusing on more applied topics, particularly mathematical modeling and scientific computing, and the first covering recent advances in algebra and analysis. Each chapter identifies existing research problems, the techniques needed to solve them, and a thorough analysis of the obtained results. Advances in Mathematical Modeling and Scientific Computing will appeal to a range of postgraduate students, researchers, and industry professionals interested in exploring recent advancements in applied mathematics."

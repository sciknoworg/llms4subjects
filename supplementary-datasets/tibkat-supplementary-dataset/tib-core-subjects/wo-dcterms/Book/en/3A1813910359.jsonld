            "abstract": "\"This new volume, Modern Manufacturing Systems: Trends and Developments, explores recent research on advanced technologies and methods in production engineering and its allied technologies, emphasizing effective overall process control and enhanced optimization. The authors include real-life case studies on advanced machining methods, traditional manufacturing technologies, advanced and composite materials, processing with hybrid manufacturing techniques, various joining processes and their applications, micro-structure analysis, and more. The book is divided into parts that discuss studies on conventional manufacturing practices, that examine studies on advanced/matrix composite materials, that present case studies on welding/joining processes, and that highlight studies on advanced/hybrid machining solutions. The authors address the current competitive structure of industrial advancements along with advanced machining processes that are now well proven and commercialized for fruitful processing of technically advanced materials as compared to traditional machining solutions. The chapters investigate methods of optimization under the given cutting conditions and with work material properties to attain the desired characteristics within the required ranges, which ultimately helps to provide quality products to end-customers. The evolutionary algorithms and their performance discussed and explained as well. This volume will keep readers abreast of current and latest research and advances in the competitive area of core production engineering and its allied technologies\"--",

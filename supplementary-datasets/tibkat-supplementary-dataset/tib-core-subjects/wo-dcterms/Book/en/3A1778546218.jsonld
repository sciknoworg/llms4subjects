            "title": "Chapter 28 Basic Structures for a New Theory of Samhandling Under Risk (SUR) : A Model",
            "abstract": "\"This final chapter aggregates experiences and findings from the other chapters of the book. The book\u2019s overall research question is as follows: What are the basic structures of the concept of samhandling under risk and how can samhandling be created when the conditions are unpredictable? A number of SUR (Samhandling Under Risk) structures are derived based on semantic theory construction, and these are described in an overall definition and visualized in a model, which in turn can form the basis of a SUR theory. These are organized under educational, organizational and operational structures, as three superior competencies needed to facilitate effective SUR. The essence is that there is a different basis for this type of assessment than with traditional risk analysis, in order to achieve good samhandling under risk and unforeseen conditions. This is concerned with what is needed when little or nothing goes according to plan. It is then necessary to emphasize on such matters more in depth and addition address other factors to achieve SUR through samhandling where the conditions are predictable - where completed plans and clear objectives work. For the learning level, valuation of inaccurate knowledge and qualities is required to extract information from the disorder. For the organizational level, it is important to create and/or maintain shared leadership and at the operative level, improvisation is essential. When working with a SUR paradigm, one must be able to accept unclear goals, be prepared to lose control and create room for surprises. Leaders with SUR skills will be required to prepare organizations for this. Training and SUR should be incorporated into strategic plans, management training and leadership development. An expansion of established pedagogical models is also needed to achieve this aim. Invisible learning is one approach. Samhandling does not simply happen in a vacuum, and the chapter encourages further SUR research in a global perspective, where different languages and cultures can contribute to enhanced understanding of SUR issues. As a starting point for such an approach, we explore how the term is expressed in the Japanese language. A more global approach to SUR structures can contribute to a deeper understanding of what is needed, to avoid unwanted misunderstandings and crises, learn from each other and solve complex and unforeseen situations through samhandling.\"",

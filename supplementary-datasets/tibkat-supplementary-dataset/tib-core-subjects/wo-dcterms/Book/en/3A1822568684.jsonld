            "abstract": "\"As discussed in the introductory chapter of this textbook, power electronics is an enabling technology for powering information technology and making factory automation feasible. In addition, power electronics has a crucial role to play in providing sustainable electric energy. Most scientists now believe that carbon-based fuels for energy production con- tribute to climate change, which is a serious threat facing human civilization. In the United States, the Department of Energy reports that approximately 40% of all the energy consumed is first converted into electricity. Potentially, use of electric and plug-in hybrid cars, high speed rails, and so on may increase this to even 60%. Therefore, it is essential that we generate electricity from renewable sources such as wind and solar, which at present represent only slightly over 4%, build the next-generation smarter and robust grid to utilize renewable resources often in remote locations, and use electricity in more energy-efficient ways. Undoubtedly, using electricity efficiently and generating it from renewable sources are the twin pillars of sustainability, and as described in this textbook, power electronic systems are a key to them both.\"--",

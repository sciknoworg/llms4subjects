            "abstract": "This self-contained monograph reports the recent approaches, methods and practices of technology-enabled personalized learning. It serves to provide some useful references for researchers and practitioners in the field in conceptualizing and deploying personalized learning. Personalized learning emphasizes student-centred learning that addresses individual learning strengths, needs, skills, and interests, and allows flexibility in the learning mode, process, time and space, where students can take ownership of their learning. It has been practiced in educational institutions at both K-12 and higher education level and, as evident from several successful cases, is an enabler of personalized learning. Educational technology incorporated with other forms of innovative pedagogical practices, such as blended learning, makes personalized learning a reality to achieve its aims effectively and efficiently. This book begins with a critical review on the features and trends of personalized learning. This is followed by a number of case studies on personalized learning practices with promising results. The latest research findings on the approaches, methods and strategies on design and implementation of personalized learning are then reported. Lastly, the prospects of personalized learning are discussed. All these provide some useful references for researchers and practitioners in the field in conceptualizing and deploying personalized learning. Personalized Learning will be a key resource for academics, researchers, and advanced students of education, instructional design and technology, educational research, educational technology, research methods, STEM Education, information and communications technology, and curriculum and instruction. The chapters included in this book were originally published as a special issue of Interactive Learning Environments",

            "abstract": "While the economic growth renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa is widely recognized, much less is known about progress in living conditions. This book comprehensively evaluates trends in living conditions in sixteen major sub-Saharan African countries, corresponding to nearly 75 per cent of the total population. Authors, all with extensive knowledge of the country in question, were charged with conducting a careful assessment of the full range of available evidence to provide a succinct storyline and systematic explanation for trends in living conditions. A striking diversity of experience emerges. While monetary indicators improved in many countries, others are yet to succeed in channelling the benefits of economic growth into the pockets of the poor. Some countries experienced little economic growth, and saw little material progress for the poor. At the same time, the large majority of countries have made impressive progress in key non-monetary indicators of well-being. Overall, the African growth renaissance earns two cheers, but not three. While gains in macroeconomic and political stability are real, they are also fragile. Growth on a per capita basis is much better than in the 1980s and 1990s, yet not rapid compared with other developing regions. Importantly from a pan-African perspective, key economies\u2014particularly Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa\u2014are not among the better performers. Looking forward, realistic expectations are required. The development process is, almost always, a long hard slog. Nevertheless, real and durable factors appear to be at play on the subcontinent with positive implications for growth and poverty reduction in future.",

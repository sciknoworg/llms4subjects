            "abstract": "This book discusses the theory, application, and practice of PID control technology. It is designed for engineers, researchers, students of process control, and industry professionals. It will also be of interest for those seeking an overview of the subject of green automation who need to procure single loop and multi-loop PID controllers and who aim for an exceptional, stable, and robust closed-loop performance through process automation. Process modeling, controller design, and analyses using conventional and heuristic schemes are explained through different applications here. The readers should have primary knowledge of transfer functions, poles, zeros, regulation concepts, and background. The following sections are covered: The Theory of PID Controllers and their Design Methods, Tuning Criteria, Multivariable Systems: Automatic Tuning and Adaptation, Intelligent PID Control, Discrete, Intelligent PID Controller, Fractional Order PID Controllers, Extended Applications of PID, and Practical Applications. A wide variety of researchers and engineers seeking methods of designing and analyzing controllers will create a heavy demand for this book: interdisciplinary researchers, real time process developers, control engineers, instrument technicians, and many more entities that are recognizing the value of shifting to PID controller procurement",

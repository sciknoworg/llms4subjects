            "abstract": "\"The injustice of genocide denial is commonly understood as a violation of the dignity of victims, survivors and their descendants, and further described as an assault on truth and memory. This book rethinks the normative relationship between dignity, truth and memory in relation to genocide denial by adopting the framework of epistemic injustice. This framework performs two functions. First, it introduces constructive normative vocabulary into genocide scholarship through which we can gain a better understanding of the normative impacts of genocide denial when it is institutionalized and systematic. Second, it develops and enriches current scholarship on epistemic injustice with a further, underexplored case study. Genocide denialism is relevant for political and social epistemology, as it presents an institutional practice whereby an alternative worldview is constructed, legitimized and imposed based on factual and normative distortions, which are motivated by domination and oppression. This generates pervasive ignorance that makes denial rather than recognition of genocide appear as the morally and epistemically right thing to do. By focusing on the prominent case of Turkey's denialism of the Armenian genocide, the book shows the serious consequences of this kind of epistemic injustice for the victim group and society as a whole. The Epistemic Injustice of Genocide Denialism will appeal to students and scholars working in social, political and applied epistemology, social and political philosophy, genocide studies, Armenian studies, and memory studies\"--",

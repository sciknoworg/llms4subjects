This book is the first and only global synthesis of information related to constructed treatment wetlands. Types of constructed wetlands, major design parameters, role of vegetation, hydraulic patterns, loadings, treatment efficiency, construction, operation and maintenance costs are discussed in depth. History of the use of constructed wetlands and case studies from various parts of the world are included as well. Constructed Wetlands for Pollution Control will be indispensable for wastewater treatment researchers and designers, decision makers in public authorities, wetland engineers, environmentalists and landscape ecologists. Contents: Biological methods for the treatment of wastewaters - Types of constructed wetland - Applications of the technology - Framework for interpreting and predicting water quality improvement - Mechanisms and results for water quality improvement - Design - Plants and planting - System start-up - Economics - Case studies - Scientific and Technical Report No.8",

            "abstract": "Arising out of a conference on \u2018Er\u00f4s in Ancient Greece\u2019, the articles in this volume share a historicizing approach to the conventions and expectations of er\u00f4s in the context of the polis, in the Archaic and Classical periods of ancient Greece. The articles focus on (post-Homeric) Archaic and Classical poetic genres \u2013 namely lyric poetry, tragedy, and comedy \u2013 and some philosophical texts by Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle. They pursue a variety of issues, including: the connection between homosexual er\u00f4s and politics; sexual practices that fell outside societal norms (aristocratic homosexuality, chastity); the roles of s\u00f4phrosyn\u00ea (self-control) and akrasia (incontinence) in erotic relationships; and the connection between er\u00f4s and other socially important emotions such as charis, philia, and storg\u00ea. The exploration of such issues from a variety of standpoints, and through a range of texts, allows us to place er\u00f4s as an emotion in its socio-political context",

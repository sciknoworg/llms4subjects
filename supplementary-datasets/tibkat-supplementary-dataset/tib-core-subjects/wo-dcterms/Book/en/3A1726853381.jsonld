            "abstract": "The book highlights women\u2019s contributions to science, which have often been marginalized and overlooked throughout history. The book first provides an overview of the development of the various science professions over time - placed in socioeconomic and cultural contexts - and women\u2019s role in the sciences throughout history. The author then exemplifies - through history, example, and case studies - that although women were denied a scientific education until fairly recently in our history, they have nevertheless demonstrated intellect and capability in mathematics, physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and computer sciences throughout time. Biographies of women who contributed to these fields since before the Common Era are interwoven into a discussion of the development of the scientific profession, the advancement of education, the professionalization of the various scientific occupations, and the advancement of women in society. This book is a follow up to the author's book \u201cEngineering Women: Re-visioning Women's Scientific Achievements and Impacts\u201d (Springer 2017). The author, Jill Tietjen, is the series editor for Springer\u2019s Women in Engineering and Science book series. Illuminates the many significant contributions of women in the sciences; Educates readers about the evolution of women\u2019s participation in the scientific fields over the last century; Demonstrates how key scientific advances are driven by socio-economic and cultural contexts.",

            "abstract": "These remarks were delivered by World Bank Group President David Malpass at an event for the Africa Higher Education Centers of Excellence : A Pathway Towards Sustainable Development on October 17, 2022. He congratulated the ACE centers, and their host institutions and governments for working across borders to achieve impressive innovative research outputs and the training of the next generation of Africa's scientists, engineers, ICT specialists and teachers across the priority sectors of education, health, agriculture, STEM, and environment. He also thanked the Association of African Universities (AAU), the Inter-University Council of East Africa, the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD), the French Development Agency (AFD), and the China-World Bank Partnership Facility. He said that the ACE program offers regional specializations which are attracting students, researchers, and industry from the entire continent and enhancing regional integration in Africa. In keeping with the focus on leveraging partnerships, last month the World Bank entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with six Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). He highlighted that the ACEs are a great example of how building coalitions for change can help to enhance tertiary education in Africa. He concluded by saying that he looks forward to hearing about the innovation and impact of the ACEs as he walks through the exhibition",

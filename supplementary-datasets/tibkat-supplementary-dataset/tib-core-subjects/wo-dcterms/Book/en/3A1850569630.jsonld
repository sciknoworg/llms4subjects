The book in detail discusses the core ideas, underlying principles, mathematical formulations, critical reviews and experimentations, and solutions to complex problems from within the domains such as mechanical engineering design and manufacturing, fault detection and diagnosis, control systems, financial systems, machine learning in medical image processing as well as problems from operations research domain. It will serve as a valuable reference to academicians and industry practitioners involved in improving the efficiency, cost, performance, and durability of the products and systems. The chapters in this book may further give impetus to explore new avenues leading towards multidisciplinary research discussions associated with the resilience and sustainability of the existing systems",

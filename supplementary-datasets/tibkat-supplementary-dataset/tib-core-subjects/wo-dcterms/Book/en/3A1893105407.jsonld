                "This book explores Chinese investments in, and cooperation with Pakistan under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Analyzing the BRI\u2019s Pakistan limb, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the book illustrates the hegemonic tug of war between Washington and Beijing in Pakistan. There, China demonstrates its capacity to imprint its modus operandi onto peripheries through channels such as institutions, law, and currency, its economic dominance in production, trade, and finance through the control of quasi-monopolies on high-yielding economic processes (especially renewables and hard infrastructure) fostering trade surpluses which ultimately establish a net stream of inward revenue from Pakistan-as-periphery, military dominance to safeguard these revenue streams and furnish security to Islamabad, and cultural hegemony to socialize it at the level of the individual through media cooperation, state-wide language courses, and foreign education. The book addresses the need for an in-depth and comprehensive examination of a state under the Belt & Road Initiative, and will be of interest to scholars of China, South Asian affairs, international relations generally, and of geopolitics. Toufic Sarieddine was born in Lebanon. He studied at the American University of Beirut and worked at the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees before earning his doctorate from Nagoya University\u2019s Graduate School of International Development. His research focuses on the rise of China in the BRI era and its impact on US hegemony vis-\u00e0-vis the Global South with a focus on the Middle East and Southeast Asia. He currently resides in Nagoya, Japan, where he lectures at the Nagoya University of Foreign Studies and Nagoya City University. A bantering drummer, he listens to Fairouz, The Smiths, French Indie, and City Pop, depending on which world power is behaving the worst in a given week. He strongly recommends playing Sidereal Confluence."

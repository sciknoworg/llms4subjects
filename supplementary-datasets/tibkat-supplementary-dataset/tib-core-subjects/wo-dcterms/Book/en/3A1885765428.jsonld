            "title": "5 Grams : Crack Cocaine, Rap Music, and the War on Drugs",
            "abstract": "In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a law repealing one of the most controversial policies in American criminal justice history: the one hundred to one sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder whereby someone convicted of \u201csimply\u201d possessing five grams of crack\u2014the equivalent of a few sugar packets\u2014had been required by law to serve no less than five years in prison. In this highly original work, Dimitri A. Bogazianos draws on various sources to examine the profound symbolic consequences of America\u2019s reliance on this punishment structure, tracing the rich cultural linkages between America\u2019s War on Drugs, and the creative contributions of those directly affected by its destructive effects. Focusing primarily on lyrics that emerged in 1990s New York rap, which critiqued the music industry for being corrupt, unjust, and criminal, Bogazianos shows how many rappers began drawing parallels between the \u201crap game\u201d and the \u201ccrack game.\" He argues that the symbolism of crack in rap\u2019s stance towards its own commercialization represents a moral debate that is far bigger than hip hop culture, highlighting the degree to which crack cocaine\u2014although a drug long in decline\u2014has come to represent the entire paradoxical predicament of punishment in the U.S. today",

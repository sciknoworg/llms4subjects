                "This book provides profound insights into industrial control system resilience, exploring fundamental and advanced topics and including practical examples and scenarios to support the theoretical approaches. It examines issues related to the safe operation of control systems, risk analysis and assessment, use of attack graphs to evaluate the resiliency of control systems, preventive maintenance, and malware detection and analysis. The book also discusses sensor networks and Internet of Things devices. Moreover, it covers timely responses to malicious attacks and hazardous situations, helping readers select the best approaches to handle such unwanted situations. The book is essential reading for engineers, researchers, and specialists addressing security and safety issues related to the implementation of modern industrial control systems. It is also a valuable resource for students interested in this area"

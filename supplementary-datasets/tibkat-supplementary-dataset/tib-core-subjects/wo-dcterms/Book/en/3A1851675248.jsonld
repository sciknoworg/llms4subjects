            "abstract": "\"The book presents a methodology that uses a collaborative ground for research and design in interior architecture and focuses on water in domestic interiors in the scope of consumption habits, experiences, cultural attitudes and sustainability. The proposed methodology and related processes provide data for design, and create multiple discussion platforms within project studios as well as other design mediums for academics and professionals. The topic is discussed through the process, theoretical discussions and designed products that were revealed in scope of the International Masters Workshop 2022 of IMIAD (International Master of Interior Architectural Design) entitled \"See The Water\". In addition to expressing a physical action, the word \"See\" also connotates making visible, revealing and understanding what cannot be seen directly. It is aimed to unveil water's implicit journey in domestic interiors by discussing both the visible and invisible concepts of water and to discuss the problems at the micro-scale for achieving solutions at the macro-scale. Present approaches within the literature give cause to evaluate the profession over mostly finished and pictorial products rather than ontological and processual means. As a result, the context of the profession is perceived as ornamentation, cladding or decoration rather than spatial and contextual design. The methodology and design approaches presented within the book focus on design thinking and process development together with the final products. Readers will be able to see different perspectives about interior design processes as well as different representation methods in the context of interior architecture\"--",

            "abstract": "Several countries implemented Investment Climate (IC) reforms in the past 20 years focusing on legal and administrative improvements and one-stop-shop integration approaches. However, with the advent of emerging technologies and data availability, the needs and opportunities for greater integration of business licensing and inspections and digitalization of government to business (G2B) service delivery have been growing. Therefore, the next generation of reforms requires a higher level of sophistication and more comprehensive and integrated solutions. To that end, the IC unit developed a new diagnostic tool known as the Maturity Assessment (MA) to better capture the spectrum of maturity and potential reforms that can be considered based on each country's maturity level. The MA aims to help Task Team Leaders (TTLs) carry out a quick diagnostic of licensing and inspections systems. The rationale behind this tool is to allow country teams that design operations and advisory services to take a snapshot of where a jurisdiction stands on business licensing and inspections management. The output of this snapshot can be used to inform project design as well as to produce a high-level estimate of investment needs. The tool is intended to be used by staff and consultants who work on private sector development and who are familiar with the investment climate topics. The MA is an innovation in this area, since it is the first diagnostic on investment climate topics, and on private sector development more broadly, that employs this approach. The authors aim to crystalize the knowledge and lessons learned through the literature and practice by supporting licensing and inspections reforms in different regions and income levels",

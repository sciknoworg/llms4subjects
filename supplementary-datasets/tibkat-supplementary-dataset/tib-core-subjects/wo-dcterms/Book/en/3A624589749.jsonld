            "abstract": "\"The chemistry of the transition metals is a vital part of undergraduate courses in inorganic chemistry and is an essential background for bioinorganic chemistry. This teaching text, together with the accompanying Periodic Table DVD-ROM, provides an introduction to the transition metals, examining the behaviour of the metals and their aqueous ions and complexes.\" \"The book begins, largely using interactive activities and video on the DVD, by introducing the reader to the chemistry of the first-row transition elements in different oxidation states, in particular +2 and +3, and their relative stability. This is followed by a study of coordination chemistry. Later chapters look at theories of metal-ligand bonding and the way models can be used to rationalise many of the properties of transition metals and their compounds, such as colour, magnetism and stereochemistry. Starting with the simple, yet powerful crystal-field approach, the book finishes with a largely pictorial treatment of molecular orbital theory. (A basic knowledge of atomic and molecular orbitals as applied to the main-Group elements is assumed.)\" \"The material in this book is designed to be used either as part of an undergraduate chemistry programme, or for self-directed study.\" \"This book was written as part of the teaching material for the Open University course, S347 Metals and Life. An associated book, Metals and Life also published by RSC Publishing, explores the vital role that metals play in the physiology of animals and plants, and increasingly in medicine.\"--Jacket",

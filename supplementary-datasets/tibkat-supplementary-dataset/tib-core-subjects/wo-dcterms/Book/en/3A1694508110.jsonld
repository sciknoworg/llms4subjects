            "abstract": "\"Job Shop Lean integrates techniques from the Toyota Production System (TPS) that apply to high-mix low-volume with the science of Group Technology and Cellular Manufacturing (GT/CM) to replace those parts of the TPS that pertain solely to high-volume, repeatable processes. GT/CM is the technijcal solution to Lean for high-mix low-volume. Toyota provides the tools to sustain GT/CM, especially the workforce culture and Lean leadership aspects. This informative book: Tackles a subject about which there is no effective book on the market that covers all the important aspects (e.g., concepts, tools, software, real success stories, etc.). Teaches a method/approach (Group Technology and Cellular Manufacturing) that Toyota did not pioneer but was proven to work simultaneously that Ohno (and Toyota) were pioneering the Toyota Production System. Shows how computer-aided problem-solving and IT-aided implementation of the Lean tools actually works in practice. Covers advanced topics such as scheduling, IT-aided problem solving, and flexible automation\"--",

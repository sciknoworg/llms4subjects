                "This book celebrates and mourns the increasing relevance of the 2008 volume of 'Profiling the European Citizen. Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives' (edited by Mireille Hildebrandt & Serge Gutwirth). Both volumes contain in-depth investigations by lawyers, philosophers and computer scientists into the legal, philosophical and computational background of the emerging algorithmic order. In BEING PROFILED:COGITAS ERGO SUM 23 scholars engage with the issues, underpinnings, operations and implications of micro-targeting, data-driven critical infrastructure, ethics-washing, p-hacking and democratic disruption. These issues have now become part of everyday life, reinforcing the urgency of the question: are we becoming what machines infer about us, or are we?This book has been designed as a work of art by Bob van Dijk, the hardcopy has been printed as a limited edition. The separate chapters (2000 word provocations) will become available in open access in 2019"

                "\"Preface Optical communication technology has been extensively developed over the last 50 years, since the proposed idea by Kao and Hockham [1]. However, only over the last 15 years have the concepts of communication foundation, that is, the modulation and demodulation techniques, been applied. This is possible due to processing signals using real and imaginary components in the baseband in the digital domain. The baseband signals can be recovered from the optical passband region using polarization and phase diversity techniques, as well as technology that was developed in the mid-1980s. The principal thrust in the current technique and technology differs distinctively in the processing of baseband signals in the discrete/sampled digital domain with the aid of ultra-high-speed digital signal processors and analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters. Thence, algorithms are required for such digital processing systems. Over the years, we have also witnessed intensive development of digital signal processing algorithms for receivers in wireless transceivers, and especially in band-limited transmission lines to support high-speed data communications [2] for the Internet in its early development phase. We have now witnessed the applications and further development of the algorithms from wireless and digital modems to signal processing in lightwave coherent systems and networks. This book is written to introduce this new and important development direction of optical communication technology. Currently, many research groups and equipment manufacturers attempt to produce real-time processors for practical deployment of these DSP-based coherent transmission systems\"--",
                "\"This book describes modern coherent receiving techniques for optical transmission and aspects of modern digital optical communications in the most basic lines. The chapters provide a fundamental understanding of advanced receiving techniques for transport in the optical and electric domains of multi-gigabits per second by coherent mixing in the optical domain, and then processing in the digital domain at the sampling speed of an extremely high rate. The book also includes simplified descriptions of modulation techniques for such digital transmission systems carried by light waves. It discusses the basic aspects of modern digital optical communications in the most basic lines. In addition, the book covers digital processing techniques and basic algorithms to compensate for impairments and carrier recovery, as well as noise models, analysis, and impact on transmission system performance\"--"

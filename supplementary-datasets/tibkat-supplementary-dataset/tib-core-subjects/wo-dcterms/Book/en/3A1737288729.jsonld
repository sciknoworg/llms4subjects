It will provide case studies and frameworks that organize emerging technologies as well as tools to onboard or reject these technologies. It will also give the general contractor, subcontractor, tech vendor and worker the context to understand where they sit in the broader evolution of construction technology. The industry is in dire need of an overarching, rosetta stone for technology that doesn't skip over key issues like how software actually works, how companies large and small are really onboarding technology, and how the reader can profitably move forward both personally and as part of their company. Books in this area are currently very prescriptive, but few systematically look at what's really working on the ground.\"--",

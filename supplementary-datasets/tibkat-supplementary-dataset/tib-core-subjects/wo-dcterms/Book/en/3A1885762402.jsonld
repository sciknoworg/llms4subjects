            "title": "Chapter 4 Promoting More Equitable Post-School Transitions : Learning from the Experiences of Migrant Youth in England",
            "abstract": "This novel contribution examines the lived experiences of migrants in education in various international contexts, exploring common school system features that promote students\u2019 inclusion and challenge their exclusion. With a range of international contributions and case studies from Canada, the US, Hong Kong, Japan and Europe, the book offers critical, theoretically innovative understandings examining national policies and practices to develop reforms, focusing on agency, heterogeneity and systems of relational spaces for migrant youth. Chapters engage with discussions around differentiated needs of marginalised and vulnerable groups, as well as the importance of superdiversity in studying and developing inclusive systems for migrant youth in education. Offering unique insights, the book outlines a framework for the promotion of inclusive school systems that ultimately look to create quality learning environments that prevent discrimination, and support students\u2019 holistic needs. It will be of great interest to researchers, academics and postgraduate students in the fields of sociology of education, philosophy of education, psychology of education, teacher education and social policy",

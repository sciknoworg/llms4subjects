            "title": "Thermal Power Plants : Advanced Applications",
            "abstract": "Thermal power plants are one of the most important process industries for engineering professionals. Over the past decades, the power sector is facing a number of critical issues; however, the most fundamental challenge is meeting the growing power demand in sustainable and efficient ways. Practicing power plant engineers not only look after operation and maintenance of the plant, but, also look after range of activities including research and development, starting from power generation to environmental aspects of power plants. The book Thermal Power Plants - Advanced Applications introduces analysis of plant performance, energy efficiency, combustion, heat transfer, renewable power generation, catalytic reduction of dissolved oxygen and environmental aspects of combustion residues. This book addresses issues related to both coal fired and steam power plants. The book is suitable for both undergraduate and research higher degree students, and of course for practicing power plant engineers",

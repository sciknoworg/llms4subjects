                "This is a volume originating from the Conference on Partial Differential Equations and Applications, which was held in Moscow in November 2018 in memory of professor Boris Sternin and attracted more than a hundred participants from eighteen countries. The conference was mainly dedicated to partial differential equations on manifolds and their applications in mathematical physics, geometry, topology, and complex analysis. The volume contains selected contributions by leading experts in these fields and presents the current state of the art in several areas of PDE. It will be of interest to researchers and graduate students specializing in partial differential equations, mathematical physics, topology, geometry, and their applications. The readers will benefit from the interplay between these various areas of mathematics.",

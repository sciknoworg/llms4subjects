            "title": "Control and Nonlinear Dynamics on Energy Conversion Systems",
            "abstract": "The ever-increasing need for higher efficiency, smaller size, and lower cost make the analysis, understanding, and design of energy conversion systems extremely important, interesting, and even imperative. One of the most neglected features in the study of such systems is the effect of the inherent nonlinearities on the stability of the system. Due to these nonlinearities, these devices may exhibit undesirable and complex dynamics, which are the focus of many researchers. Even though a lot of research has taken place in this area during the last 20 years, it is still an active research topic for mainstream power engineers. This research has demonstrated that these systems can become unstable with a direct result in increased losses, extra subharmonics, and even uncontrollability/unobservability. The detailed study of these systems can help in the design of smaller, lighter, and less expensive converters that are particularly important in emerging areas of research like electric vehicles, smart grids, renewable energy sources, and others. The aim of this Special Issue is to cover control and nonlinear aspects of instabilities in different energy conversion systems: theoretical, analysis modelling, and practical solutions for such emerging applications. In this Special Issue, we present novel research works in different areas of the control and nonlinear dynamics of energy conversion systems",

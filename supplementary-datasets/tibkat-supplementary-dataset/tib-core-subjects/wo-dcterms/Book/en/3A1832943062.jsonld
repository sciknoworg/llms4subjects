                "Government Poverty and Incentive Pensions in the Nineteenth Century -- The Emergence of the War Welfare Field from Peace to War -- A Social Offensive on the Home Front -- The Last-Ditch Effort to Save the Monarchy -- War Victims, a New Power Factor -- A Republic with \"the Correct National and Social Sensibilities\" -- \"The Public's Interest in Invalids Has Waned.\"",
                "\"This book offers the first integrated account about how late Imperial Austria and the First Austrian Republic responded to the needs of soldiers and their families when they faced adverse consequences of soldiering. It surveys the evolving legal and institutional context from the 19th century to the interwar years as well as the concrete actions taken by public and societal actors in confronting the massive losses in lives, health, and livelihoods during and after the First World War, specifically on the provision of care and welfare for disabled soldiers and dead soldiers' widows and orphans. Straddling the conventional historiographical divide of 1918, this book argues that the revolutions of 1918 was not all-determining in the realm of social policy and welfare politics in the post-Habsburg Central Europe. Rather, a \"social offensive on the home front\" was already initiated in 1917 and gained fresh momentum in 1918 and 1919 thanks to the emergence of war victims themselves as an assertive social movement that the new Austrian Republic sought to court and even partner with. This pivotal period in the Austrian warfare-welfare nexus is part of the longer trajectory of how the Austrian state became self-consciously \"social\" in the age of democratizing mass politics and mass conscription. It is also a story about war and war victim welfare's key roles in the formation of modern Austrian citizenship and statehood.\"",
                "The belligerent country that literally started the First World War, the Habsburg Empire suffered grievously during the global conflict. At the end of the war, it was estimated that 1.2 million soldiers, out of 8 million men and 100,000 women mobilized from an empire of 52 million, perished in service. Among those who lived, the wounded, the disabled, and their dependents constituted at least several million people whose survival was endangered both during and afterthe war. How did the Habsburg Empire confront the scale of the casualties brought about by the First World War? What care and support were offered to disabled soldiers and dead soldiers' surviving dependents? Victims' State offers the first integrated account of how the Austrian half of the empire and the successor Austrian Republic responded to the needs of citizen-soldiers and their families from the nineteenth century to the interwar years. Ke-Chin Hsia traces the policies, ideas, and administrative practices developed over the decades by a range of government, semi-public, and societal actors to deal with the massive losses of lives, health, and livelihoods. The provision of care andwelfare to disabled veterans, war widows, and war orphans shows that compulsory military service and war mobilization profoundly changed the relations between citizens and the Austrian state. The expansion of the Austrian welfare state was consciously undertaken by the Habsburg authorities as well as thesuccessor Austrian Republic to generate support and create legitimacy in times of crisis. In the process, assertive war victims helped create a participatory welfare system and contributed to the democratic transition of 1918-1920. With its incisive analysis, Victims' State underscores the centrality of totalizing war to the making of modern citizenship and the fully-fledged European welfare state"

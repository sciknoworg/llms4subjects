This Special Issue is devoted to probability, statistics, stochastic processes and their different applications in system and network analysis. The Special Issue includes works related to the analysis and applications of different queuing models, which begin with general approaches in modeling queuing systems and networks; an analysis of probabilistic and statistical methods in telecommunication; an asymptotic analysis of queuing networks in the condition of a large load; general complex networks and their structures, e.g., topology and graph theory; mathematical methods and models in smart cities; exclusive statistical methods, such as statistical estimates in bio/ecology, medicine and neural networks; and studies that estimate parameters in complex technical systems, etc. We hope that the scientific results collected in this reprint will help foster future research related to probability, stochastic processes and their applications",

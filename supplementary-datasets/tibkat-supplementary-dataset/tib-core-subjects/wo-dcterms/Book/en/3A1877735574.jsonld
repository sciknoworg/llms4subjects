            "abstract": [
                "This chapter sets out an overall vision and architecture for political staffing and why it is needed. It discusses the privilege of service in political staffing, notes the current crisis in political staffing human resource management but also argues strongly for the potential for positive human resource management. It provides guidance for practitioners by outlining best practice guidance for political staffers, their managers, and reformers. This makes clear the key approaches and tools they need to be aware of and use to improve political offices. Political staffers and advisers need to be properly trained, supported and developed. Not only will this benefit the individuals in the roles, it will provide significant benefit to the politicians they work for and in turn the voters who elect the politicians. Higher quality human resource management for political staffers and advisers will generate multiple long term dividends. It will create higher calibre, more experienced and diverse political staffers who are up and running in their role sooner, perform at a higher level and are retained for longer, preserving institutional knowledge. This will lead to higher functioning offers, generating better outputs, more effectively supported politicians, more strategic decisions, increased delivery of election promises",
                "\"The Human Resource Management of Political Staffers: Insights from Prime Ministers' Advisers and Reformers explores the human resource management of political staffers and advisers who work for politicians. Deeply grounded in the experiences of those who worked in the highest political offices under Prime Ministers Boris Johnson, Justin Trudeau, Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern, it makes the case for better management of staffers by illuminating past problems with the workplace such as extreme workloads, little work-life balance and lack of orientation and training. But it also offers a way forward by combining ad hoc positive experiences into guidance for future best practice. Drawing on interviews with advisers/staffers and practitioners working on HR reform in politics, in four countries - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - it provides a research-informed best practice guide for the staffers/advisers, their managers and reformers which offers practical advice on how to recruit, orientate and train, manage and support staffers and advisers appropriately within the complex political environment. It also conveys the highly skilled roles staffers undertake and the democratic contribution they make. The Human Resource Management of Political Staffers is a must-have guide to current and future advisers, politicians and ministers. Human Resource Management for political staffers is important not just for the individuals but to enable taxpayer-funded staffers to perform more effectively, which will in turn help elected politicians deliver for voters\"--"

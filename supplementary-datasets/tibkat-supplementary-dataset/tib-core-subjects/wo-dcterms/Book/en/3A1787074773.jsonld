                "The present essential contains a number of tips for the successful completion of physics studies. What makes it special is the inspiring style of the author, who studied physics himself and knows what he is talking about. Whether it's keeping lecture notes, working on exercise problems or effectively preparing for exams - this book motivates physics students even in difficult phases of their studies and encourages potential first-year students to dare to study natural sciences. This Springer essential is a translation of the original German 1st edition essentials, Wie man effektiv und nachhaltig Physik studiert by Dimitrij Tschodu, published by Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, part of Springer Nature in 2018. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation. Springer Nature works continuously to further the development of tools for the production of books and on the related technologies to support the authors. The contents Three hours of reading instead of five years of stress How to make your studies easier How you recognize connections and keep them in mind How to prepare for exams effectively The target groups Students of physics and related sciences All those who want to prepare themselves effectively for university The ator Dimitrij Tschodu studied physics and philosophy and is writing his master thesis on machine learning in statistical physics at the University of Leipzig. He is blogger of the site physiphi.com. .",

            "abstract": "How the asset\u2014anything that can be controlled, traded, and capitalized as a revenue stream\u2014has become the primary basis of technoscientific capitalism. In this book, scholars from a range of disciplines argue that the asset\u2014meaning anything that can be controlled, traded, and capitalized as a revenue stream\u2014has become the primary basis of technoscientific capitalism. An asset can be an object or an experience, a sum of money or a life form, a patent or a bodily function. A process of assetization prevails, imposing investment and return as the key rationale, and overtaking commodification and its speculative logic. Although assets can be bought and sold, the point is to get a durable economic rent from them rather than make a killing on the market. Assetization examines how assets are constructed and how a variety of things can be turned into assets, analyzing the interests, activities, skills, organizations, and relations entangled in this process. The contributors consider the assetization of knowledge, including patents, personal data, and biomedical innovation; of infrastructure, including railways and energy; of nature, including mineral deposits, agricultural seeds, and \u201cnatural capital\u201d; and of publics, including such public goods as higher education and \u201cmonetizable social ills.\u201d Taken together, the chapters show the usefulness of assetization as an analytical tool and as an element in the critique of capitalism.

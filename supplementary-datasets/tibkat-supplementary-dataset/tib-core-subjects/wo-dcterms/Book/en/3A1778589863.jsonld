            "abstract": "Gynecologic cancers include malignancies of the female genital tract involving the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries. In the USA, 98,280 women had gynecological cancers in 2015, and 30,440 died of these cancers. World wide, the number of women who had cancers of the female genital tract was 1,085,900, in 2012 and the number of deaths was 417,600. Cancers of the uterus, cervix and ovary are most common. Widespread screening with the Pap test has allowed physicians to find per-cancerous changes in the cervix and vagina. This has assisted in identifying some invasive cancers early. Multidisciplinary team of experts includes specialists in medical oncology, gynecologic oncology, radiology, urology, radiotherapy, and surgery who work together to determine the best treatment approach for the patient. Recent progress in the development of new surgical techniques has transformed the treatment of gynecologic cancers, resulting in greater surgical precision and fewer complications. In addition targeted adjuvant therapy has become useful in improving the oncologic outcome of patients with these cancers",

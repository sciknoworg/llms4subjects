            "abstract": "Highlighting 50 years of curiosity, 'Boundless' is about pushing the limits of \"What's possible?\" It highlights the history of EYP, an interdisciplinary design firm, and its unique culture through a rich body of work. Shared in three parts - roots, complexities, and possibilities - each section tells a story through projects highlighting client dreams, technical challenges, and social and environmental impacts. 0\"Roots\" honours the strong foundations of EYP's 50-year history, including its early grounding in sustainability, preservation, and work with mission-centred clients. It covers a wide mix of transformative projects across higher education, healthcare, and government sectors. 0\"Complexities\" reflects the many opportunities and challenges - design, technical, or otherwise - driving the firm's work over the past two decades. Learn about clients and projects that challenged limits of design, including a green-powered US Embassy; a Planetree hospital; a flexible student maker space, and a state-of-the-art workplace for a national lab. Discover how important existing buildings can be reinvented, like those designed by architectural icons Eero Saarinen and Louis Kahn. 0\"Possibilities\" covers work the firm is engaged with today - either on the boards or under construction - including community centres, national historic treasures, places of diplomacy, hospitals for mental health, centres for student innovation, and buildings inspiring the future of science and technology. It uncovers what's possible when novel designs intersect with cultural insights to create authentic experiences, enhancing people's lives and communities",

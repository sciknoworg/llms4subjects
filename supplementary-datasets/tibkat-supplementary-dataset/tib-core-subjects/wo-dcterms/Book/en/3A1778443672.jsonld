            "abstract": "The \u2018bog bodies\u2019 of north-western Europe have captured the imagination of poets as much as archaeologists, confronting us with human remains where time has stopped \u2013 allowing us to come \u2018face to face\u2019 with individuals from the past. Their exceptional preservation allows us to examine unprecedented details of both their lives and deaths, making us reflect poignantly upon our own mortality. Yet this book argues that they must be resituated within a turbulent world of endemic violence and change, reinterpreting the latest Continental research and new discoveries in this light. The book features a ground-breaking \u2018cold case\u2019 forensic study of Worsley Man: Manchester Museum\u2019s \u2018bog head\u2019 and brings the bogs to life through both natural history and folklore, as places that were rich, fertile, yet dangerous. Finally, it argues that these remains do not just pose practical conservation problems but philosophical dilemmas, compounded by the critical debate on if \u2013 and how \u2013 they should be displayed, with museum exemplars drawn from across the globe",

            "abstract": "\"The book presents a comprehensive overview of the historical, current, and prospective application realms of nano-biotechnological research pertaining to graphene, a carbon-based nanomaterial, and its diverse forms in the fields of food and agriculture, as well as health sciences and technology. Young nanotechnologists and businesses will have access to nanobioanalytical methods. Given the present circumstances, it is crucial to underscore the potential ramifications that diverse forms of graphene nanomaterials could have on the food sector, agricultural methodologies, and healthcare. This book presents an analysis of the potential advantages of graphene-based nanomaterials over traditional materials in the food, agriculture, and health care sectors. This book employs case studies, academic and theoretical literature, technology transfer, innovation, economics, and policy management to underscore the intricate issues associated with graphene nanomaterials. The pioneering text \"Role of Graphene-based Nanomaterials in Food, Agriculture, and Biomedicines\" has the potential to serve as a valuable resource for interdisciplinary researchers, academics, practitioners, policymakers, and professionals operating within the fields of science, technology, engineering, innovation, management, and economics. Features Discuss the different aspects of 'Graphene' as a 2-Dimensional material and its underlying unique physico-chemical properties, synthesis methods, and protocols. The implications of 'Graphene' in the food sciences and its different spoilage detection mechanisms have been encompassed in the book. Explore \"Graphene\" nanomaterials' medical and biomedical uses. With examples, the unique and tailor-made material's uses and prospects in health sciences, pharmaceutics, and biomedical research have been highlighted. Elaborate on \"Graphene\" applications in agriculture and brief the potential of bio-compatible planar conductive nano-scale materials to boost agri-product production, crop development, and crop-infection surveillance\"--",

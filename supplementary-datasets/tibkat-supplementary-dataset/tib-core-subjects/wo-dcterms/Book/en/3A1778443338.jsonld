The chapters in this comprehensive reference explore the latest developments, methods, approaches, and applications of coding theory in a wide variety of fields and endeavours. This book is compiled with a view to provide researchers, academicians, and readers with an in-depth discussion of the latest advances in this field. It consists of twelve chapters from academicians, practitioners, and researchers from different disciplines of life. All the chapters are authored by various researchers around the world covering the field of coding theory and image and video processing. This book mainly focusses on researchers who can do quality research in the area of coding theory and image and video processing and related fields. Each chapter is an independent research study, which will motivate young researchers to think about. These twelve chapters are presented in three sections and will be an eye-opener for all who systematic researchers in these fields",

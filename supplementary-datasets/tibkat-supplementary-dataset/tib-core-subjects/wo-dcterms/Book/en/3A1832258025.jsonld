            "abstract": "Foodborne pathogens represent a major burden on society as they are the cause of high numbers of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths each year. In addition to their detrimental impact on human health, these microorganisms, which include pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi, and a range of parasites, also represent a significant economic cost to food companies in the implementation and constant oversight of food hygiene and safety programs, product recalls, and potential litigation if outbreaks occur. Advancing our current knowledge of the food processing chain and its vulnerabilities to the many factors related to foodborne pathogens (e.g., their stress response, survival and persistence in processing environments, acquisition of virulence factors and antimicrobial drug resistance) is paramount to the development of effective strategies for early detection and control of pathogens, thereby improving food safety.This Special Issue compiled original research articles contributing to a better understanding of the impact of all aspects of foodborne pathogens on food safety",

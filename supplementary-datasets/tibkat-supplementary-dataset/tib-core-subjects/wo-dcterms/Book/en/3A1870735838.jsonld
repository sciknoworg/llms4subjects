            "abstract": "This text covers a first course in bilinear maps and tensor products intending to bring the reader from the beginning of functional analysis to the frontiers of exploration with tensor products. Tensor products, particularly in infinite-dimensional normed spaces, are heavily based on bilinear maps. The author brings these topics together by using bilinear maps as an auxiliary, yet fundamental, tool for accomplishing a consistent, useful, and straightforward theory of tensor products. The author\u2019s usual clear, friendly, and meticulously prepared exposition presents the material in ways that are designed to make grasping concepts easier and simpler. The approach to the subject is uniquely presented from an operator theoretic view. An introductory course in functional analysis is assumed. In order to keep the prerequisites as modest as possible, there are two introductory chapters, one on linear spaces (Chapter 1) and another on normed spaces (Chapter 5), summarizing the background material required for a thorough understanding. The reader who has worked through this text will be well prepared to approach more advanced texts and additional literature on the subject. The book brings the theory of tensor products on Banach spaces to the edges of Grothendieck's theory, and changes the target towards tensor products of bounded linear operators. Both Hilbert-space and Banach-space operator theory are considered and compared from the point of view of tensor products. This is done from the first principles of functional analysis up to current research topics, with complete and detailed proofs. The first four chapters deal with the algebraic theory of linear spaces, providing various representations of the algebraic tensor product defined in an axiomatic way. Chapters 5 and 6 give the necessary background concerning normed spaces and bounded bilinear mappings. Chapter 7 is devoted to the study of reasonable crossnorms on tensor product spaces, discussing in detail the important extreme realizations of injective and projective tensor products. In Chapter 8 uniform crossnorms are introduced in which the tensor products of operators are bounded; special attention is paid to the finitely generated situation. The concluding Chapter 9 is devoted to the study of the Hilbert space setting and the spectral properties of the tensor products of operators. Each chapter ends with a section containing \u201cAdditional Propositions\" and suggested readings for further studies.",

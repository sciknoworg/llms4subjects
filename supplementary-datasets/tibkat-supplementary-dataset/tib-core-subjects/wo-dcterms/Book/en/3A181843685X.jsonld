            "abstract": "\"Corrosion is the chemical or electrochemical reaction between a material, usually a metal, and its environment that produces a deterioration of the material and its properties. Localized corrosion is a form of corrosion where there is a faster rate of disintegration of metal in a small area or zone, while the rest of the surface continues to corrode at a lower rate. It can usually take place when corrosion works with other destructive forces such as stress and fatigue. There are many types of localized corrosion. Crevice corrosion occurs in spaces where access to the surface is limited such as contact areas between parts and inside cracks and seams. Pitting is another form of localized corrosion where small holes are created on the surface of the object. These forms of corrosion can be found everywhere including on bridges and in aircrafts. An example of localized corrosion is the 1992 explosion in Guadalajara, Mexico where a blast injured 1,500 people, damaged 1,600 buildings and caused approximately 75 million dollars worth of damage. This occurred when a pit in a steel gasoline pipe caused a leak into a galvanized steel pipeline leaking gasoline into the sewers.\"--",

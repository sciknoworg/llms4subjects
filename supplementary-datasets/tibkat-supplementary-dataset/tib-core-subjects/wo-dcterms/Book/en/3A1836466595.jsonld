            "abstract": "In the nineteenth century a new type of mystic emerged in Catholic Europe. While cases of stigmatisation had been reported since the thirteenth century, this era witnessed the development of the \u2018stigmatic\u2019: young women who attracted widespread interest thanks to the appearance of physical stigmata. To understand the popularity of these stigmatics we need to regard them as the \u2018saints\u2019 and religious \u2018celebrities\u2019 of their time. With their \u2018miraculous\u2019 bodies, they fit contemporary popular ideas (if not necessarily those of the Church) of what sanctity was. As knowledge about them spread via modern media and their fame became marketable, they developed into religious \u2018celebrities\u2019. Readership: All interested in European religious history of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, those who have an interest in cultural history and/or celebrity studies",

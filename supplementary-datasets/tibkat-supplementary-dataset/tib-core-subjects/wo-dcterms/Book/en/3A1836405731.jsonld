            "abstract": "The name DGGTB (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Geschichte und Theorie der Biologie; German Society for the History and Philosophy of Biology) re\ufb02ects recent history as well as German tradition. The Society is a relatively late addition to a series of German societies of science and medicine that began with the \u201cDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften\u201d, founded in 1910 by Leipzig University\u2019s Karl Sudhoff (1853-1938), who wrote: \u201cWe want to establish a \u2018German\u2019 society in order to gather German-speaking historians together in our special disciplines so that they form the core of an international society\u2026\u201d. Yet Sudhoff, at this time of burgeoning academic internationalism, was \u201cquite willing\u201d to accommodate the wishes of a number of founding members and \u201cdrop the word German in the title of the Society and have it merge with an international society\u201d. The founding and naming of the Society at that time derived from a speci\ufb01 c set of historical circumstances, and the same was true some 80 years later when in 1991, in the wake of German reuni\ufb01cation, the \u201cDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Geschichte und Theorie der Biologie\u201d was founded. From the start, the Society has been committed to bringing studies in the history and philosophy of biology to a wide audience, using for this purpose its Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Geschichte und Theorie der Biologie. Parallel to the Jahrbuch, the Verhandlungen zur Geschichte und Theorie der Biologie has become the by now traditional medium for the publication of papers delivered at the Society\u2019s annual meetings. In 2005 the Jahrbuch was renamed Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology, re\ufb02 ecting the Society\u2019s internationalist aspirations in addressing comparative biology as a subject of historical and philosophical studies",

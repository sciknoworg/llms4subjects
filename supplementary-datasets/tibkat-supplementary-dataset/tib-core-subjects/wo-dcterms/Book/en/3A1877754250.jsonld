            "abstract": "This Special Issue delves deeply into the intricate distinctions between acute and chronic pain. Crucially, chronic pain is more than a mere by-product of sensory input; it entails the activation of a complex brain network intertwined with biopsychosocial factors. As such, its management emerges as a formidable clinical challenge. Within the scope of this Special Issue, focused attention is given to postoperative pain (POP) and chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). POP, characterized by its predictability, intensity, and short duration, contrasts starkly with the potentially persistent and troublesome nature of CPSP, which can endure for over three months if not adequately addressed. The prevention of CPSP takes on paramount importance, with regional anesthesia techniques emerging as promising tools for intervention. The pivotal role of multimodal analgesia and combined therapeutic strategies is underscored. The Special Issue also delves into the intriguing realm of gender differences in pain perception, advocating for further research to illuminate these disparities. Risk factors contributing to the development of chronic pain following surgery are meticulously identified. Lastly, this Special Issue explores the potential of new technologies in the field of telemedicine and artificial intelligence to optimize care delivery, opening new avenues for enhanced patient outcomes and treatment strategies",

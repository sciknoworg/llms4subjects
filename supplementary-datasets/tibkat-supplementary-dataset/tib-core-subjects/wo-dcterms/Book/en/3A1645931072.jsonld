            "abstract": "Wood is one of the best materials for construction on account of its versatility. Among its other outstanding features are its great capacity as a thermal and acoustic insulator, its remarkable ecological character, warm appearance, luminosity and comfort, as well as its pleasant texture and feel. For these reasons, architects and designers use this noble material which offers infinite possibilities for exterior design and decoration. Today, the new planning criteria for sustainable housing benefit from an inexhaustible source of ideas based on products derived from wood. Furthermore, the great variety of available wood and the fact that it is easy to recycle, facilitate the construction of masterful and varied designs. New ways of joining and fixing have been formulated thanks to modern technology. This book presents a selection of thirty of the most relevant international architects who work with wood. It shows different types of construction which unify traditional design with the different styles of modern creations. Focused on the use of wood, the explanatory texts and drawing plans clearly explain the characteristics of wood and its use in sophisticated projects.",

                "\u201cRobertson guides us to a deeper understanding of Swift's intention in writing his tale of Gulliver\u2019s fantastical voyages. We discover an exploration of the permanent questions that characterize human life and define our contemporary dilemma, including: what constitutes knowledge, and how can we ensure it is directed toward the human good? We gain fresh tools to investigate such questions with Robertson as our skillful guide.\u201d \u2014Patrick Malcolmson, Professor Emeritus, Department of Political Science, St. Thomas University, Canada \u201cThis book is a much needed re-discovery of Swift. We can all gain from Robertson\u2019s study a new appreciation of Swift's greatness as a thinker in addition to a literary giant and, of course, a satirist.\u201d \u2014Colin D. Pearce, Lyceum Professor, Lyceum Program, Clemson Institute for the Study of Capitalism, USA This book analyzes Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels from a political philosophy perspective. When authors have focused on politics in Swift\u2019s writings, this has usually meant a study of how Swift located himself on issues of his day such as church and state, and Ireland. Robertson claims by contrast that Gulliver\u2019s Travels is fundamentally a book about the \u201cancients\u201d (e.g. Plato, Aristotle), and the \u201cmoderns\u201d (science and technology), and their contrasting views about the human condition. The claim that the Travels is \u201ca kind of prolegomena\u201d to political philosophy leaves open the possibility that it does not achieve, or seek to achieve, a fusion of various teachings but rather uses the device of alien societies to point us to uncomfortable aspects of political philosophy\u2019s \u201clarger questions\u201d we are prone to ignore. Swift, Robertson argues, draws our attention to some version of the classical republic, as idealized in Aristotle\u2019s political writings and in Plato\u2019s Republic, as opposed to a modern regime which, at its best or most intellectual, emphasizes modern science and technology in combination as a way to improve the human condition. Lloyd W. Robertson is a former lecturer in political science at St. Thomas University in Canada, among other post-secondary institutions.",

                "\u201cThis book raises a timely question: have we delivered on the promise of independence? 19 years following the hard-earned restoration of independence, this book informs the readers about Timor-Leste\u2019s progress thus far and more importantly outlines the challenges which remain. Each of the well-researched and documented chapters, largely by national academics and human rights advocates, speak to our national consciousness about the large number of Timorese who also gave their lives for self-determination and independence; and who are still far from attaining their most basic human rights as enshrined in Timor-Leste\u2019s Constitution, the United Nations Human Rights Charter and the international human rights treaties which Timor-Leste freely entered into. The book is a must read for policy makers as the country struggles to get back on track on achieving the SDGs and a peaceful, inclusive and just society for all Timorese citizens.\u201d --Milena Pires, Former Permanent Representative of Timor-Leste to the United Nations This book offers perspectives from the ground on human rights and peace in Timor-Leste. By highlighting the local voices, this book draws on their experience and expertise in engaging with questions concerning the nexus between human rights, peace and development. It posits that these concepts no longer mean absence of conflict, and argues that sustainable peace must be built from rights frameworks to protect the locals\u2019 interests in the processes. Acknowledging the lack of autonomy on local actors in peace-making contexts, the book emphasizes the urgent need to facilitate the creation of political and social structures that can support and offer contextual rights and dignity for the Timorese community.

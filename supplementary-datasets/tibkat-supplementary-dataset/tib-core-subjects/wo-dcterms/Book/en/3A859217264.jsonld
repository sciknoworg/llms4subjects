                "\"This is an engineering treatise for mechanical engineers who design and analyze optical systems. It also will be of interest to structural engineers in the optical industry and to other optics professionals. As with most engineering treatises, the book is based on both the physical science of, and the practical realities of, designing, analyzing, building, testing, and servicing real optical products. The overwhelming majority of optical challenges that a mechanical engineer faces are associated with the position, orientation, and size of the image at the detector, the image's first-order properties. Control of these properties throughout the mechanical design activity is essential for successful assembly and test of the first systems and is achieved through application of the optomechanical constraint equations. This book presents these equations in detail and shows how they are applied to real optical products. The author hopes that the reader will find this treatise a valuable addition to the literature of optomechanics and a useful addition to the engineer's toolbox\"--",

                "Understand critical cybersecurity and risk perspectives, insights, and tools for the leaders of complex financial systems and markets. This book offers guidance for decision makers and helps establish a framework for communication between cyber leaders and front-line professionals. Information is provided to help in the analysis of cyber challenges and choosing between risk treatment options. Financial cybersecurity is a complex, systemic risk challenge that includes technological and operational elements. The interconnectedness of financial systems and markets creates dynamic, high-risk environments where organizational security is greatly impacted by the level of security effectiveness of partners, counterparties, and other external organizations. The result is a high-risk environment with a growing need for cooperation between enterprises that are otherwise direct competitors. There is a new normal of continuous attack pressures that produce unprecedented enterprise threats that must be met with an array of countermeasures. Financial Cybersecurity Risk Management explores a range of cybersecurity topics impacting financial enterprises. This includes the threat and vulnerability landscape confronting the financial sector, risk assessment practices and methodologies, and cybersecurity data analytics. Governance perspectives, including executive and board considerations, are analyzed as are the appropriate control measures and executive risk reporting. What You\u2019ll Learn: Analyze the threat and vulnerability landscape confronting the financial sector Implement effective technology risk assessment practices and methodologies Craft strategies to treat observed risks in financial systems Improve the effectiveness of enterprise cybersecurity capabilities Evaluate critical aspects of cybersecurity governance, including executive and board oversight Identify significant cybersecurity operational challenges Consider the impact of the cybersecurity mission across the enterprise Leverage cybersecurity regulatory and industry standards to help manage financial services risks Use cybersecurity scenarios to measure systemic risks in financial systems environments Apply key experiences from actual cybersecurity events to develop more robust cybersecurity architectures"

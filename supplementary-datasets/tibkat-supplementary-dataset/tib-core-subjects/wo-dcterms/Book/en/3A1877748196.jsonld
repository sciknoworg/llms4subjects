            "abstract": "These contribution books collect reviews and original articles from eminent experts working in the interdisciplinary arena of biomaterial development and use. From their direct and recent experience, the readers can achieve a wide vision on the new and ongoing potentialities of different synthetic and engineered biomaterials. Contributions were selected not based on a direct market or clinical interest, but on results coming from a very fundamental studies. This too will allow to gain a more general view of what and how the various biomaterials can do and work for, along with the methodologies necessary to design, develop and characterize them, without the restrictions necessary imposed by industrial or profit concerns. Biomaterial constructs and supramolecular assemblies have been studied, for example, as drug and protein carriers, tissue scaffolds, or to manage the interactions between artificial devices and the body. In this volume of the biomaterial series have been gathered in particular reviews and papers focusing on the application of new and known macromolecular compounds to nanotechnology and nanomedicine, along with their chemical and mechanical engineering aimed to fit specific biomedical purposes",

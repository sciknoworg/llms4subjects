These  are the questions that Peter Wagner sets out to answer in this concise  and accessible book.  Wagner begins by returning to the question  of modernity's Western origins and its claims to open up a new and  better era in the history of humanity. Modernity's claims and  expectations have become more prevalent and widely shared, but in the  course of their realization and diffusion they have also been radically  transformed. In an acute and engaging analysis, Wagner examines the  following key issues among others: - Modernity was based on the  hope for freedom and reason, but it created the institutions of  contemporary capitalism and democracy. How does the freedom of the  citizen relate to the freedom of the buyer and seller today? And what  does disaffection with capitalism and democracy entail for the  sustainability of modernity? - Rather than a single model of  modernity, there is now a plurality of forms of modern socio-political  organisation. What does this entail for our idea of progress and our  hope that the future world can be better than the present one? -  All nuance and broadening notwithstanding, our concept of modernity is  in some way inextricably tied to the history of Europe and the West. How  can we compare different forms of modernity in a 'symmetric',  non-biased or non-Eurocentric way? How can we develop a world-sociology  of modernity?",

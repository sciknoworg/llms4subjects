            "abstract": "This volume aims at enlarging our understanding of planning, engineering and more generally regulation ideas by looking at possible forms of mutual interest, circulation of idea and models in a \u201cpan\u2019european\u201d perspective. Contributions will emphasize the role played by actors from both sides of Europe at the micro- as well as macro-level and will highlight the role played by international organizations as fora and platforms where ideas and know-how were exchanged. The volume will also look at development projects in the developing countries as a field where European conceptions of planned development were competing but also converging especially in the eyes of the countries who benefited from these policies",

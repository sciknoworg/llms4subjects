            "abstract": "Herodotus is the epochal authority who inaugurated the European and Western consciousness of collective identity, whether in an awareness of other societies and of the nature of cultural variation itself or in the fashioning of Greek self-awareness \u2013 and necessarily that of later civilizations in\ufb02uenced by the ancient Greeks \u2013 which was perpetually in dialogue and tension with other ways of living in groups. In this book, 14 contributors explore ethnicity \u2013 the very self-understanding of belonging to a separate body of human beings \u2013 and how it evolves and consolidates (or ethnogenesis). This inquiry is focussed through the lens of Herodotus as our earliest master of ethnography, in this instance not only as the stylized portrayal of other societies, but also as an exegesis on how ethnocultural di\ufb00erentiation may a\ufb00ect the lives, and even the very existence, of one\u2019s own people. Ethnicity and Identity in Herodotus is one facet of a project that intends to bring Portuguese and English-speaking scholars of antiquity into closer cooperation. It has united a cross-section of North American classicists with a distinguished cohort of Portuguese and Brazilian experts on Greek literature and history writing in English",

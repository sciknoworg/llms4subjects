            "abstract": "Human societies are highly exposed to climate and weather conditions.. This applies in particular to the pre-industrial period. This volume presents a comprehensive and detailed climate reconstruction for the area of the Burgundian Low Countries in the 15th century. The reconstruction consists of two parts. Detailed weather descriptions from contemporary sources are complemented by systematised indices of seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns.The climate reconstruction serves as the basis for research on the impact of the weather on the economy of the Burgundian Low Countries. For the late Middle Ages grain prices are a very reliable economic indicator. Grain, an indispensable staple food and important merchandise, is directly exposed to the weather for the major part of the year. Statistical analyses of the price development of different grains in conjunction with the seasonal climate indices show a close interlinkage of the two variables. However, climate condition is only one of many factors impacting on grain price; the other factors are also presented and discussed in detail.Finally, the analysis of the development of grain prices reveals three phases of clearly increased prices in the 15th century: during the second half of the 1430s, at the beginning of the 1480s and during the last years of the 1480s until the beginning of the 1490s. The reasons for these grain price peaks, including weather conditions but also economic, political and other factors are outlined in the volume",

            "abstract": "\"Describes the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technological solutions and standards which will enable the migration of voice and SMS services over to LTE/SAE networksCovering radio, packet core and IMS, this book gives a holistic and system-wide view on how voice and SMS services will be provided in 4G mobile networks. Starting from the existing standards, it then gives readers an unbiased and end-to-end view of the standardized future voice technology. The various elements are described from a functional and logical perspective, before the authors explain how the system works from the perspective of call setup and mobility. It also takes an in-depth look at the most important technological issues, and allows readers to judge which of the different alternatives should be chosen for real network scenarios. Covering the technical and practical elements of Voice over LTE (VoLTE), this book explains the various approaches for providing voice services over LTE, a key network due for imminent roll out Focuses on the most important technological issues and allows readers to judge which of the different alternatives should be chosen for a real network Brings vital information for decision makers and those working on the technology and related products, as LTE has substantial cost-saving potential Authors bring a mixed of standards and product background, guaranteeing in-depth practical and standards information Whether a decision maker or technology analyst, this book explains a topic of substantial global market interest in the topic both now and in years to come. It gives a good technical introduction in the area of Voice over LTE and is useful for operators who think of deploying VoLTE, product managers responsible for VoLTE products and also those who work in implementation and standardization of related technologies. \"--",

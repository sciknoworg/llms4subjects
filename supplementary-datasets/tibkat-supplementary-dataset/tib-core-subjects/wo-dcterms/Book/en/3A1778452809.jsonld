            "title": "Emerging Topics in Management Studies",
            "abstract": "Presently, Management has witnessed vast advancements, clearly becoming an area of trans and interdisciplinary knowledge. It has widened its scope from traditional business areas \u2013 such as marketing, strategy, management control, accounting and finance, taxation or operations \u2013 to other spaces, namely deepening bridges with behavioural sciences, engineering, health, or energy, fostering both quantitative models and methods. Management thinking at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Coimbra (FEUC) has followed these trends, enabling students with the essential skills supporting the practice of the profession, both in business and public sector organisations. This book features topical trends of research in Management studies, in which FEUC professors are involved, together with international peers, evidencing the openness of the Faculty to the world. Numerous of the subjects addressed relate to challenges that organisations are already facing or will have to deal with shortly. Therefore, the book not only presents innovative research questions, but it also delivers a practical perspective. Thus, organisations will certainly find here some support to better manage those issues in practice",

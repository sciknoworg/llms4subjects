            "abstract": "The Six Bricks\u00ae initiative is a teaching and learning method that encourages focused engagement in the classroom by all learners, from the foundation phase to adulthood. By using six simple, colourful DUPLO\u00ae bricks, an element of play is introduced into a situation that inevitably leads to all individuals focusing and interacting. This is one of the major contributions to all teaching and learning disciplines and promotes the audience to learn with enjoyment, enthusiasm and concentration. Along with this, communication is promoted, sparking unimaginable creativity and creation. This book provides the reader with an alternative focus to the original educational application of the Six Bricks\u00ae activities. This Six Bricks\u00ae initiative focuses on the therapeutic application and processes in communities, schools and within individuals themselves. As each author has had an intimate connection with Six Bricks\u00ae initiative, they are all more than qualified to provide their autoethnographic reflections on this initiative, which holds so much promise and excitement for learning and teaching. Therefore, each author\u2019s contributions were original and personalised, providing a new field in the avenues of research in the South African context, as South Africa does not have \u2013 as yet \u2013 much research on this topic. The methodology used in this qualitative research study was primarily from each author\u2019s perspective; thus, their self-reflection and anecdotal personal experiences form the core of these chapters. Therefore, this autoethnographic is a self-reflective form of writing which involves self-observation and reflective investigation in the context of ethnographic fieldwork and writing",

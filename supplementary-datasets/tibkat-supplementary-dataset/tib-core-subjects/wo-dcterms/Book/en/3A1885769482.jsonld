            "abstract": "Human use of marine resources is changing, as is the marine environment itself, and our understanding of marine ecosystems and biodiversity is developing. This open access book explores the challenges this raises for legal regimes pertaining to the oceans and their domestic implementation. It engages with developments in areas such as bioprospecting, fisheries, deep-sea mining and shipping. Several case studies discuss genetic resources and the implications of the new UN Agreement on marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. A team of experts suggest new approaches to questions of interpretation, established management principles, and institutional relationships. Not limiting their scope to the international law of the sea, they also examine international environmental law, intellectual property rights, and domestic law. The book broadens the scholarly debate and provides a timely reflection on the dramatic policy developments currently happening in the field of marine resource governance. It will be welcomed by lawyers, NGOs and policymakers. The ebook editions of this book are available open access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licence on bloomsburycollections.com.

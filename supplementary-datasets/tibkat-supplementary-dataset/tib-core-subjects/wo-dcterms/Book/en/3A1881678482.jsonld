                "\u201cThis volume tackles important questions about the role of social criticism in religious studies. It is engaging and illuminating, and I enthusiastically recommend it.\u201d \u2014James F. Childress, University Professor Emeritus, University of Virginia, USA \u201cThis book analyzes, criticizes, and develops the concept of social criticism that contributes to the cultural knowledge of humanity, focusing on religious belief and practice in the study of history, thought, and culture. In short, this book makes a very significant contribution.\u201d \u2014Charles E. Curran, Elizabeth Scurlock University Professor Emeritus of Human Values, Southern Methodist University, USA \u201cWhat is the role of social criticism\u2014the intellectual work of assessing the customs, practices, and policies that shape the moral quality of society\u2014in religious ethics? This volume not only exemplifies the variety and richness of contemporary work in the field; it constitutes an extended argument for the value of social criticism as a core value and method in religious ethics.\u201d \u2014Maria Antonaccio, Presidential Professor of Religious Studies, Bucknell University, USA This volume brings together emerging and established religious ethicists to investigate how those in the field carry forward the practice and tradition of social criticism and, at the same time, how social criticism informs the scholarly values of their field. Contributors reflect on the nature of the moral subject and the ethical weight of human dignity and consider the limits and possibilities of religious humanism in orienting the work of social criticism. They compare religious sources and forms of research in religious ethics to secular sources and the tradition of liberal social criticism. And they offer proposals for how religious ethics can help humanists navigate our complex and multicultural moral landscape and what this field reveals about the ultimate ends of humanistic scholarship. Bharat Ranganathan is the Brooks Assistant Professor of Social Justice and Religion at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where he teaches religious ethics. He is the co-editor of Scripture, Tradition, and Reason in Christian Ethics (Palgrave Macmillan, 2019). Caroline Anglim is Assistant Professor of Bioethics and Professionalism at the Mercer University School of Medicine in Macon, GA. She teaches professional ethics and topics in the medical humanities.",

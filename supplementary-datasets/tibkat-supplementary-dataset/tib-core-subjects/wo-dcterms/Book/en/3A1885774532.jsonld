            "abstract": "The Road to Batemans Bay is the story of competing ventures to                    create 'the Great Southern Township' on the South Coast of New South                    Wales in the early 1840s. The idea of developing the furthest reaches of                    settlement was linked to the hopes of southern woolgrowers for a road from their                    properties to the coast, over the Great Dividing Range. The township proponents                    dreamed that having a quicker and cheaper connection to Sydney would allow them                    to open a port second only to Port Jackson. The scene begins with the proposed                    coastal township of St Vincent, in an age of optimism: settlement is expanding,                    exports are growing and land prices are soaring, generating Australia\u2019s first                    land boom. Before long, however, the colony experiences a catastrophic economic                    depression whose \u2018pestilential breath\u2019 infects those with a stake in the coastal                    townships. Alastair Greig follows the fate of these individuals, while also                    speculating on the broader fate of South Coast development during the                    mid-nineteenth century. Greig gives a unique insight into many aspects of                    colonial life\u2014including the worlds of Sydney\u2019s merchants, auctioneers, land                    speculators, surveyors, map-makers and lawyers\u2014as well as its maritime                    challenges. The Road to Batemans Bay is a chronicle of how Australia first                    developed its land-gambling habit and how land speculation led to the road to                    ruin",

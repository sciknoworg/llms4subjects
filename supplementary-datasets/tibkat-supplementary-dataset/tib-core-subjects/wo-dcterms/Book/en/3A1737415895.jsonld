            "abstract": "\"This book reviews the latest research, development, and future potential of polyimides and green polymer chemistry. It combines the major interdisciplinary research in this area. Polymers with imidic structure, known as polyimides, are widely investigated owing to their practical implications in numerous industrial sectors. The book explains why polyimides offer versatility unparalleled in comparison to most other classes of macromolecules. In addition, developments in green polymer chemistry in this area have been stimulated by health and environmental concerns, interest in sustainability, desire to decrease the dependence on petroleum, and opportunities to design and produce \"green\" products and processes. Major advances include new uses of green processing methodologies, and green polymeric products. Imidic Polymers and Green Polymer Chemistry: New Technology and Developments in Process and Products is targeted to scientists, engineers, and students who are involved or interested in green polymer chemistry and imidic polymers. This book will serve as a valuable reference for those with an interest in synthesis of polyimides and the chemistry and physical chemistry of polyimide compounds. Key features: Shows how polymers with imidic structure, known as polyimides, are noted for their practical implications in numerous industrial sectors Explains polyimides' unparalleled versatility and how they can be tailor-made to suit specific applications Provides an overview of the latest developments in green polymer chemistry materials and their applications in real life\"--",

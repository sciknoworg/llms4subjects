            "abstract": "Unlike most writing on Arab-Iran relations, which looks at specific episodes and specific countries, this book, taking a long term view, assesses the overall dynamics of the relationship, discussing in particular how far religion or politics drives the relationship. It argues that although Iran asserts that religion is a key factor underpinning a coherent approach to international relations, in fact what turns out to be the key factor is the politics of particular circumstances and Iran\u2019s specific interests. The book considers Iran\u2019s differing reactions to the Arab uprisings of 2011 onwards, showing that while Iran supported the uprisings in some countries it sided with repressive governments in other countries. The book also examines Iran\u2019s reaction to its own outbreak of popular discontent in 2009 which was controlled by what has been considered as severe repression and explores how Iran is viewed by ordinary people in different Arab countries",

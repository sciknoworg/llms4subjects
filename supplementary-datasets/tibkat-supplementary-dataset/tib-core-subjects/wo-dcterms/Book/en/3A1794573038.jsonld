                "\"The Routledge Handbook of Translation and Media provides the first comprehensive account of the role of translation in the media, which has become a thriving area of research in recent decades. It offers theoretical and methodological perspectives on translation and media in the digital age, as well as analyses of a wide diversity of media contexts and translation forms. Divided into four parts with an editor introduction, the 33 chapters are written by leading international experts and provide a critical survey of each area with suggestions for further reading. The handbook aims to showcase innovative approaches and developments, bridging the gap between currently separate disciplinary subfields and pointing to potential synergies and broad research topics and issues. With a broad-ranging, critical and interdisciplinary perspective, this handbook is an indispensable resource for all students and researchers of translation studies, audiovisual translation, journalism studies, film studies and media studies\"--",
                "Translation history and literary translation, on the one hand, and periodical publications, on the other, have been extensively analysed within the fields of translation studies, comparative literature, and media studies, with numerous conferences and publications taking literary translation and the periodical as objects of enquiry. However, the relationship between both fields still remains underexplored and nationalistic approaches and disciplinary boundaries have precluded the development of further conceptual and methodological insights regarding literary translation and the media. This chapter highlights the innovative theoretical and methodological issues intrinsic to analysing literary translation in periodical publications at both small and large scales, whether using or not digital tools, and sheds light on its qualitative implications for research. To do so, we briefly present a case study related to the Spanish-speaking world\u2019s literary journals at the beginning of the twentieth century"

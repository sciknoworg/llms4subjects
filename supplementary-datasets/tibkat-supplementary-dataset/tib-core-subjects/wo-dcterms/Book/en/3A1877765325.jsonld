            "title": "The lives and work of 12 further education based teacher educators in England",
            "abstract": "This publication was inspired by the work of two Dutch teacher educators, Peter Lorist and Anja Swennen, who have done so much to promote understanding of the lives and work of teacher educators. What is distinctive about this booklet is that it exclusively focuses on one type of teacher educator working in one country: further education (FE) based teacher educators in England. Building on Noel\u2019s research into the \u2018secret life\u2019 of the FE based teacher educator, this booklet incorporates the directly told stories of 12 FE based teacher educators together with discussion and analysis which explores how they became teachers and then teacher educators. It considers the context of their work and explicates some common themes. Petrie asserted that \u2018writing about FE is\u2026to draw a map\u2019 of it. As such, this booklet adds new detail to the still largely underdeveloped \u2018map\u2019 of FE initial teacher education. It is both an invitation to researchers to identify \u2018areas of the map for exploration\u2019 and a resource for teacher educators, particularly, those inducting and working with FE\u2019s new teacher educators",

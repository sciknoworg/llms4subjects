            "abstract": "In this original study, Siobh\u00e1n McIlvanney examines the beginnings of the women\u2019s press in France. Figurations of the Feminine is the first work in English to assess the most significant publications which make up this diverse, yet critically neglected, medium. It traces the evolving representations of womanhood that appear over the first ninety years of women\u2019s journals in France. McIlvanney\u2019s insightful readings demonstrate that these journals are often characterised by a remarkable degree of \u2018feminist\u2019 content. This refutes the general conception of the women\u2019s press as an idealised, hyper-feminised space inhabited by the intellectually idle \u2013 whether in the form of readers or writers \u2013 disseminating and legitimating a limited range of patriarchal stereotypes and id\u00e9es re\u00e7ues. Through textual analyses of different \u2018generic\u2019 subsections, whether the literary journal, the fashion magazine, the domestic press or more explicitly politicised outputs, Figurations of the Feminine challenges the critical commonplaces which have been applied to the women\u2019s press since its genesis, both in France and elsewhere. It demonstrates the political richness of this medium and the privileged perspectives it gives us on female self-expression and on the everyday lives of French women from across the class spectrum during this key historical period",

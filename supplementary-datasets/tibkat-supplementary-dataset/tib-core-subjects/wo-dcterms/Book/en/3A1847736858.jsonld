            "abstract": "\"This book covers fluid dynamics and fluvial processes, including basics applicable to open channel flow followed by turbulence characteristics related to the sediment-laden flows and environmental diffusion. It presents well-balanced exposure of physical concepts, mathematical treatments, validation of the models/theories, and experimentations using modern electronic gadgets within the scope. In addition, it explores fluid motions, sediment-fluid interactions, erosion and scouring, sediment suspension and bed load transportation, image processing for particle dynamics, dispersion of contaminant materials, and various problems of applied fluid mechanics in natural sciences. Features: Gives comprehensive treatment on fluid dynamics and fluvial process from fundamentals to advanced level applications in one volume. Present knowledge on sediment transport and its interaction with turbulence. Covers recent methodologies on the study of turbulent flow theories with verification of data collected by ADV, PIV, LDA, and imaging techniques. Explores latest empirical formulae for estimation of bed load, saltation and suspension. Contains theory to experimentations with field practices with comprehensive explanations and illustrations with introduction of environmental fluid mechanics. This book is aimed at senior undergraduates, engineering and applied science post graduate and research students working in mechanical, civil and chemical engineering departments pertaining to fluid mechanics, hydraulics, sediment transportation and turbulent flows\"--",

                "The book provides a holistic insight into design research, a comprehensive and cohesive vision of state-of-the-art knowledge about creating and improving quality products, creativity and innovation. Contributions in this volume serve as the illuminating compass for understanding engineering design research, offering a comprehensive perspective on product development, creativity, innovation, invention, and productivity, providing the historical trajectory of design science and exploring the frontiers of engineering design research. The presented educational projects were deployed across EU universities, providing insights for future design courses. Central to the discussions is the pivotal role of sociotechnical dimensions in engineering design, discussing issues of creativity, quality, human-centric methodologies, and the demands of emerging technologies emphasizing their pivotal role in engineering design success. The text offers a panoramic view of design research's current state and critical themes, providing a comprehensive overview for young researchers. Educators and mentors will deepen their knowledge, while experts will refine their methodologies and tools.",

                "First year, undergraduate, mathematics students in Japan have for many years had the opportunity of a unique experience---an introduction, at an elementary level, to some very advanced ideas in mathematics from one of the leading mathematicians of the world. Michio Kuga\u2019s lectures on Group Theory and Differential Equations are a realization of two dreams---one to see Galois groups used to attack the problems of differential equations---the other to do so in such a manner as to take students from a very basic level to an understanding of the heart of this fascinating mathematical problem. From elementary ideas to cartoons to funny examples (considered \"undignified\" by many of his colleagues,) the author provided his students with a book that was considered \"hip\" just to own, to be seen reading, and perhaps to be learning from. Many of his students went on to become good mathematicians, having fallen into the \"crevasse\" of mathematical curiosity. English reading students now have the opportunity to enjoy this lively presentation and to follow the mind of an imaginative and creative mathematician into a world---not really so far removed---of enduring mathematical creations.",

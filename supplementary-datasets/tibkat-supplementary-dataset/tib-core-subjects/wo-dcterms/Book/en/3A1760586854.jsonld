Known for its friendly writing style, student focus, robust problem-solving pedagogy, and engaging health-related applications, the text prepares students for their careers. The text breaks chemical concepts and problem solving into clear, manageable pieces to ensure students stay on track and motivated throughout their first, and often only, chemistry course.   With the newly revised 6th Edition, best-selling author Karen Timberlake and new contributing author MaryKay Orgill connect chemistry to real-world and career applications. Their goal is to help students become critical thinkers by understanding scientific concepts that will form a basis for making important decisions about issues concerning health and the environment and their intended careers.   The new edition introduces more problem-solving strategies, more problem-solving guides, new Analyze the Problem with Connect features, new Try It First and Engage features, conceptual and challenge problems, and new sets of combined problems\u2013all to help students develop the problem-solving skills they\u2019ll need beyond the classroom",

            "abstract": "This book is a collection of chapters on corruption. It highlights the importance of corruption, transparency, and accountability and ways to deal with it. Understanding the types of corruption is very important to know how to deal with it. Types of corruption include bribery, lobbying, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, parochialism, patronage, influence peddling, graft, embezzlement, double-dealing, under-the-table transactions, manipulating elections, diverting funds, laundering money, and defrauding investors. Identifying corruption in all its forms requires analyzing the country and its political system and laws and rooting out the sources of corruption and the people behind it. Corruption and those participating in it must be identified to find ways to deal with it, including installing proper governance mechanisms with complete transparency and accountability for politicians, people in power, and/or citizens, as well as applying rules and holding those who infringe them accountable. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the many types of corruption and how to handle them",

            "abstract": "Fruit production has faced many challenges in recent years as society seeks to increase fruit consumption while increasing safety and reducing the harmful effects of intensive farming practices (e.g., pesticides and fertilizers). In the last 50 years, the population has more than doubled and is expected to grow to 9 billion people by 2050. Per capita consumption of fruit is also increasing during this time and the global fruit industry is facing a major challenge to produce enough fruit in quantity and quality. The need for sustainable production of nutritious food is critical for human and environmental health.This book provides some answers to people who are increasingly concerned about the sustainability of fruit production and the fruit industry as a whole",

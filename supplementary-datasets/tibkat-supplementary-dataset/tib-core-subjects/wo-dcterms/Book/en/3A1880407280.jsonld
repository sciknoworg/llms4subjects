            "abstract": "The book delivers an excellent professional development resource for educators and practitioners on the cutting-edge computational intelligence techniques and applications. It covers many areas and topics of computational intelligence techniques and applications proposed by computational intelligence experts and researchers and furthers the enhancement of the community outreach and engagement component of computational intelligence techniques and applications. Furthermore, it presents a rich collection of manuscripts in highly regarded computational intelligence techniques and applications topics that have been creatively compiled. Computers are capable of learning from data and observations and providing solutions to real-life complex problems, following the same reasoning approach of human experts in various fields. This book endows a rich collection of applications in widespread areas. Among the areas addressed in this book are Computational Intelligence Principles and Techniques; CI in Manufacturing, Engineering, and Industry; CI in Recognition and Processing; CI in Robotics and Automation; CI in Communications and Networking; CI in Traditional Vehicles, Electric Vehicles, and Autonomous Vehicles; CI in Smart Cities and Smart Energy Systems; and CI in Finance, Business, Economics, and Education. These areas span many topics including repetitive manufacturing, discrete manufacturing, process manufacturing, electronic systems, speech recognition, pattern recognition, signal processing, image processing, industrial monitoring, vision systems for automation and robotics, cooperative and network robotics, perception, planning, control, urban traffic networks control, vehicle-to-roadside communications, smart buildings, smart urbanism, smart infrastructure, smart connected communities, smart energy, security, arts, and music.",

                "This open access book is a comprehensive exploration of European hydrogen policy, examining its development at both the EU level and in key Member States, while also considering the geopolitical implications of the emerging hydrogen landscape. The editors begin by framing Europe's position within the global hydrogen economy and present an analytical framework for assessing EU and Member State strategies within this context. The book delves into the evolution of EU hydrogen policy since the launch of its hydrogen strategy in 2020, shedding light on significant developments and how they have been influenced by events like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It then proceeds with in-depth chapters dedicated to key EU Member States and Norway. Each country chapter examines domestic and international hydrogen policies, offering insights into important stakeholder interests, as well as the broader energy and foreign policy considerations shaping the evolving policy landscape. Special attention is given to the international dimension of these strategies, encompassing bilateral and multilateral engagements. In the final chapter, the editors analyze the diverse national strategies and their drivers and discuss their implications for the development of a European hydrogen economy and the role of the EU as a major global player in this market. By examining the variations across Member States, the book provides valuable insights into the factors influencing progress in the hydrogen sector, both in Europe and globally. This book is a resource for policymakers, researchers, and industry professionals seeking a comprehensive understanding of European hydrogen policy and its geopolitical implications. It illuminates the complex dynamics between EU-level strategies and the approaches adopted by individual Member States, ultimately contributing to a broader comprehension of Europe's position within the global hydrogen arena."

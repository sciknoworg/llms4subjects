            "abstract": [
                "This book explains Chester Barnard\u2019s management theory clearly, faithfully, and systematically. When Barnard published The Functions of the Executive in 1938, it caused a paradigm shift in the research area of management. He aimed to clarify what executives should do, and how and why, as he argued that executive functions and processes are deeply related to specialization, incentive, authority and communication, decision making, and responsibility and leadership. Thus, The Functions of the Executive is essential reading for management students. This book serves as an introductory guide for undergraduate and graduate students to help them understand Barnard\u2019s management theory. In addition, the book enables researchers to understand how Barnard developed his theory. He accumulated a great amount of experience in managing diverse organizations in both the private and public sectors. Then he gradually shifted his focus from scalar organizations, authority, and vertical communication to lateral organizations, responsibility, and horizontal communication. Finally, this book offers businesspeople helpful insights to create an innovative style of management. As a practitioner, Barnard recognized not only the importance of science but also that of art and value. Experienced businesspeople use not only formal knowledge but also their behavioral and personal knowledge, intuition, business sense, value, and executive art to understand the whole situation, balance conflicting factors, and produce creative solutions. Thus, this book also explores the management abilities that businesspeople need to develop.",

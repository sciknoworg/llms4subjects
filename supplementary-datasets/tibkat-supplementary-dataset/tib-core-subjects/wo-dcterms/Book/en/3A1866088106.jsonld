            "abstract": "\"This book describes in detail the basic context of the Banach setting and the most important Lie structures found in finite dimension. The authors expose these concepts in the convenient framework which is a common context for projective and direct limits of Banach structures. The book presents sufficient conditions under which these structures exist by passing to such limits. In fact, such limits appear naturally in many mathematical and physical domains. Many examples in various fields illustrate the different concepts introduced. Many geometric structures, existing in the Banach setting, are \"stable\" by passing to projective and direct limits with adequate conditions. The convenient framework is used as a common context for such types of limits. The contents of this book can be considered as an introduction to differential geometry in infinite dimension but also a way for new research topics. This book allows the intended audience to understand the extension to the Banach framework of various topics in finite dimensional differential geometry and, moreover, the properties preserved by passing to projective and direct limits of such structures as a tool in different fields of research. Patrick Cabau is an independent researcher. He received his M. Sc. at the University of Toulouse in 1980, l'Agr\u00e9gation de Math\u00e9matiques in 1987 and his Ph. D. from the University of Savoy in 1999. He has taught at the ENSET (University Nord-Madagascar) and has been a teacher in high schools. His primary current interests are in the areas of differential geometry, mechanics and mathematical Physics. Fernand Pelletier began his career researcher in the University of Burgundy in 1970. He obtained his 3rd cycle doctorate in 1973 and his habilitation in 1980 in this University. Appointed professor at the University of Corsica Pasquale Paoli in 1983, he was transferred to the University of Savoy in 1986. After his retirement in 2010, he has been Professor Emeritus at this University\"--",

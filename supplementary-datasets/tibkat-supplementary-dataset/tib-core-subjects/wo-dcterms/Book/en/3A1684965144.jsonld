                "This open access book outlines key terms of China\u2019s school leadership in Chinese political and legal, financial, administrative, and cultural contexts. It reveals and interprets the real meaning of these practical terms based on existing laws, government documents, school policy texts as well as the latest empirical findings from school leaders and teachers\u2019 surveys and interviews in China. Providing a holistic picture of China\u2019s school leadership through the unique meanings of these terms, the book offers researchers and graduate students insights into school leadership practice and its context in China. Thus, it would likely intensify readers\u2019 knowledge base to analyse and interpret the phenomenon and research data regarding China\u2019s school leadership",

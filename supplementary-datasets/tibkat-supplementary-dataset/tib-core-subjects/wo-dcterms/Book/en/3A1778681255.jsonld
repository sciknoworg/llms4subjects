            "abstract": "In the last few decades, Spectroscopy and its application dramatically diverted science in the direction of brand new era. This book reports on recent progress in spectroscopic technologies, theory and applications of advanced spectroscopy. In this book, we (INTECH publisher, editor and authors) have invested a lot of effort to include 20 most advanced spectroscopy chapters. We would like to invite all spectroscopy scientists to read and share the knowledge and contents of this book. The textbook is written by international scientists with expertise in Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physics, Biology and Nanotechnology many of which are active in research. We hope that the textbook will enhance the knowledge of scientists in the complexities of some spectroscopic approaches; it will stimulate both professionals and students to dedicate part of their future research in understanding relevant mechanisms and applications of chemistry, physics and material sciences",

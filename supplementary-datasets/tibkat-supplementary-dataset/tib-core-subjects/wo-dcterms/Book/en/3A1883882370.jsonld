            "abstract": "An invaluable compendium of up-to-date, real-world vignettes, these detailed depictions are crafted from 35 years of thought leadership and hands-on engagement in U.S. Federal Government proposal development for support services contractors. There is meaningful context built around each vignette, allowing readers to see immediately how to apply the lessons learned. The insights presented are applicable to small businesses and mid-tier companies, as well as global Fortune 50 corporations. Written in a highly accessible style and accompanied by the author\u2070\u0301\u2089s own photographs, On-the-Go! delivers concise, clear-sighted observations and helpful business-driven recommendations. Topics are drawn from actual challenges and situations that organizations and their staff professionals face every proposal. Across the spectrum of vignette topics, attention is paid to multiple dimensions in and around proposal development\u2070\u0301\u2084human and organizational dynamics, linking business decisions to proposal strengths, building the proposal response, proposal writing, and more. In addition, coverage extends to academic and public-sector grant proposals, as well as international private-sector tenders. All the vignettes are easy to use and integrate into an organization's thinking and best practices because they are streamlined. Importantly, On-the-Go! brings practical value to executive leadership, business developers, capture managers, and proposal developers and managers, along with technical and programmatic subject matter experts and knowledge managers",

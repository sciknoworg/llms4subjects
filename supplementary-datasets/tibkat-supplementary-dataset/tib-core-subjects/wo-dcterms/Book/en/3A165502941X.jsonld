                "The nucleus of this volume consists of a number of papers presented at the Advanced Research Workshop on liThe Impact of New Information Technologies on Library Management, Resources and Cooperation\" , held in Luxembourg fran 19-23 November 1984. The oorkshop was a joint effort of four international organisations. The Scientific Affairs Division of the North .Atlantic Treaty Organization, through a personal canmitment and interest expressed by Dr. H. Durand, Assistant Secretary General for Scientific Affairs, was the first and major sponsor acting as a catalyst in enabling the Workshop to take place. Through its support for travel and subsistence costs of some of the North American participants, the Workshop could become a platfo~in for the exchange of ideas between parties concerned with information handling and transmission and information policy in Western Europe and North America. The Directorate General for Information Market and Innovation of the Canmission of the European Communities hosted the Vlorkshop in its facilities - the Jean l'bnnet Building in Luxembourg - also providing for simultaneous translation in the main languages of the European Community. Moreover, the Canmission generously funded the participation of key participants fran Community countries and provided participants with ample info~ination on existing Community programmes related to electronic publications, electronic transmission of documents, copyright problems, problems of standards, telecanmunication, and so on. 'I'he Council of Europe supported attendance fran Sweden, Austria and Spain. And lastly, the European Cultural Foundation organised the event on behalf of all these organisa tions."

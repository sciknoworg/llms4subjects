                "This book is about Big Brother Naija (BBN), which is a Nigerian version of the Big Brother franchise featured in more than 50 countries of the world with its major concept drawn from George Orwell \u2019s novel, Nineteen Eigther-Four . It is organised and starred by Nigerians but viewed in many parts of the world. The book critically engages this relatively new phenomenon in Nigeria which apparently lacks scholarly attention. It proffers insights into the show\u2019s significance and implications for the nation with relation to mental health, morality, cultural diplomacy, diasporic relations, economic diplomacy, law and human relations and power dynamics. Christopher Isike is a professor of African Politics and International Relations at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. Olusola Ogunnubi is an adjunct research fellow with Carleton University, Canada and also affiliated with the University of the Free State, South Africa. Ogochukwu Ukwueze works in English and Literary Studies, University of Nigeria, Nsukka where he assists in teaching and research."

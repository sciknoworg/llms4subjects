            "abstract": "*Weitere Angaben Verfasser: The present paper on \"Environmental Education\" draws upon the results of the study \"Environmental Education for Children and Youth\". The project was jointly undertaken by the public relations consultancy iserundschmidt (Bad Honnef & Berlin, project-coordination) and the research institutes UfU (Independent Institute for Environmental Concerns, Berlin) and IZT (Institute for Futures Studies and Technology Assessment, Berlin) from September 2003 till February 2005. The research project was commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. Its aim was to test a model campaign targeting schools, the research and analysis of teaching-materials on Renewable Energies and the conceptualisation of new options to further environmental education for children and youth. The model-campaign took place at 32 schools in the form of discussions-forums. Each forum consisted of a short talk by an expert, a discussion amongst the pupils, the choice of and comments on a collection of viewpoint t-shirts and a questionnaire on the pupils' knowledge and attitude towards renewable energies. The analysis of teaching-materials provides support to active stakeholders and teacher in environmental education. Circa 300 different teaching-materials on renewable energies (books, brochures, sets of experiments, videos, CD-Roms and internet-resources) were sampled and analysed. 70 most-suited teaching materials were taken out of the multitude and described extensively. Suggestions for the reduction of deficits in environmental education were drawn up on the basis of interviews with experts and the analysis of existing teaching materials",

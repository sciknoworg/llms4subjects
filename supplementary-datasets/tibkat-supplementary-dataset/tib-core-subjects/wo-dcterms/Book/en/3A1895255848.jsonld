            "abstract": "Within the project WEA-Acceptance\u00b9, extensive measurement campaigns were carried out, which included the recording of acoustic, meteorological and turbine-specific data. Acoustic quantities were measured at several distances to the wind turbine and under various atmospheric and turbine conditions. In the project WEA-Acceptance-Data\u00b2, the acquired measurements are stored in a structured and anonymized form and provided for research purposes. Besides the data and its documentation, first evaluations as well as reference data sets for chosen scenarios are published. In this version of the data platform, a specification 2.0, an anonymized data set and three use cases are published. The specification contains the concept of the data platform, which is primarily based on the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principle. The data set consists of turbine-specific, meteorological and acoustic data recorded over one month. Herein, the data were corrected, conditioned and anonymized so that relevant outliers are marked and erroneous data are removed in the data set. The acoustic data includes anonymized sound pressure levels and one-third octave spectra averaged over ten minutes as well as audio data. In addition, the metadata and an overview of data availability are uploaded. As examples for the application of the data, three use cases are also published. Important information such as the approach for data anonymization is briefly described in the ReadMe file.",

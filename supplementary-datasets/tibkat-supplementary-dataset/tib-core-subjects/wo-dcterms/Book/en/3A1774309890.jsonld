            "abstract": "Eugene R. Black, President of the World Bank, presented the Annual Report of the World Bank, which tells a story of how peoples and governments in many underdeveloped countries are beginning to work out the complicated problems of economic development and beginning to reap the rewards of their efforts. This was a year of more activity than anytime previously. Bank lending amounted to USD 711 million or over 75 percent more than the average of the previous three years. This marked increase promises to be sustained in the present year. In August, the Bank's bond issue was oversubscribed, and place entirely outside the United States. The Federal Republic of Germany has played an increasing role as a supplier of development capital. Black urged again for the release of restrictions on the use of member capital subscriptions. The Bank played a role as mediator in the dispute over the Suez Canal. Bank advisory services expanded; resident representatives now work in nine countries. The lack of suitable projects remains the main limitation to expanding operations, but this may soon no longer be the case. Proposals are under review for regional development institutions in Latin America and the Middle East. A weighty responsibility rests on the shoulders of every government that is a recipient of external assistance to create conditions where its capital can be invested wisely and productively",

                "How do the films of Kubrick communicate mental events of characters in a purely visual manner? And how does the music in his films express meaning when music in essence is an abstract and non-representational art form? Drawing on state-of-the-art discoveries within embodied cognitive science, this book sets out to address these and other questions by revealing Kubrick as a genuine artist of embodied meaning-making, a filmmaker who perhaps more than any other director, uses all the resources of filmmaking in such a controlled and dense manner as to elicit the embodied tools necessary to achieve a level of conceptual clarity"

                "\"Is computing just for men? Are men and women suited to different careers? This collection of global perspectives challenges these commonly held western views, perpetuated as explanations for women's low participation in computing. By providing an insider look at how different cultures worldwide impact the experiences of women in computing, the book introduces readers to theories and evidence that support the need to turn to environmental factors, rather than innate potential, to understand what determines women's participation in this growing field. This wakeup call to examine the obstacles and catalysts within various cultures and environments will help those interested in improving the situation understand where they might look to make changes that could impact women's participation in their classrooms, companies, and administrations. Computer scientists, STEM educators, students of all disciplines, professionals in the tech industry, leaders in gender equity, anthropologists, and policy makers will all benefit from reading this book. Dr. Carol Frieze works on diversity and inclusion in Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science. She focuses on culture and broadening participation in computing. She is co-author of Kicking Butt in Computer Science: Women in Computing at Carnegie Mellon University (2015). Frieze is winner of the 2016 AccessComputing Capacity Building Award and the 2017 winner of the Computing Research Association's A. Nico Habermann Award. Dr. Jeria L. Quesenberry is an associate teaching professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University. Her research interests include cultural influences on IT students and professionals, social inclusion, and broadening participation. She is co-author of Kicking Butt in Computer Science\"--"

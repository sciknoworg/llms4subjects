                "This book contains the proceedings of a workshop, 'Statistical Methods for the Assess\u00ad ment of Point Source Pollution', held September 12-14, 1988, at the Canada Centre for Inland Waters in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. The objectives of the workshop were to: a) advance the art, science, and application of statistical methods to current water quality issues by stimulating discussions and disseminating ideas and information. The emphasis was on statistical problems associated with monitor\u00ad ing and controlling discharges from industries and municipalities and assessing the impact of these discharges on receiving water quality, b) provide a forum for managers, engineers, scientists, and statisticians to present and discuss techniques for evaluating water quality data and planning monitoring activities, c) provide a published state-of-the art summary of the application of statistical methods for the assessment of point source discharges and their impact on water qUality. The papers contained in this volume cover a number of topics that are of concern not only for monitoring and assessing point source pollution but also for other environmental problems."

            "abstract": "\"In this, the second edition, I think there's still more to be said and more to be learned. The field of lighting design is at an inflexion point and, while it may last a while, I think on the other side of it we'll all need to be able to understand and solve a new set of challenges. We're no longer focused on task illuminance as a key goal, for example. Task illuminance is so well understood, and so easy to achieve that it's become a secondary or tertiary concern. We've also moved past energy conservation. Yes, our designs need to meet energy conservation codes, and many of us are looking at net zero goals, but meeting energy conservation requirements is no longer the challenge it was when we were using incandescent and fluorescent light sources in our designs. Aesthetics will continue to be a large part of what we do, but advances in LEDs will change some of how we do it. From my perspective, the lighting design challenges students' need to be prepared for include a fuller and more nuanced understanding of color rendering, the broadening use of colored LEDs and the associated need to understand color science, the impact of light on health and wellness, which includes circadian entrainment but is starting to go beyond that and encompass other areas as well, and UV-C disinfection. All of these topics require science to inform them, understanding of science to apply them, and evidence-based guides to ensure that they are being implemented effectively and safely. The world is asking more of lighting designers (without a commensurate increase in fees, unfortunately), and I see more and more designers layering these subjects on top of the traditional foundation of illuminance, aesthetics, and energy efficiency\"--",

                "This book presents peer-reviewed articles and recent advances on the potential applications of Science and Mathematics for future technologies, from the 7th International Conference on the Applications of Science and Mathematics (SCIEMATHIC 2021), held in Malaysia. It provides an insight about the leading trends in sustainable Science and Technology. The world is looking for sustainable solutions to problems more than ever. The synergistic approach of mathematicians, scientists and engineers has undeniable importance for future technologies. With this viewpoint, SCIEMATHIC 2021 has the theme \u201cQuest for Sustainable Science and Mathematics for Future Technologies\u201d. The conference brings together physicists, mathematicians, statisticians and data scientists, providing a platform to find sustainable solutions to major problems around us. The works presented here are suitable for professionals and researchers globally in making the world a better and sustainable place.",

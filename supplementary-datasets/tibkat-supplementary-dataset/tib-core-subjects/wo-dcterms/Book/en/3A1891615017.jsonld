            "abstract": "Londoners Making London tells the story of nine projects that have transformed urban neighbourhoods. Countering the expectation that the development of cities is exclusively controlled by architects, planners and developers, this book demonstrates that transformational change is increasingly driven by communities. In areas such as Wandsworth, Shoreditch and Wood Green, young and old can be seen working together with determination, conviction and often against all odds to create better places to live, learn and play. Colourful street parties, co-housing, new libraries, urban food gardens and local enterprise spaces all illustrate what can be done when people work together. In-depth interviews with instigators, community activists, campaigners and self-builders illuminate the projects. Their stories candidly reveal challenges, share moments of triumph and provide insight into how we might scale up the impact of grass-roots urbanism. For anyone seeking to change their community for the better, Londoners Making London offers the tools and inspiration to turn passion into action",

            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Additives in Water-borne Coatings covers both current technology and the future prognosis for the key additives used in water-borne coatings today. It brings together international expertise to provide a comprehensive, practical overview of the field, its direction, and selection of key additives currently employed for in-depth treatment of their use, behaviour and scope by expert practitioners in those additives. This timely publication includes two excellent plenary chapters reviewing the developments together with the regulatory and legislative scene in the overall field. It also contains seven in-depth chapters devoted to key additive types, specifically; rheology modifiers, matting agents, surface active agents, dispersants, defoamers, and biocides.  In addition, the book provides: * a systematic approach to additive selection - additive rules - for the development of a coating * a good understanding of the biocidal degradation effects and the key biocide strengths and weaknesses in addressing them * the reader with a thorough understanding of silica-based matting agents and their mode of action * useful overviews of water borne dispersants, silicone surface active agents and cellulosic and associative thickener rheology modifiers This key book amalgamates some of the latest developments in this field and provides an authoritative source of information for the research community and those in the industry, as well as providing invaluable information to graduate and postgraduate students",

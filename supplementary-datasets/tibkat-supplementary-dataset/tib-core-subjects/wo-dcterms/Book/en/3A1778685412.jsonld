            "abstract": "Almost 30 years have gone by since the postulation that GISTs derive from mesenchymal stem elements, and only 15 years have gone by since the definitive detection of origin of GISTs. Research in the last decade was more focused upon the justification of imatinib mezylate therapy in GISTs and clarification why a secondary resistance that occurred during the kinase inhibitors therapy. The era of therapy for GISTs, targeting the primary activating mutations in the KIT proto-oncogene; is being proclaimed as bringing the message of special importance to the pathologist role in multidisciplinary team that are responsible for treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic GIST. This is the first conclusive message forthcoming from this book. On the other hand, the book provides summarised and case-based knowledge on current management of gastrointestinal and extragastrointestinal stromal tumours. We hope that this book may be considered as a worthwhile timely addition to clinical science dissemination, medical education, further basic and clinical research",

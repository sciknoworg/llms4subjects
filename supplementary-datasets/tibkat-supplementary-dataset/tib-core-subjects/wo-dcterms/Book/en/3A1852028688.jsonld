            "abstract": "\"This book focuses on spearheading the integration of maintainability and sustainable facility management right from the planning & design stage. It introduces the concept of green maintainability and discusses considerations to maximize the performance; resource and energy efficiency, while minimizing a facility's total life cycle cost; embodied energy; carbon emission; environmental impact and consumption of matter/energy throughout its life cycle by \"doing it right the first time\". In this edition, the latest relevant codes of practices, regulations and standards are included. All chapters have been brought up to date to include contemporary sustainability concerns, such as sustainability design, construction and materials, and maintainability of green features. A new chapter on \"Common Areas\" has been added. Every chapter is summarized with an easy-to-use table to make the book more practical and user-friendly. Maintainability of Facilities is written for practitioners and students in architecture, engineering, building, real estate, construction, project management, facilities management, quantity and building surveying\"--",

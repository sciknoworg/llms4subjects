            "abstract": "\"Print and Specifications Reading for Construction is a comprehensive manual on how to interpret construction documents. Other books solely cover print reading and miss the important construction specifications, which can be quite complicated for commercial building projects. This book covers the graphic and written sets and demonstrates how they related to each other. Incorporating the relevant terminology and practical applications of sustainability and BIM, this book explains the most current ways construction documents communicate information. Complete sets of construction documents for three actual building projects are available on the book companion website, and there are practice questions and exercises throughout the text making this book an ideal resource for use in construction courses. This Updated Edition includes updates to include the use of schematics as a drawing category, an update to the Structural category with a better description of the soils report and a clearer illustrated description of various structural members, as well as various clerical and spelling changes.\"--",

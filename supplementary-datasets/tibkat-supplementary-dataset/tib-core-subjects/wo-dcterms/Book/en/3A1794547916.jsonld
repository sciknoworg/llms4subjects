            "abstract": "There are several types of training methods aiming to develop sports performance and improve health indicators. Fundamentally, training methods are the result of manipulating different training variables, and the possibility of combining these variables is vast. Therefore, the search to study the effect of these constraints on sports and health, considering specific contexts and taking into account the magnitude of inter-individual responses, will afford a better understanding of the training interventions.At the same time, over the years, numerous innovations and technological advances have been introduced to assist the development of athletes\u2019 performance and monitor individual lifestyles. These advances have changed how training may be conducted, controlled, and evaluated. For example, in sport settings, using technology to collect many and continuous data of athletes\u2019 activity in their natural environments appears as an innovative and promising step. In health, an enormous diversity of training methods supporting healthy lifestyles and innovative approaches is arising, especially from higher-quality information gathered through technological development.Papers addressing these topics are included in this book, especially those combining a high academic standard with a practical focus on providing knowledge on how training methods improve sports performance and health across people's lifespans. New evidence urges us to track the progress and effects of training methods",

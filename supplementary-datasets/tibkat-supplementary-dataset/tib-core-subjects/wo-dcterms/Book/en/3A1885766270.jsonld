            "abstract": "Genetic criticism investigates creative processes by analysing manuscripts and other archival sources. It sheds light on authors\u2019 working practices and the ways works are developed on the writer\u2019s desk or in the artist\u2019s studio. This book provides a cross-section of current international trends in genetic criticism, half a century after the birth of the discipline in Paris. The last two decades have witnessed an expansion of the field of study with new kinds of research objects and new forms of archival material, along with various kinds of interdisciplinary intersections and new theoretical perspectives. The essays in this volume represent various European literary and scholarly traditions discussing creative processes from Polish poetry to French children\u2019s literature, as well as topical issues such as born-digital literature and the application of forensic methodology to manuscript studies. The book is intended for scholars and students of literary criticism and textual scholarship, together with anyone interested in the working practices of writers, illustrators, and editors",

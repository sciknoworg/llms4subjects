            "abstract": "The importance of mathematics in the study of problems arising from the real world, and the increasing success with which it has been used to model situations ranging from the purely deterministic to the stochastic, in all areas of today's Physical Sciences and Engineering, is well established. The purpose of the sets of volumes, the present one being the first in a planned series of sequential sets, is to make available authoritative, up to date, and self-contained accounts of some of the most important and useful of these analytical approaches and techniques. Each volume in each set will provide a detailed introduction to a specific subject area of current importance, and then goes beyond this by reviewing recent contributions, thereby serving as a valuable reference source. The progress in applicable mathematics has been brought about by the extension and development of many important analytical approaches and techniques, in areas both old and new, frequently aided by the use of computers without which the solution of realistic problems in modern Physical Sciences and Engineering would otherwise have been impossible. A case in point is the analytical technique of singular perturbation theory (Volume 3), which has a long history. In recent years it has been used in many different ways, and its importance has been enhanced by its having been used in various fields to derive sequences of asymptotic approximations, each with a higher order of accuracy than its predecessor. These approximations have, in turn, provided a better understanding of the subject and stimulated the development of new methods for the numerical solution of the higher order approximations. A typical example of this type is to be found in the general study of nonlinear wave propagation phenomena as typified by the study of water waves. Elsewhere, as with the identification and emergence of the study of inverse problems (volumes 1 and 2), new analytical approaches have stimulated the development of numerical techniques for the solution of this major class of problems. Such work divides naturally into two parts, the first being the identification and formulation of inverse problems, the theory of ill-posed problems and the class of one-dimensional inverse problems, and the second being the study and theory of multidimensional inverse problems. Volume 1: Inverse Problems 1 Volume 2: Inverse Problems 2 Alexander G. Ramm, Author These volumes present the theory of inverse spectral and scatte ...",

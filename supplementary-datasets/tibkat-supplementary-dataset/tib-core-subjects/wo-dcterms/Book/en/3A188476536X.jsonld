            "abstract": "\"Plants are continuously exposed to different environmental stresses which negatively impact their physiology and morphology resulting in production reduction. As a result of constant pressure plants evolve different mechanisms for sustenance and survival. Hormones play a major role in defences against these stresses and stimulate regulatory mechanisms. One of the ways through which they mitigate stress is via the production of hormones like auxins, ethylene, jasmonic acid etc. The phytohormones help in signalling and enhance the chances of survival of plants. Plant hormones play many vital roles from integrating developmental events, and physiological and biochemical processes to mediating in both abiotic and biotic stresses. This book aims to highlight these issues and provide scope for the development of resistance in crops against abiotic stresses to maximize yield for the growing population. There is an urgent need for the development of strategies, methods, and tools for the broad-spectrum resistance in plants supporting sustainable crop production under hostile environmental conditions. The salient features: \u00c2\u00b7 It includes both traditional and non-traditional phytohormones and focuses on the latest progress emphasizing the roles of different hormones under abiotic stresses. It provides a scope of the best plausible and suitable options for overcoming these stresses and puts forward the methods for crop improvement. It is an amalgamation of the biosynthesis of phytohormones and also provides molecular intricacies and signaling mechanisms in different abiotic stresses. \u00c2\u00b7 This book serves as a reference book for scientific investigators from recent graduates, academicians and researchers working on phytohormones and abiotic stresses\"--",

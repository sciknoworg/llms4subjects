The farm, based in Santa Ynez, California, works with breeders from around the world to bring new rosebushes to American gardeners, and harvests their own spectacular roses for weddings, events, and local flower lovers. They've also grown a nationwide online business that delivers roses to customers around the country. In this book, Poulson shares her incredible breadth of wisdom in a comprehensive guide to growing roses specifically to use as cut flowers. It includes detailed information on 100 of the best varieties in every possible hue--ones that can thrive in the home garden and bring gardeners magnificent blooms year after year. She also offers instructions for planting, year-round care, and harvesting, whether you're growing roses in the ground, in raised beds, or in containers, and in every climate zone; plus styling and arranging tips, including bouquets in simple pitchers and urns as well as more elaborate tablescapes and floral arches\"--",

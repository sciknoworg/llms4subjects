                "This book presents the state-of-the-art in the emerging field of data science and includes models for layered security with applications in the protection of sites\u2014such as large gathering places\u2014through high-stake decision-making tasks. Such tasks include cancer diagnostics, self-driving cars, and others where wrong decisions can possibly have catastrophic consequences. Additionally, this book provides readers with automated methods to analyze patterns and models for various types of data, with applications ranging from scientific discovery to business intelligence and analytics. The book primarily includes exploratory data analysis, pattern mining, clustering, and classification supported by real life case studies. The statistical section of this book explores the impact of data mining and modeling on the predictability assessment of time series. Further new notions of mean values based on ideas of multi-criteria optimization are compared with their conventional definitions, leading to new algorithmic approaches to the calculation of the suggested new means. The style of the written chapters and the provision of a broad yet in-depth overview of data mining, integrating novel concepts from machine learning and statistics, make the book accessible to upper level undergraduate and graduate students in data mining courses. Students and professionals specializing in computer and management science, data mining for high-dimensional data, complex graphs and networks will benefit from the cutting-edge ideas and practically motivated case studies in this book.",

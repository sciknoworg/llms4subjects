In an age of viruses and hackers, electronic eavesdropping, and electronic fraud on a global scale, security is paramount. The purpose of this book is to provide a practical survey of both the principles and practice of cryptography and network security. In the first part of the book, the basic issues to be addressed by a network security capability are explored by providing a tutorial and survey of cryptography and network security technology. The latter part of the book deals with the practice of network security: practical applications that have been implemented and are in use to provide network security. The Seventh Edition streamlines subject matter with new and updated material \u2014 including Sage, one of the most important features of the book. Sage is an open-source, multiplatform, freeware package that implements a very powerful, flexible, and easily learned mathematics and computer algebra system. It provides hands-on experience with cryptographic algorithms and supporting homework assignments. With Sage, students learn a powerful tool that can be used for virtually any mathematical application. The book also provides an unparalleled degree of support for instructors and students to ensure a successful teaching and learning experience.",

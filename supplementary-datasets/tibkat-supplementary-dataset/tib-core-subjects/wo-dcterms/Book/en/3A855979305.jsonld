This resource blends quantitative and business perspectives to provide an in-depth understanding of the derivative risk management skills that are necessary to adopt in the competitive financial industry.

Explore the fundamental components of the derivatives business, including equity derivatives, interest rates derivatives, real estate derivatives, and real life derivatives, etc. Examine the life cycle of manufacturing derivative products and practical pricing models Deep dive into a wide range of customer-driven structured derivative products, their investment or hedging payoff features and associated risk exposures Examine the implications of changing regulatory standards, which can increase costs in the banking sector Discover practical yet sophisticated product analysis, quantitative modeling, infrastructure integration, risk analysis, and hedging analysis Gain insight on how banks should handle complex derivatives products Manufacturing and Managing Customer-Driven Derivatives is an essential guide for quants, structurers, derivatives traders, risk managers, business executives, insurance industry professionals, hedge fund managers, academic lecturers, and financial math students who are interested in looking at the bigger picture of the manufacturing, pricing and risk management process of customer-driven derivative transactions\"--",

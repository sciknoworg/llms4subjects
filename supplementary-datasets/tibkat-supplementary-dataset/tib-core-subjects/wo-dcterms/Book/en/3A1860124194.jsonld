            "abstract": "This open access book draws on ethnographic research conducted in empowerment programmes for marginalized women, in the Southeast Anatolia region, to understand how these projects operate and why they have failed. Based on interviews and observations, the book argues that everyday barriers in Turkey's 'gendered regime' still impede women's potential, and that the programmes' own feminist agendas are undermined through their capitalist ethos of personal growth and culturalist reasoning. Particularly revealing is the state's large-scale regional development project, the 'Southeast Anatolia Project', which is the priortiy and ultimately facilitates women's structural exclusion. Situating the ongoing empowerment programmes within the larger social engineering project of the Republic of Turkey - which is long associated with emancipating women through top-down measures - this book highlights the repetition of failure in women's liberation in the history of the country.

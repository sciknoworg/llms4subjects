            "title": "Compressive Strength of Concrete",
            "abstract": "Concrete made using mineral cements, the raw materials which on earth are practically endless, is known as one of the oldest building materials and during the last decades of the twentieth century has become a dominant building material for general use. At the same time, the requirements of the quality of concrete and its performance properties, in particular compressive strength, durability, economical efficiency, and low negative impact of its manufacture on the environment have not yet been completely met. Bearing these requirements in mind, researchers and engineers worldwide are working on how to satisfy these requirements. This book has been written by researchers and experts in the field and provides the state of the art on recent progress achieved on the properties of concrete, including concrete in which industrial by-products are utilized. The book is dedicated to graduate students, researchers, and practicing engineers in related fields",

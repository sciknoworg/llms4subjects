            "abstract": "Excel has become an important and nearly ubiquitous classroom and office resource for students and practitioners who are faced with solving statistical problems on an everyday basis. Despite this, there has yet to emerge a truly practical, 'how-do-I-do-it' manual that teaches the various applications and processes/formulas for Excel  in educational and psychological Statistics. Quirk's Excel 2010 for Educational and Psychological Statistics will fill this void, as it is designed to be a step-by-step, exercise-driven guide for education and psychology students who need to master Excel to create  formulas and solve statistical problems.    Each chapter first explains briefly the formulas that are included in the chapter, and then directs the student on  how to use Excel commands and formulas to solve a specific business problem.  Three practice problems are provided at the end of each chapter, along with their solutions in an Appendix.  At the end of the Excel Guide, an additional Practice Exam allows the reader to test his or her understanding of each chapter by attempting to solve a specific educational or psychometrical issue or problem using Excel (the solution to this problem is also given in an Appendix).  From the beginning of the book, readers/students are taught how to write their own formulas and then how to utilize Excel drop-down formula menus as well for such exercises involving one-way ANOVA, simple linear regression, and multiple correlation.'    At the beginning of his academic career, Prof. Quirk spent six years in educational research at The American Institutes for Research and Educational Testing Service.  He then taught Social Psychology, Educational Psychology, and General Psychology at Principia College, and is currently a Professor of Marketing in the George Herbert Walker School of Business  Technology at Webster University based in St. Louis, Missouri (USA) where he teaches Marketing Statistics, Marketing Research, and Pricing Strategies.  He has published articles in the Journal of Educational Psychology, Journal of Educational Research, Review of Educational Research, Journal of Educational Measurement, Educational Technology, The Elementary School Journal, Journal of Secondary Education, Educational Horizons, and Phi Delta Kappan.  In addition, he has written 60+ textbook supplements in Marketing and Management, published 20+ articles in professional journals, and presented 20+ papers at professional meetings, including annual meetings of The American Educational Research Association, The American Psychological Association, and the National Council on Measurement in Education.  He holds a B.S. in Mathematics from John Carroll University, both an M.A. in Education and a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from Stanford University, and an M.B.A. from The University of Missouri-St. Louis.",

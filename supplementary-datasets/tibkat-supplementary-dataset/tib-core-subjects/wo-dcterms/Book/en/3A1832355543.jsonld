            "abstract": "The major aims of this book, \"Watershed Water Environment and Hydrology under the Influence of Anthropogenic and Natural Processes\", are to focus on innovative/new ideas on the watershed water environment from different perspectives across the field; distinguish the evolution of watershed water ecological and environmental quality; clarify the biogeochemical cycling of elements or pollutants; identify and quantify the sources of pollutants; and assess the ecological risk and human health risk of pollutants in the water environment at different watershed scales. In particular, eight peer-reviewed articles were collected, mainly reporting the hydrochemistry-based watershed weathering processes and their environmental implications, trace elements and their risks, and the nutrients cycle in river-reservoir systems. Overall, these papers contribute to several aspects of the watershed water environment and are valuable for river water resource protection and management",

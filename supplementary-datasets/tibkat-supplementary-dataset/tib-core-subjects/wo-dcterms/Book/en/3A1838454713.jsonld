            "abstract": "Insightful and cutting-edge discussions of recent developments in human-machine systemsIn Handbook of Human-Machine Systems, a team of distinguished researchers delivers a comprehensive exploration of human-machine systems (HMS) research and development from a variety of illuminating perspectives. The book offers a big picture look at state-of-the-art research and technology in the area of HMS. Contributing authors cover Brain-Machine Interfaces and Systems, including assistive technologies like devices used to improve locomotion. They also discuss advances in the scientific and engineering foundations of Collaborative Intelligent Systems and Applications.Companion technology, which combines trans-disciplinary research in fields like computer science, AI, and cognitive science, is explored alongside the applications of human cognition in intelligent and artificially intelligent system designs, human factors engineering, and various aspects of interactive and wearable computers and systems. The book also includes:_ A thorough introduction to human-machine systems via the use of emblematic use cases, as well as discussions of potential future research challenges_ Comprehensive explorations of hybrid technologies, which focus on transversal aspects of human-machine systems_ Practical discussions of human-machine cooperation principles and methods for the design and evaluation of a brain-computer interfacePerfect for academic and technical researchers with an interest in HMS, Handbook of Human-Machine Systems will also earn a place in the libraries of technical professionals practicing in areas including computer science, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, engineering, psychology, and neurobiology",

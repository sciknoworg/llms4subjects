            "abstract": "Revolution Beyond the Event brings together leading international anthropologists alongside emerging  scholars to examine revolutionary legacies from the MENA region, Latin America  and the Caribbean. It explores the idea that revolutions have varied afterlives  that complicate the assumptions about  their duration, pace and progression, and argues that a renewed focus on the  temporality of radical politics is essential to our understanding of  revolution. Approaching revolution through its relationship to time, the book  is a critical intervention into attempts to define revolutions as bounded events  that act as sequential transitions from one political system to another. It pursues  an ethnographically driven rethinking of the temporal horizons that are at  stake in revolutionary processes, arguing that linear views of revolution are inextricably  tied to notions of progress and modernity. Through a careful selection of case studies,  the book provides a critical perspective on the lived realities of  revolutionary afterlives, challenging the liberal humanist assumptions implicit  in the \u2018modern\u2019 idea of revolution, and reappraising the political agency of  people caught up in revolutionary situations across a variety of ethnographic  contexts",

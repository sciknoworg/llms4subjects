                "This multidisciplinary reference explores the concepts and realities of quality of life among cancer survivors in its physical, psychological, cognitive, social, and familial dimensions. Informed by a broad range of fields including genetics, psychiatry, nursing, dentistry, rehabilitation, and ethics, it addresses daily challenges of living for this population, from self-care to cultural concerns and from social interactions to experiences with providers. Family issues of pediatric, young adult, and elder survivors, caregiving parents, and siblings are a major area of concern. And contributors describe interventions for survivors as individuals, in family content, and as part of integrated care across primary and specialty settings. Included among the topics: Play, leisure activities, and cognitive health among older cancer survivors. Genetic mutations in cancer susceptibility genes: a family history of cancer. Cancer patients in a pediatric intensive care unit: a single center experience. The impact of childhood cancer on the quality of life among healthy siblings. When cancer returns: family caregivers and the hospice team. Experiencing cancer services: a story of survival and dissatisfaction. A significant addition to the cancer survivorship literature, Quality of Life Among Cancer Survivors is a practice-building resource for oncology and allied health professionals, health psychologists, and social workers, as well as researchers in these fields.",

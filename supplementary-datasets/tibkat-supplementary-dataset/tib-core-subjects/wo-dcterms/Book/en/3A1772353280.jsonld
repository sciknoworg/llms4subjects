            "abstract": "\"This book demonstrates how to formulate the equations of mechanical systems. Providing methods of analysis of complex mechanical systems, the book has a clear focus on efficiency, equipping the reader with knowledge of algorithms that provide accurate results in reduced simulation time. The book uses Kane's method due to its efficiency, and the simple resulting equations it produces in comparison to other methods and extends it with algorithms such as order-n. Kane's method compensates for the errors of premature linearization, which are often inherent within vibrations modes found in a great deal of public domain software. Describing how to build mathematical models of multibody systems with elastic components, the book applies this to systems such as construction cranes, trailers, helicopters, spacecraft, tethered satellites, and underwater vehicles. It also looks at topics such as vibration, rocket dynamics, simulation of beams, deflection, and matrix formulation. Flexible Multibody Dynamics will be of interest to students in mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, applied mechanics and dynamics. It will also be of interest to industry professionals in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering and construction engineering\"--",

            "abstract": "Climate change mitigation and adaptation are key challenges of the 21st century. These challenges include global energy consumption and dependence on fossil fuels, which are addressed in global energy policies. About two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions are linked to the burning of fossil fuels used for heating, electricity, transport, and industry. Therefore, the world is looking for the most reliable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly energy sources coupled with energy saving, which is a clean and low-cost solution to the growing demand for energy. As a clear example of this, cities are integrating renewable energies into their smart city plans. This book aims to advance the contribution of the use of renewable energies and energy saving in order to achieve a more sustainable world",

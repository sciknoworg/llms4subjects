                "\"This book examines the ways in which well being affects educational outcomes. Using an ecological approach, the book defines what we mean by well being and resilience in education and how this relates to policy and children and young people's rights. The book considers strategies utilised by the education, health, voluntary and private sectors which promote well being and resilience for children and young people from the early years to adulthood. This book also explores societal factors such as poverty and family well being. Childhood Well being and Resilience goes on to provide examples of practice interventions inside and outside the classroom. It represents a sea change in professional approaches to well being and resilience as protective factors against poor mental health. It includes chapters on key topics such as: The concept of child well being, resilience and the rights of the child; peer interaction and well being; social media and mental health; well being and outdoor learning; mindfulness for young children; international policy and child well being. This book supports professionals to increase their knowledge, establish a skill set and build their confidence which can enable children and young people to develop good levels of well being and to improve their resilience. Including reflective questions and case studies, Childhood Well being and Resilience is essential reading for undergraduate students studying Early Childhood Studies, Education Studies, Teaching Awards and Family and Community Studies\"--"

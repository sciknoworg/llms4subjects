            "abstract": "\"Providing an in-depth and cutting-edge investigation into the rise of Asian research practices and paradigms, Mats Benner examines how this rise has been accomplished, what effects it has had, and how it has shaped universities across seven Asian countries. Broad and comprehensive, chapters analyse the research and education systems of China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Macau, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, considering how their universities operate, their models and policy priorities. Benner studies the historical, social and political causes behind the variations between these countries, before highlighting the effects of globalization on education, research and innovation. Assessing whether we are witnessing a tectonic shift in how and where education and research are carried out, the book ultimately concludes that regional disparities will remain, but that practices and priorities are becoming increasingly similar in the process of globalization. With Asia showing an increasingly marked presence in research and in scientific and technological capability, this timely book will be invaluable to university policy makers looking to innovate their education and research models, alongside students and scholars interested in Asian development, innovation and technology\"--",

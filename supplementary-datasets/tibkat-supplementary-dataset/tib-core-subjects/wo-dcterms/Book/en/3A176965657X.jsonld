            "abstract": "This book expands on the subject matter of \u2019Computational Electromagnetics and Model-Based Inversion: A Modern Paradigm for Eddy-Current Nondestructive Evaluation.\u2019 It includes (a) voxel-based inversion methods, which are generalizations of model-based algorithms; (b) a complete electromagnetic model of advanced composites (and other novel exotic materials), stressing the highly anisotropic nature of these materials, as well as giving a number of applications to nondestructive evaluation; and (c) an up-to-date discussion of stochastic integral equations and propagation-of-uncertainty models in nondestructive evaluation. As such, the book combines research started twenty-five years ago in advanced composites and voxel-based algorithms, but published in scattered journal articles, as well as recent research in stochastic integral equations. All of these areas are of considerable interest to the aerospace, nuclear power, civil infrastructure, materials characterization and biomedical industries. The book covers the topic of computational electromagnetics in eddy-current nondestructive evaluation (NDE) by emphasizing three distinct topics: (a) fundamental mathematical principles of volume-integral equations as a subset of computational electromagnetics, (b) mathematical algorithms applied to signal-processing and inverse scattering problems, and (c) applications of these two topics to problems in which real and model data are used. It is therefore more than an academic exercise and is valuable to users of eddy-current NDE technology in industries as varied as nuclear power, aerospace, materials characterization and biomedical imaging.",

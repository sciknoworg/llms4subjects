            "abstract": "This data publication contains the materials, the raw data, relevant processed data and analysis of a german-wide, representative survey on river landscapes. The survey was designed by the Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Institute of Environmental Planning. It was conducted by the Ersult GmbH (G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) in early 2018. The main element of the survey was a choice experiment, where participants should decide between different scenarios of river restoration. We concentrated on the key element large wood and its benefits regarding ecosystem services and people. For this, we offered ecosystem service-related information in addition to the choice attributes. The choice experiment was performed by three different sub-samples (groups). Group 1 only received ordinally-scaled qualitative information, group 2 cardinally-scaled quantifications and group 3 monetary information [\u20ac]. The survey is part of the research and restoration project Wilde Mulde - Revitalization of a wild river landscape in central Germany (WilMu) (https://wilde-mulde.de/en/ and https://www.umwelt.uni-hannover.de/de/forschungsprojekte/forschungsprojekt-detailansicht/projects/revitalizing-river-landscapes-assessment-and-evaluation-of-ecosystem-services-and-the-importance-o/) The \u201cWilde Mulde\u201d project is jointly funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) with funds also from the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) in Germany (funding code: 01LC1322F). The BMBF is funding this project as an Initiative for Sustainable Development (FONA): www.fona.de",

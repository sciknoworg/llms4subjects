            "title": "Citrus - Health Benefits and Production Technology",
            "abstract": "Citrus is one of the world's major fruit crops, with global availability and popularity contributing to human diets. Citrus fruits are the highest-value fruit crop in terms of international trade. Current annual worldwide citrus production is estimated at over 70 million tons, with more than half of this being oranges. The rise in citrus production is mainly due to the increase in cultivation areas, improvements in transportation and packaging, rising incomes, and consumer preference for healthy foods. Citrus fruit growth and quality are dependent on climatic conditions, in addition to soil type, water availability, cultural practices, and nutrient supply. The book briefly explains the fruit morphology, anatomy, physiology and biochemistry, growth phases, maturity standards, grades, and physical and mechanical characteristics of citrus trees. It also provides the foundation for understanding the growth, harvest, and post-harvest aspects of citrus fruits. Insect pests and diseases, irrigation, nutrition, and rootstocks are also addressed in this book",

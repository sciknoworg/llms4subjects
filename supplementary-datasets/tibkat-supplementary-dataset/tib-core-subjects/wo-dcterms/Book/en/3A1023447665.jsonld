The chapters are well-chosen and are written by respected authors with international profiles. The book will be highly valued as a reference work, by research economists and practitioners, as well as by postgraduate students and professors at universities where distributional measurement theory and application is dealt with at the PhD level.'--Peter Lambert, University of Oregon, US. The very meaning of economic inequality is fundamental for understanding today's policy debates over issues such as interpreting changes in income inequality over time, across countries, or between groups within a society, as well as determining whether or not society is becoming more polarized with a shrinking middle class. Professor Becker has selected seminal papers covering topics including foundations of income inequality measurement, the social welfare view of inequality and directions for future research on economic inequality. Along with a new and original introduction, this essential single volume is an indispensable tool for scholars and practitioners alike",

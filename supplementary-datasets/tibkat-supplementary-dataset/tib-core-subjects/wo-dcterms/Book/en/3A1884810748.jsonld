                "Felix Hausdorff is a singular phenomenon in the history of science. As a mathematician, he played a major role in shaping the development of modern mathematics in the 20th century. He founded general topology as an independent mathematical discipline, while enriching set theory with a number of fundamental concepts and results. His general approach to measure and dimension led to profound developments in numerous mathematical disciplines, and today Hausdorff dimension plays a central role in fractal theory with its many fascinating applications by means of computer graphics. Hausdorff \u2019s remarkable mathematical versatility is reflected in his published work: today, no fewer than thirteen concepts, theorems and procedures carry his name. Yet he was not only a creative mathematician \u2013 Hausdorff was also an original philosophical thinker, a poet, essayist and man of letters. Under the pseudonym Paul Mongr\u00e9, he published a volume of aphorisms, an epistemological study, a book of poetry, an oft-performed play, and a number of notable essays in leading literary journals. As a Jew, Felix Hausdorff was increasingly persecuted and humiliated under the National Socialist dictatorship. When deportation to a concentration camp was imminent, he, along with his wife and sister-in law, decided to take their own lives. This book will be of interest to historians and mathematicians already fascinated by the rich life of Felix Hausdorff, as well as to those readers who wish to immerse themselves in the intricate web of intellectual and political transformations during this pivotal period in European history.",

                "Introduction to Global Logistics offers a step-by-step guide to global logistics. Covering the breadth of logistics, this highly accessible text covers everything you need to know and is illustrated by engaging case studies of market leaders. In this comprehensive book John Manners-Bell provides an in depth definition, description and exploration of the strategic principles and practices in transportation modes and supply chain verticals, including: freight forwarding, contract logistics, shipping, road freight, air cargo and express. The book also examines major sectors, including Automotive, Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Retail, Consumer, and High Tech. Introduction to Global Logistics offers a detailed examination of key topics, including: how the logistics industry has developed, how it is influenced by macro-economic factors and demand-side trends, what the risks are to the industry, and how it will develop over the coming years. It examines important trends and developments that are shaping the industry, including 3D printing, megacities, and post-harvest food losses.",
                "The new edition of Introduction to Global Logistics considers how the logistics industry has developed; how it is influenced by macro-economic factors and demand-side trends; what the risks are to the industry and how it will develop over the coming years. Author John Manners-Bell examines individual logistics segments looking at each one's unique microeconomic dynamics. He explains how logistics companies' revenues and profitability are affected by a downturn and how this is governed by such factors as whether they own assets or manage them.Chapters define, explore, and describe six key logistics segments: freight forwarding, contract logistics, shipping, road freight, air cargo, and express, while also examining the individual supply chain dynamics and logistics demands of the major vertical sectors: Automotive, Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Retail, Consumer, and High Tech. The book covers important trends and developments that are shaping the industry, including 3D printing, megacities, and post-harvest food losses."

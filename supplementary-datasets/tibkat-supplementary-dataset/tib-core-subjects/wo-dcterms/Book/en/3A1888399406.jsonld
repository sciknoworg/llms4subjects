            "abstract": "This book compiles research and surveys devoted to the areas of mathematical analysis, approximation theory, and optimization. Being dedicated to A.-M. Legendre's work, contributions to this volume are devoted to those branches of mathematics and its applications that have been influenced, directly or indirectly, by the mathematician. Additional contributions provide a historical background as it relates to Legendre's work and its association to the foundation of Greece's higher education. Topics covered in this book include the investigation of the Jensen-Steffensen inequality, Ostrowski and trapezoid type inequalities, a Hilbert-Type Inequality, Hardy\u2019s inequality, dynamic unilateral contact problems, square-free values of a category of integers, a maximum principle for general nonlinear operators, the application of Ergodic Theory to an alternating series expansion for real numbers, bounds for similarity condition numbers of unbounded operators, finite element methods with higher order polynomials, generating functions for the Fubini type polynomials, local asymptotics for orthonormal polynomials, trends in geometric function theory, quasi variational inclusions, Kleene fixed point theorems, ergodic states, spontaneous symmetry breaking and quasi-averages. It is hoped that this book will be of interest to a wide spectrum of readers from several areas of pure and applied sciences, and will be useful to undergraduate students, graduate level students, and researchers who want to be kept up to date on the results and theories in the subjects covered in this volume.",

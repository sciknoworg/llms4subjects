            "abstract": "The book provides a vivid introduction to a world of gods and ancestors, their histories and deeds, anchored in the temples built by the inhabitants of a village which is situated on the outskirts of a large tourist centre in South Bali. The author unravels the history of this village by analysing and documenting its 50 temples, their location in the settlement, their form and layout, the social groups with which they are associated and their links to other local and regional temples as well as to the rituals held there. The work demonstrates in an exemplary fashion how the organisation and shaping of space serves as a key to the understanding of past events and of the social processes tied to these: A new way of writing space-orientated history",

                "This book makes the extremely complex process of architectural perception far more transparent and thus contributes to a better understanding of our built environment. Why is there so much debate about the appearance of our built environment, about the aesthetics of architecture today? Why do opinions about the aesthetic quality of buildings often diverge extremely even among experts? Why can\u2019t we agree on architecture, on what is beautiful and what is not? Most areas of construction, such as statics and building physics, are measurable and can therefore be substantiated with objective arguments. Yet this does not apply to the unquantifiable aesthetics of architecture. Accordingly, judgments on aesthetics are always subject-specific, and strongly dependent on the viewer. Nevertheless, the aesthetics of architecture is not just a matter of taste. Many relationships between buildings as objects and viewers as subjects can be determined objectively with the help of perceptual psychology and information theory, as this book demonstrates. The content - Foundations of perception - Part and whole - Culture and style - Site and surroundings - Space - Form - Harmony - Aesthetics and beauty - Movement and path - Light and colour - Signs The target group Architects and architecture students, interested in architecture The author J\u00f6rg Kurt Gr\u00fctter studied architecture at the ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) in Zurich and at Kyoto University in Japan. He has been a Professor of Architecture Theory at the University of Applied Sciences in Bern, and a Visiting Professor at the European branch of the SCI-Arc (Southern California Institute of Architecture) in Vico Morcote, at the Art University in Isfahan, Iran, and at Namibia University of Science and Technology in Windhoek. .",

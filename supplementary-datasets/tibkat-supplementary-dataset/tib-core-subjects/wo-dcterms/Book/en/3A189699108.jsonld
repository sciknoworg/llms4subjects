            "abstract": "\"It is taken as an article of faith among software development professionals that Integrated Computer-Aided Software Engineering (I-CASE) tools are an appropriate response to the problems that plague the profession. However, when I-CASE is observed in practice what is generally seen is (a) limited adoption, and (b) significant amounts of abandonment of the technology after adoption. A number of academic and practitioner authors have suggested the presence of a 'learning curve' as a partial explanation of this phenomenon. These suggestions may be seen as the first, or problem identification stage of research. The purpose of this paper is to go beyond these suggestions and begin the second stage of research, model development, in order that a formal approach can be used to determine appropriate I-CASE investment evaluations. This paper will explain the learning curve concept within the context of I-CASE and will propose a set of three models that may be employed. While not proceeding to the third or  model validation stage, this paper will suggest some difficulties, both theoretical and practical, in making further progress in this area and will offer some suggestions as to how these might be overcome. Finally, some concluding remarks which place the research in a broader management context are provided.\"--CISR abstracts",

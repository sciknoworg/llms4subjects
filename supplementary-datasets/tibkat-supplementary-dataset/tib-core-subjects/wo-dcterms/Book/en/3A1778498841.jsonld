            "abstract": "Neutrosophy (1995) is a new branch of philosophy that studies triads of the form (<A>, <neutA>, <antiA>), where <A> is an entity {i.e. element, concept, idea, theory, logical proposition, etc.}, <antiA> is the opposite of <A>, while <neutA> is the neutral (or indeterminate) between them, i.e., neither <A> nor <antiA>.Based on neutrosophy, the neutrosophic triplets were founded, which have a similar form (x, neut(x), anti(x)), that satisfy several axioms, for each element x in a given set.This collective book presents original research papers by many neutrosophic researchers from around the world, that report on the state-of-the-art and recent advancements of neutrosophic triplets, neutrosophic duplets, neutrosophic multisets and their algebraic structures \u2013 that have been defined recently in 2016 but have gained interest from world researchers. Connections between classical algebraic structures and neutrosophic triplet / duplet / multiset structures are also studied. And numerous neutrosophic applications in various fields, such as: multi-criteria decision making, image segmentation, medical diagnosis, fault diagnosis, clustering data, neutrosophic probability, human resource management, strategic planning, forecasting model, multi-granulation, supplier selection problems, typhoon disaster evaluation, skin lesson detection, mining algorithm for big data analysis, etc",

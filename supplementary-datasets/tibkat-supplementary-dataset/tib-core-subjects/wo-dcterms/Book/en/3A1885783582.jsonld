            "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the significance of theory in conducting a research project. It offers guidance to research students and early career researchers in selecting and using theory in their research. The chapter covers definitions of theory, theory classifications, and the difference between theory and other research elements. It also addresses issues, such as choosing a theory, why it is important to go back to and understand a theory\u2019s origins, disciplinary home and level at which it has been proposed and utilised, and what to consider when attempting to work with more than a single theory. The issue of achieving good fit between theory and a research project\u2019s other components (research question, prior state of research, methodology (where applicable), and contribution) is also examined. The chapter cautions against over-emphasising a theoretical contribution and against claiming one engages in theory building when applying a theory. Throughout the chapter, the metaphor of theory as a tool in the process of crafting research is used",

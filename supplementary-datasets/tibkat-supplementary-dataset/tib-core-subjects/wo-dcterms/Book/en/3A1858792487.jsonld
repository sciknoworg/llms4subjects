                "This volume offers a cross-section of a good fifteen years of research in the sociology of technology and innovation at the Sociology of Technology working group at the Technical University of Berlin. All contributions in this volume were initiated or discussed there and thus bear in a certain sense a \"Berlin signature\" - not in the sense of a clearly delimited scientific school, but rather in the form of an open discussion group with different, but mutually related focal points. The Berlin key, which received its scientific appreciation by Bruno Latour, imposes on its users the following program of action: \"User, if you want to take the key back to yourself after unlocking the door and go your way, you must lock the door again first.\" Unlike that Berlin key, the \"Berlin Keys to the Sociology of Technology\" presented here offer a set of keys to different but interconnected conceptual and methodological approaches in social science research on technology and innovation. The content Distributed action and the agency of things Innovation as object and question Heterogeneous socio-technical assemblies The target groups Lecturers and students of sociology and social sciences The editors Cornelius Schubert is Professor of Sociology of Science and Technology at the Department of Social Sciences at the Technical University of Dortmund. Ingo Schulz-Schaeffer is Professor of Sociology of Technology and Innovation at the Institute of Sociology at the Technical University of Berlin. This book is a translation of an original German edition. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation.",

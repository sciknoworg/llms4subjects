            "abstract": "\"Present book is focused on dynamic design of structures and systems, requiring integration of the numerical modelling tools, experimental techniques of system identification and model updating. The topics of structural dynamic modelling using finite element method, principles of vibration control and system identification using modal testing and FE model updating are presented towards the goal of dynamic design. It gives a unified treatment to these domains in the context of dynamic design for better understanding and appreciation of effective and optimum utilization of the potential of individual techniques to achieve dynamically sound designs. Features: Brings all theoretical and experimental elements required for vibration and dynamic design in a unified way in one place. Shows link between different technologies that need to be employed for dynamic design. Focuses on experimental and numerical tools for dynamic design. Discusses elements required for theoretical and experimental modal testing. Understand the need and techniques of FE model correlation and updating and how it can yield more accurate and reliable predictions. This book is aimed at Senior undergraduates/graduates in structural dynamics; Mechanical, Aerospace, Automotive and Civil Engineering, vibration, modal analysis and testing, structural optimization for dynamic design, dynamic finite element analysis, vibration control and signal processing\"--",

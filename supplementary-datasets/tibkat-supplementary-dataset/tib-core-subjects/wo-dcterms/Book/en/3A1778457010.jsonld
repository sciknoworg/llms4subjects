            "title": "New Industry 4.0 Advances in Industrial IoT and Visual Computing for Manufacturing Processes",
            "abstract": "Modern factories are experiencing rapid digital transformation supported by emerging technologies, such as the Industrial Internet of things (IIOT), industrial big data and cloud technologies, deep learning and deep analytics, AI, intelligent robotics, cyber-physical systems and digital twins, complemented by visual computing (including new forms of artificial vision with machine learning, novel HMI, simulation, and visualization). This is evident in the global trend of Industry 4.0. The impact of these technologies is clear in the context of high-performance manufacturing. Important improvements can be achieved in productivity, systems reliability, quality verification, etc. Manufacturing processes, based on advanced mechanical principles, are enhanced by big data analytics on industrial sensor data. In current machine tools and systems, complex sensors gather useful data, which is captured, stored, and processed with edge, fog, or cloud computing. These processes improve with digital monitoring, visual data analytics, AI, and computer vision to achieve a more productive and reliable smart factory. New value chains are also emerging from these technological changes. This book addresses these topics, including contributions deployed in production, as well as general aspects of Industry 4.0",

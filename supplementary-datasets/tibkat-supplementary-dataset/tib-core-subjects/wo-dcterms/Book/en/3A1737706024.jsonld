            "title": "Handbook of dairy foods analysis",
            "abstract": "\"Dairy foods account for a large portion of the Western diet, but due to the potential diversity of their sources, this food group often poses a challenge for food scientists and their research efforts. Bringing together the foremost minds in dairy research, Handbook of Dairy Foods Analysis, Second Edition, compiles the top dairy analysis techniques and methodologies from around the world into one, well-organized volume. Exceptionally comprehensive both in its detailing of methods and the range of dairy products covered, this handbook includes tools for analyzing chemical and biochemical compounds and also bioactive peptides, prebiotics, and probiotics. It describes noninvasive chemical and physical sensors and starter cultures used in quality control. This second edition includes four brand new chapters covering the analytical techniques and methodologies for determining bioactive peptides, preservatives, activity of endogenous enzymes and sensory perception of dairy foods, and all other chapters have been adapted to recent research. All other chapters have been thoroughly updated. Covering the gamut of dairy analysis techniques, the book discusses current methods for the analysis of chemical and nutritional compounds, and the detection of microorganisms, allergens, contaminants and/or other adulterations, including those of environmental origin or introduced during processing. Other methodologies used to evaluate color, texture, and flavor are also discussed. Written by an international panel of distinguished contributors under the editorial guidance of renowned authorities, Fidel Toldr\u00e1 and Leo M.L. Nollet, this handbook is one of the few references that is completely devoted to dairy food analysis - a extremely valuable reference for those in the dairy research, processing, and manufacturing industries\"--",

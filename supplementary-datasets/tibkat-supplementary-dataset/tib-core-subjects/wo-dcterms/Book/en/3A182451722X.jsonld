            "abstract": [
                "\"Bangladesh is a country that has undergone rapid change across a wide range of sectors. Using an innovative interdisciplinary approach the authors examine new insights into understanding diverse themes such as nationalism, soft power, commodification and cultural identity, highlighting the contradictions and contention behind what the authors call \u2018the branding game\u2019.\" - David Lewis, Professor of Anthropology and Development, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK This book explores Bangladesh's shift from a 'bottomless pit' into a 'middle-income' category. Six chapters in the book cover topics on microfinance growth, ready-made garment production, and social safety net programs playing pivotal roles particularly for women empowerment. In doing so, the book shows that the net effect was not just a change to the country's limited number of representative brands, but also a realization of many more brands to have built up over time.

            "abstract": "\"The book has been written for the young and the curious, those who want to know, experiment and try out new things on a daily basis. The core audience of this book are those who use technology regularly, be it the smartphones, the headphones, the laptops, the iPads, the apps, the clouds, the video and the audio formats besides gaming, social media, viral marketing and many others. They also belong to an age group that nurtures dreams and aspirations to be quicker, smarter and change things for the better. A quick math would possibly show that you and around 3 billion others fall in that group. People who want to know what technology is - in simple language without the jargon. Technology told through incidents that are relatable to everyday usage by consumers and gadget freaks and those that talk of changes we are accepting everyday making life a continuous learning process. The book is relevant because the changes that are happening now are not incremental, but tectonic by nature. This opens the door to a future that is more fascinating and threatening than fiction. The authors bring original insights from scientists and entrepreneurs, thought leaders and technologists who are working with frontline research and manufacturing organizations. We have framed this book as a series of entertaining and fast paced stories that explain the evolving innovations in science and technology. The events discussed here are occurring across the world and shaping our current lifestyle. The fact that some of these changes are leading to controversial practices will make us think. The purpose of this book is not to only sell 250 odd pages of text. It is to stoke the young mind and arouse interest, curiosity and empathy about the imperfect world that we are shaping today\"--",

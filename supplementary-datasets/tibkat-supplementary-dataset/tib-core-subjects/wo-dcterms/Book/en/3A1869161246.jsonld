As is apparent, this year's ICCBIC established a partnership with the MDPI publishing house. Therefore, we invite you to form a picture of the spirit of the conference by reading this reprint version of Special Issue of Inorganics, which is devoted to this conference. In total, ten contributions were submitted, of which eight are original papers and two are perspectives",

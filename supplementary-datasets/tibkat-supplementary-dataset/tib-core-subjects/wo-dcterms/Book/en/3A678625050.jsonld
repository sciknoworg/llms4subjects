                "\"Principles of Power Engineering Analysis presents the basic tools required to understand the components in an electric power transmission system. Classroom-tested at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, this text is the only up-to-date one available that covers power system analysis at the graduate level. The book explains from first principles the expressions that predict the performance of transmission systems and transformers. It then extends these concepts to balanced three-phase systems and unbalanced systems. The authors proceed to introduce symmetrical component analysis of transmission systems, three-phase transformers, and faulted systems. They also describe the design of untransposed transmission lines and discuss other analysis component systems, such as Clarke component networks. Despite the tremendous changes that have occurred in the electrical industry over the last forty years, the need for a fundamental understanding of power system analysis has not changed. Suitable for a one-semester course, this book develops the necessary concepts in depth and illustrates the application of three-phase electric power transmission\"--Provided by publisher",
                "\"Preface In the late 1800s as electrical engineering programs were taking shape, they were structured to emphasize power generation, transmission, and its utilization. However, by the middle of the 20th century in recognition of the vast advances in controls, electronics, and computers these programs were being drastically restructured as they moved away from the traditional core. This transition was so swift and complete that within a decade few electrical engineering programs offered more than a class or two in electric power. Utilities and manufactures of heavy electrical equipment, still in need of competent practitioners, found it difficult to find engineers with the desired skills in heavy threephase electrical power. Recognizing this situation Dr. Eric T. B. Gross, with the financial support of American Electric Power, formed the Department of Electric Power Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). The primary purpose of this department was to educate power engineers to fill this void. A unique characteristic of this department from its onset was its focus on the masters degree rather than the bachelors or doctorate. Additionally, the student was encouraged to complete the program in a calender year. For the following four decades this program was one of the very few that offered graduate work in electric power engineering. In recognition of its successfully achieving its goal, students were consistently attracted to it from around the world. To facilitate graduation in a year, the program required the completion of 10 three credit hour classes without a dissertation. It was felt, I think with substantial justification, that a thesis at the masters degree level was of less value to an engineer than several well taught classes\"--Provided by publisher"

            "abstract": [
                "In this book, Eurasia will be discussed in the context of the Greater Eurasian Partnership proposed by Russia, the \u201ceastward\u201d transformations spurred by Neo-Eurasianism and the Greater Eurasian Partnership, and cooperation with China through the BRI, while related countries of Atlanticism was used to described the U.S., Europe, and their allies. The Greater Eurasian Partnership proposed by Russia is an initiative with specific diplomatic considerations, economic development strategies, and geopolitical implications. The initiative represents an attempt by Russia to shift foreign policy thinking, which has traditionally focused on alignment with the U.S. and the West. The Greater Eurasian Partnership contains both short-term strategies to cope with Western pressure and long-term strategic goals for building a new international and regional order. What this portends for the future of Sino-Russian relations is of interest to geopoliticians, economists and journalists. Professor Edmund Li Sheng received his M.A. and Ph.D. (political economy) from Universitaet Freiburg, Germany, after graduating with his BA from Peking University. He is currently a university distinguished professor at the Shandong University. His research has focused mainly on political economy and public policy.

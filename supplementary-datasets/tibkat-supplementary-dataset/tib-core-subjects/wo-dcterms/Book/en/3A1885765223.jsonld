            "abstract": "With a multi-perspective approach and transdisciplinary methods (humanities and sciences), this book offers an in-depth and systematic study of hand-drawn and hand-coloured maps from East Asia. Map colouring provides an insight into past societies, landscapes and territories. Colour is an important key to a more precise understanding of the map\u2019s content, purposes and uses; moreover, colours are also an important aspect of a map\u2019s materiality. The material scientific analysis of colourants makes it possible to find out more about maps\u2019 material nature and their production as well as the social, geographical and political context in which they were made. \u2018Reading\u2019 colours in this way gives a glimpse into the social lives of mapmakers as well as map users and reveals the complexity of the historical and social context in which maps were produced and how the maps were actually made",

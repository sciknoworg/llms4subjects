                "The second edition of Annals of Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy provides entirely new insights into a number of the leading issues surrounding the teaching of entrepreneurship and the building of entrepreneurship programs. Prepared under the auspices of the United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship (USASBE), this book features fifteen scholarly perspectives on a range of entrepreneurship education issues. This 2016 edition spans topics ranging from methods for teaching creatively and the value of the lean startup methodology to empirical insights into whether or not entrepreneurship education changes minds. Five premier universities and the key aspects of their superlative entrepreneurship programs are reviewed. In addition, contributors highlight a number of individual innovations that have changed the way entrepreneurship is taught and the manner in which entrepreneurial behavior is facilitated. This book offers an introduction to innovative practices in facilitating entrepreneurial learning both inside and outside the classroom as it investigates critical issues in designing, implementing and assessing experiential learning techniques within entrepreneurship. This timely book uncovers new horizons in the development of entrepreneurship education for students, university campuses, communities and economies. Annals of Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy - 2016 is a must-have book for any entrepreneurship professor, scholar or program director across the US"

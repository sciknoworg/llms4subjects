            "title": "Chapter 2 Epidemics and subaltern classes",
            "abstract": "This chapter addresses the interpretations of the emerging social question in the field of post-revolutionary French liberalism. It focuses on the cholera outbreak of 1832 to describe how it fostered unprecedented and dramatic representations of urban pauperism chiefly marked by feelings of panic and distress with respect to the new \u201cdangerous classes\u201d brought into being by the Industrial Revolution. By analysing the pandemic crisis, the chapter shows that these subjects were initially perceived not merely as a different social class, but also \u2013 and especially \u2013 as a different \u201crace,\u201d according to a conception exemplified by the metaphor of \u201cnew barbarians\u201d invading the manufacturing cities. Hence, the chapter retraces a transformation whereby these initial representations of the subaltern classes based on fear and exclusion gradually gave way to the rise of social research on the subaltern classes aimed at elaborating new welfare policies as risk reduction strategies. These initiatives of social investigation are described as marking the origins of the methods and epistemology of modern social sciences, which are the focus of the following chapter",

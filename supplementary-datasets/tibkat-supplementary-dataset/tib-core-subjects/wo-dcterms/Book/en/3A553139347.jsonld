By such a way of ploughing and corneing old courser pasture, as not to impoverish it, and by such a method of enclosure, as shall provide for poore, and all interests without depopulation -- 4. By discovering divers materials for soyle and compost, with the nature and use of them, as both tillage and pasture be advanced as high as promised -- 5. By such a new plantation of divers sorts of woods, as in twenty yeares, they shall rise more than in forty yeares naturally -- 6. By a more moderate improvement of other sorts of lands, according to their capacities they lye under, by more common experiences.",

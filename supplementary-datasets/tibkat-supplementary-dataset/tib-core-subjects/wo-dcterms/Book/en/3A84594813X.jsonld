            "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Spain\u2019s ESM-supported program of financial sector reform aimed to assist economic recovery by promoting financial stability. The program was adopted in mid-2012. At the time, Spain\u2019s real-estate bust and the euro-area debt crisis had combined to fuel a vicious cycle of failing banks, unsustainable fiscal deficits, rising borrowing costs, contracting output, rapid job loss, and severe financial market turmoil. The program aimed to stem the financial sector\u2019s contribution to these forces by requiring weak banks to more decisively clean their balance sheets and by reforming the sector\u2019s policy framework. These efforts aimed in turn to support economic recovery by improving banks\u2019 access to market funding and by avoiding a disruptive and disorderly unwinding of a significant part of the sector. The program\u2019s strategy built on reforms that the authorities had already undertaken during the crisis (e.g., stronger provisioning requirements) and was developed in consultation with Spain\u2019s European partners, was supported by ESM financing, and was consistent with the main recommendations from IMF staff\u2019s June 2012 Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) and Article IV consultation. The Spanish authorities\u2019 implementation of the program has been steadfast. All of the program\u2019s specific measures are now complete. These have included the following key actions: \u2022 identifying undercapitalized banks via a comprehensive asset quality review and independent stress test; \u2022 requiring banks to address their capital shortfalls, including if necessary through bail-ins of junior debt and injections of public capital; \u2022 reducing uncertainty regarding the strength of banks\u2019 balance sheets and boosting liquidity by segregating state-aided banks\u2019 most illiquid and difficult-to-value assets into a separate, newly created asset management company (SAREB); \u2022 adopting plans to restructure or resolve state-aided banks within a few years, with implementation now well underway; and \u2022 reforming Spain\u2019s frameworks for bank resolution, regulation, and supervision to facilitate a more orderly clean-up and better promote financial stability and protect the taxpayer. These efforts have substantially reduced threats emanating from banks to the rest of the economy, as has important policy progress at the European level. \u2022 Actions under the program have significantly strengthened the system\u2019s capital, liquidity, and loan-loss provisionin ...",

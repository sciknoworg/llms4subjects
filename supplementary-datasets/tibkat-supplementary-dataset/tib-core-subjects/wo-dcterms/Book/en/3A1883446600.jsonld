                "This book provides a comprehensive and authoritative review of recent developments in bio-based packaging materials along with an array of their industrial applications. It offers an interdisciplinary approach, combining food engineering, polymer science, materials science, and sustainable aspects of bio-based materials with their synthesis, properties, characterization, and applications in packaging materials. The book encloses chapters covering fundamental concepts, manufacturing, properties, characterization, and interaction of bio-based materials. It also discusses topics related to the different usage of bio-based materials, their environmental impact, regulations, safety aspects, circular economy, challenges, and opportunities allied to bio-based materials. It is an essential resource for academicians, researchers, students, and professionals interested in exploring the potential bio-based materials in food packaging."

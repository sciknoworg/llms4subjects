            "abstract": [
                "Applications are the parts of computer systems which directly satisfy users' requirements for infor\u00ad mation processing. Effective development of applications is the key to the success of any computer\u00ad related project. This is why the dominant part of investment in computer systems development is dedicated to applications. However, little work has been published so far on how to develop appli\u00ad cations effectively. \"Application Development Systems\" directly resolves this omission by presenting basic approaches, both theoretical, e.g., methodologies and frameworks, and practical, e.g., applica\u00ad tion development tools and environments, to effective development of applications. Many world famous cases of successful application development in the USA, Europe, and Japan are also pre\u00ad sented. From this book, the reader will gradually gain an insight into such successful cases as those of General Motors, Toyota, IBM, Yamaha, Nippon Steel, Mitsui Shipbuilding, Mitsui Bank, and Xerox. This book has taken over 4 years to compile and edit. Indeed, without the contribution of many leading figures in academic fields and industry and the support of IBM Japan and IBM World Trade, this task could not have been achieved. Three consecutive IBM Computer Science Sym\u00ad posia in 1983,1984, and 1985 were dedicated to the theme of application development. All the contributions from these symposia were reviewed and revised several times before being made into this volume.",

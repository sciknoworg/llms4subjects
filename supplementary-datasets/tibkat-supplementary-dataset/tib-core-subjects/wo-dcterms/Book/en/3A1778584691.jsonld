            "abstract": "Early in the twenty-first century, Louisiana, one of the poorest states in the United States, redirected millions in tax dollars from the public coffers in an effort to become the top location site globally for the production of Hollywood films and television series. Why would lawmakers support such a policy? Why would citizens accept the policy\u2019s uncomfortable effects on their economy and culture? Almost Hollywood, Nearly New Orleans addresses these questions through a study of the local and everyday experiences of the film economy in New Orleans, Louisiana\u2014a city that has twice taken the mantle of becoming a movie production capital. From the silent era to today\u2019s Hollywood South, Vicki Mayer explains that the aura of a film economy is inseparable from a prevailing sense of home, even as it changes that place irrevocably.  \u201cA scathing critique of the economic realities and broken promises of Hollywood South, told in rich ethnographic detail and passionately argued through Vicki Mayer\u2019s deep connection to New Orleans. This is a vital book.\u201d  -NITIN GOVIL, author of Orienting Hollywood: A Century of Film Culture between Los Angeles and Bombay  \u201cMayer guides readers through the numbers and arguments behind Louisiana\u2019s costly love affair with the film industry and raises important questions over whether the state\u2019s citizens are getting their money\u2019s worth.\u201d  -STEPHANIE GRACE, columnist, The New Orleans Advocate  \u201cA visionary in the study of cultural labor, economy, and geography, Mayer is that rare writer who combines exquisite storytelling with rigorous scholarship. This is an essential contribution to film and media studies, and an urgent history lesson for policy makers.\u201d  -MELISSA GREGG, author of Work\u2019s Intimacy  VICKI MAYER is Professor of Communication at Tulane University.

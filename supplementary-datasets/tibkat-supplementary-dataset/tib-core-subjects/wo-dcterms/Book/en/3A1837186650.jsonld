                "This open-access book presents a unique interdisciplinary analysis of integrated urban initiatives promoted by the EU and their added values. This text presents a general analytical frame to study these initiatives as complex multi-level policy mixes from a comparative perspective. Cross-sectional and over-time analyses at the territorial level targeted by these initiatives are done to study the policy design, theory and impacts of urban integrated strategies. The book includes a new methodology to analyse the design and theory of urban plans (the comparative urban portfolio analysis) and quasi-experimental approaches to perform impact assessment at the neighbourhood level (the territorial target of those initiatives). Although empirical analyses focus on all local integrated plans implemented in Spain from 1994 to 2013, analytical and methodological outcomes can be applied in a broader context to analyse integral urban policies in other countries.

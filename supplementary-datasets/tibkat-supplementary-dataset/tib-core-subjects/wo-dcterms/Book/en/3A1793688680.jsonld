                "This is unacceptable. Twentieth-century journalism ethics were good for America, but no longer suffice -- Racial inequity is still pervasive and ominous -- Economic disparity grows and grows -- Climate change advances on us -- Democracy itself hangs in the balance -- Politicians today won't compromise, producing government gridlock -- Discomfiting realities are also opportunities. The ethics of care nicely complements existing codes of ethics -- Current codes of ethics render high professional standards that endure, and should -- The bright side of the financial pressure on the media -- Not-for-profit journalism makes sense (if not money) -- The road to success redefined. Ethical media continue to drive public discourse -- Coverage of conscience coincides with journalists' motivations -- The caring newsroom : diverse, purposeful, committed to results.",
                "This book makes the case for the news media to take the lead in combatting key threats to American society including racial injustice, economic disparity, and climate change by adopting an \"ethics of care\" in reporting practices.Examining how traditional news coverage of race, economics and climate change has been dedicated to straightforward facts, the author asserts that journalism should now respond to societal needs by adopting a moral philosophy of the \"ethics of care,\" opening the door to empathetic yet factual and fair coverage of news events, with a goal to move public opinion to the point that politicians are persuaded to take effective action. The book charts a clear path for how this style of ethics can be applied by today\u2019s journalists, tracing the emergence of this empathy-based ethics from feminist philosophy in the 1980s. It ultimately urges ethical news organizations to adopt the ethics of care, based on the human emotion prioritized by Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume, and to pursue a more pro-active, solutions-seeking coverage of current events.This is an invaluable text for students and academics in the fields of journalism ethics, media ethics and media law, as well as for media professionals looking for a fresh perspective on practicing ethical journalism."

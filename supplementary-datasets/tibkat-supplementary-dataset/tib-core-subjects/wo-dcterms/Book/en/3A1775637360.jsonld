                "In this book, the author provides detailed assumptions and derivations in the stochastic modelling and performance evaluation of anti-aircraft gun-based air defence systems engaging attacking three-dimensional aerial targets. Beginning with the stochastic modelling of the effect of anti-aircraft gun disturbances, the author goes on to consider the flight dynamics model of the projectile, the formulation and numerical solution to the fire control problem, and calculations for hit probability in scenarios involving either one or multiple anti-aircraft guns. Finally, the author presents the computations necessary to delineate a continuous ground impact region that has a high probability of enclosing the ground impact points of projectiles fired. This book is of interest to both academic researchers and graduate students in the field of defence, as well as to industrial professionals",

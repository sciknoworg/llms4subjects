                "This Open Access book presents an in-depth portrait of the use and impact of digital technologies by learners ages 5-18 years in their everyday lives. The portrait is framed by the ecological-systems theory and situated across four domains: home, leisure time, education, and civic participation. Various methodological approaches are used in innovative ways to analyze data collected in a large-scale EU Horizon 2020 project. The purpose of this edited collection is to shed light on both beneficial and harmful effects of digital technology from a perspective that children are active agents who are empowered to accentuate the positives of digital technology use and over common challenges that inhibit digital competence with support from education stakeholders. This is an open access book. Halla B. Holmarsdottir is Professor at the Faculty of Education and International Studies, Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway. Idunn Seland is associate professor at the Faculty of Education and International Studies, Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway. Christer Hyggen is Research professor at the department of Youth research under the Centre for Welfare and Labour Research, Norwegian Social research at Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway.

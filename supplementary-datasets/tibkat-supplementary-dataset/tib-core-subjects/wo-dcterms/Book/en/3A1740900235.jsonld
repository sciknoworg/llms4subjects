            "title": "Dislocation Theory",
            "abstract": "\"Dislocation Theory\" covers the research into this fascinating field which was reported in the period: 1995-1999. The coverage is limited to purely theoretical work; more practical aspects having certainly been covered by the relevant DDF volumes during that period. As indicated above, the widest possible range of dislocation phenomena has been included; with the exception of liquid crystal defects. But the coverage also includes that close relative of the dislocation; the disclination. The history of dislocations is one of the great success stories of physics, as applied to materials science. Beginning life as a purely theoretical construct in mathematics, with no apparent practical application to anything, the dislocation concept first enjoyed practical success when it was found that it could explain the worrying large discrepancy between the theoretical and real strengths of solids. \"All the difference\", as someone remarked, \"between trying to slide an entire carpet, or push a ruck across it\". The first observation of dislocations, using electron microscopy, must have been as satisfying as the confirmation of the light-bending predictions of relativity; an analogy which is not as inappropriate as it might seem. The analogies between moving dislocations in solids, and particles moving at relativistic speed in vacuum are mentioned in all good textbooks on dislocation theory; and this connection is reinforced by some of the abstracts in the present volume. Indeed, one paper even links dislocations to 'string theory'.The contents show that, as well as the classical topics of dislocation interaction during deformation, there is also intense interest in the propagation (threading) of dislocations into defect-free regions, and in the ability of dislocations to relieve stress between layers. These capabilities, one bad and one good, are naturally of great importance to the semiconductor industry. There is also an interesting ongoing dispute between the 'minimum-energy' and 'dissipative structure' views concerning dislocation phenomena such as veining. The polemic between classical equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium approaches again mirrors similar disagreements in physical science as a whole. This wide-ranging and up-to-date guide to the field will be of interest to physicists, materials scientists, and electronics engineers",

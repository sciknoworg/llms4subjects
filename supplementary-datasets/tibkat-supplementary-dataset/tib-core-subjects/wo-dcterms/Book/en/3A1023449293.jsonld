This authoritative research review is the first of its kind to bring together seminal works from leading scholars in economic development and in competition law. This encompasses the most up-to-date and rigorous methodologies of empirical and technical analysis, with a specific focus on the problem of developing countries. This research review discusses the theoretical and political foundations of competition policies versus industrial policies and the raging debate between market-based versus interventionist industrialization policies as well as including the most relevant literature on competition law and enforcement in developing countries, including a cross section and case study perspective",

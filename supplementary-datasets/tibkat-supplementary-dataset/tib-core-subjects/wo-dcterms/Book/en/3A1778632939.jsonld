            "abstract": "Lace Narratives: A monograph, 2005 \u2013 2015 documents Cecilia Heffer\u2019s innovative lace-making practice over a decade, including major exhibitions and commissions. This publication examines ways that Cecilia\u2019s research practice responds to changing ideas and technologies as a means to extend our perception of textiles. It presents an in-depth reflection on studio practice in a discursive spirit, responding to the question: What has the studio enquiry revealed that could not have been revealed through other modes of research? The publication is composed of a digital edition of the book, along with a seven-minute video documenting Cecilia creating the lace-work Drawn Threads. A print-on-demand version of the book in either hard cover or paperback is available for purchase. Additionally, a limited edition artist\u2019s book with lace samples bound into the pages will be publicly available through selected libraries and museums, including the UTS Library. Through these different components, the audience can watch Cecilia\u2019s lace-making innovations in the documentary video, read critical reflections on her research and creative process, and handle lace samples. This combination affords a holistic understanding of Cecilia\u2019s practice-led research and material output. This is an experimental publication model conceived by Zo\u00eb Sadokierski for the MediaObject book series and produced with support from the UTS Library",

Introductory topics are first presented including: time, space, and matter; different coordinate systems; vectors; and unit vectors;. The author presents tools such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration to describe projectile motion and uniform circular motion. Newton\u2019s laws of motion and concepts of force and mass are discussed followed by kinetic energy, potential energy, and both conservative and non-conservative forces. This class-tested book also introduces angular displacement, angular speed, and angular acceleration as well as the use of these to describe the motion of particles with constant angular acceleration. Concepts of torque, angular momentum, and rotational inertia are presented to explain the motion of physical pendulum. Motion under central force is also covered and Kepler\u2019s laws are derived. In addition, this book: Features topics related to coordinate systems and vectors and introduces kinetic energy and potential energy Presents Newton\u2019s laws of motion, introduces force and mass, and explains frictional force and oscillatory motion Details motion with frictional force, uniform circular motion, and rotational motion and planetary motion in light of Newtonian mechanics.",

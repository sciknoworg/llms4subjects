            "abstract": "Nothing in MoMA is a series of photographs captured in areas of Manhattan museums in which there are no artworks, written words, or people. Addressing the \u201cgrammar that organizes and secures our scene of looking,\u201d in the words of art historian David Joselit\u2019s introduction, the book imagines a composite empty museum or a narrative of marginal attention. Originally displayed in partial prototype as a children\u2019s board book at Artists Space in 2015, Nothing in MoMA is here collected for the first time in the series\u2019 entirety. Evoking the history of indeterminacy as much as that of institutional critique, the deadpan composition of Adams\u2019s photographs likewise recalls Fran\u00e7ois Jullien\u2019s theory of bland aesthetics, in a playful reductio of socio-institutional space to a bare literality. Both a visual essay on museum phenomenology and a performance document, Nothing in MoMA describes a choreography of avoidance, in which a conceptual constraint becomes a means of seeing and navigating concrete space",

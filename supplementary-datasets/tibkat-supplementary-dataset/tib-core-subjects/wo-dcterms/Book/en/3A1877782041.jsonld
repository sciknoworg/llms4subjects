It explains how this method can be used to assist investigators and prosecutors to clearly and fairly demonstrate that a person has acquired and/or used funds that cannot be explained by reference to their legal income.This technical guidance addition also provides an outline of the common types of financial evidence that should be sought when conducting an investigation into illicit enrichment",

            "abstract": "Several critics have been intrigued by the gap between late Victorian poetry andthe more \u201cmodern\u201d poetry of the 1920s. It is my contention that a close analysisof the poetry and criticism written in the first decade of the 20th century anduntil the end of the First World War \u2013 excluding war poetry \u2013 will be rewardingif we want to acquire a greater understanding of the transition.The book is not meant as a total overview of the intellectual climate in Englandfrom Tennyson to Eliot. Rather, it describes the development that tookplace within art and literature \u2013 especially poetry \u2013 as a reaction against thepositivist attitude. Early in the 19th century, science came to be taken as theopposite of poetry because the Romanticists conceived of the lyrical poem asthe outlet of the poet\u2019s feelings. That attitude was dominant during the rest ofthe 19th century.To many readers and critics, T.E.Hulme represents little more thasn a footnote.He is vaguely known as one of the precursors of the far more interestingT.S.Eliot, for which reason some lip-service may be paid to him, but his ownachievement is hardly ever referred to.Hulme and the Imagists represent an intermediary stage between Tennysonand Eliot, but they are more than mere stepping-stones. Besides being experimentingpoets, most of them are acute critics of art and literature, prescriptivelyas well as descriptively. Hulme\u2019s theories are sketchy, his presentation notinfrequently confusing, and his poetry mostly fragments. The following pagesattempt to analyse his oeuvre, a material hardly anybody has taken the troubleto consider in its entirety, He understood that some form of theory is a usefulaccompaniment of poetic practice, and, like his Imagist friends, he made thepoetic image the focus of his attention. The Imagists were opposed not only tothe monopoly of science, scientia scientium, which claimed to be able to decidewhat truth and reality \u201creally\u201d were, but also to the \u201cTennysonianisms\u201d, which,they felt, had made poetry predictable and insipid.This book attempts to get to grips with the watershed.I owe Professor Lars Ole Sauerberg my heartfelt gratitude for his advice,encouragement and patience during the process of writing this book",

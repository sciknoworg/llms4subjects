                "The volume delves into the intricate web of contemporary permacrisis rooted in the strategic imperatives of nation-states. Through a historical lens, it navigates the evolving landscape of international politics, tracing the transition of power dynamics from purely military to a fusion of economic and military prowess. The contributions in the volume argue that this shift has redefined the traditional balance of power, with economic instruments emerging as potent tools for geopolitical manoeuvring. Examining the interplay of geopolitical, geoeconomic, and security imperatives, it scrutinises the complex relationships that often perpetuate crises instead of global stability. It sheds light on the unprecedented hybridity of modern warfare, where military and economic dimensions intertwine, exemplified by the ongoing tensions between the liberal international order on the one hand, and Russia and China on the other. Recognising this complexity, the volume raises concerns about the uneven capacity of states to navigate these imperatives. Beneficial for specialists in International Relations and Strategic Studies, policymakers, security experts, scholars, and postgraduate students, this comprehensive volume offers insights into the intricate dynamics of geopolitics, political economy, and security issues of our time.

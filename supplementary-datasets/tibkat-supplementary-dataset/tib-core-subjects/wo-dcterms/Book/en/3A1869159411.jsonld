            "abstract": "Women\u2019s tanci, or \u201cplucking rhymes,\u201d are chantefable narratives written by upper-class educated women from seventeenth-century to early twentieth-century China. Writing Gender in Early Modern Chinese Women\u2019s Tanci Fiction offers a timely study on early modern Chinese women\u2019s representations of gender, nation, and political activism in their tanci works before and after the Taiping Rebellion (1850 to 1864), as well as their depictions of warfare and social unrest. Women tanci authors\u2019 redefinition of female exemplarity within the Confucian orthodox discourses of virtue, talent, chastity, and political integrity could be bourgeoning expressions of female exceptionalism and could have foreshadowed protofeminist ideals of heroism. They establish a realistic tenor in affirming feminine domestic authority, and open up spaces for discussions of \u201cwomanly becoming,\u201d female exceptionalism, and shifting family power structures.The vernacular mode underlying these texts yields productive possibilities of gendered self-representations, bodily valences, and dynamic performances of sexual roles. The result is a vernacular discursive frame that enables women\u2019s appropriation and refashioning of orthodox moral values as means of self-affirmation and self-realization. Validations of women\u2019s political activism and loyalism to the nation attest to tanci as a premium vehicle for disseminating progressive social incentives to popular audiences. Women\u2019s tanci marks early modern writers\u2019 endeavors to carve out a space of feminine becoming, a discursive arena of feminine appropriation, reinvention, and boundary-crossings. In this light, women\u2019s tanci portrays gendered mobility through depictions of a heroine\u2019s voyages or social ascent, and entails a forward-moving historical progression toward a more autonomous and vested model of feminine subjectivity",

            "abstract": "\"Education and media services have much in common. Both provide services that embody local cultures, in which there is extensive public sector participation and significant domestic regulation. Both are dramatically affected by the information and communications technology revolution. The production of information content now involves huge costs in terms of research and development or artistic talent, whilst the cost of making such products available to other consumers is very low. This in turn challenges the effectiveness of domestic regulation and raises fundamental questions about its purpose, calling for an increased scope for international trade and investment, and the development of supply chains. Yet, both areas are lightly committed in international trade agreements like the GATS. Trade Policy in Asia responds to these issues to provide readers with a comprehensive, consistent treatment of policy in the higher education and media services sector across various Asian economies. It identifies commonalities across these sectors and highlights critical trade policy implications. Education services themes include growth and impediments involved in trade and investment; the emergence of a 'new wave' of globalization; obstacles faced by domestic providers in supplying services; a common ambition to become an education services hub for international students; and the scope for greater international cooperation in research. Media services themes include the impact of new technology on content delivery options and associated problems for policy implementation and copyright protection, and the new challenges of globalization for social goals relating to local cultures, as well as risks involved in implementing related policies\"--",

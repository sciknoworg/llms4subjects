            "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as a phenomenon of the twenty-first century with numerous kinds of sensor being developed for specific applications. The origins of WSNs can, however, be traced back to the early days of connectivity between computers and their peripherals. Work with distributed sensor networks is evidenced in the literature during the latter part of the 1970s, continuing in functionality increases in the 1980s and 1990s. As a configuration of independent devices in a data communications network, WSNs are now pre-eminent as working solutions to numerous precision data collection situations where software control of instruments and routing protocols are needed. In this book, the authors have chosen a selection of specific topics relating to WSNs: their design, development, implementation and function. Some operating topics are addressed such as power management, data interchange protocols, instrument reliability and system security. Other topics are more application oriented, where particular hardware and software configurations are described to deliver system solutions for specific needs. All are clearly written with considerable detail relating to each of the issues addressed by the authors. Each of the chapters provides a rationale for the topic being covered and some general WSN details where appropriate. The citations used in the chapters are comprehensively referred to, which adds depth to the information being presented",

            "abstract": "Renewable energy is generally referred to energy that may be renewed. Recently, attention to the use of renewable energy has been increasing, including in Indonesia. Since renewable energy comes from nature and uses natural resources, Indonesia has considerable resources that can potentially be used to produce renewable energy. Responding to this, it is essential to see how renewable energy is utilized, which is discussed in this book.  This book conveys the discussion of renewable energy from the perspective of Indonesia's condition. Chapters in the book address many aspects of new and renewable energy discourse, including technology, policy and regulation, financial strategy, and social aspects. Written by various qualified authors in each field, this book shows how collaboration is much needed in implementing the strategy and policy for the use of new and renewable energy in Indonesia.  Renewable Energy: Policy and Strategy is hoped to be a valuable source of knowledge concerning new and renewable energy solutions. Several recommendations can be implemented, and this book is here to become a reference for policymakers in achieving the target of net zero emissions",

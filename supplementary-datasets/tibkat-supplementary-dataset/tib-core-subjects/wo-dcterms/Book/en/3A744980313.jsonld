            "title": "Distortion Analysis of Analog Integrated Circuits",
            "abstract": "With the increased efforts of the analog design community to integrate analog high-frequency front-ends for telecommunications, there has been heightened interest in the behaviour of nonlinear circuits since this can cause considerable degradation of signals. In analog integrated circuits at lower frequencies, such as filters, nonlinear behaviour limits the dynamic range. Analog integrated circuit designers often lack insight into nonlinear circuit behaviour. Indeed, designers are trained to reason in linear or linearized circuits but not in nonlinear ones. Numerical circuit simulations of nonlinear circuit behavior do not provide enough insight to the designer. Distortion Analysis of Analog Integrated Circuits, with a foreword by Robert G. Meyer, provides both qualitative and quantitative insight into the nonlinear behavior of analog integrated circuits at low and high frequencies. General techniques to suppress nonlinear behavior such as pre-distortion, linear and nonlinear feedback are explained in detail and illustrated with realistic examples. In this way the book fills the gap between the theory of nonlinear systems and practical analog integrated circuits. Distortion Analysis of Analog Integrated Circuits provides the reader with an in-depth analysis of elementary transistor stages, both CMOS and bipolar, as well as an analysis of several larger circuits. Hereby use is made of advanced transistor models that are also discussed in the book. The analyses take into account many more effects than in existing publications, thanks to the use of a calculation method that yields closed-form expressions for nonlinear behavior. These expressions are interpreted and illustrated with realistic numerical examples. Distortion Analysis of Analog Integrated Circuits is essential reading for practicing analog and mixed-signal design engineers and researchers in the field. It is also suitable as a text for an advanced course on the subject. From the foreword: `I am sure that the analog circuit design community will [..] welcome this work by Dr. Wambacq and Prof. Sansen as a major contribution to the analog circuit design literature in the area of distortion analysis of electronic circuits. I am personally looking forward to having a copy readily available for reference when designing integrated circuits for communication systems.' Robert G. Meyer, Professor, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley",

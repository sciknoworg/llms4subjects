            "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) can be defined as systems in which physical objects are represented in the digital world and integrated with computation, storage, and communication capabilities and are connected to each other in a network. The goal in the use of the CPS is integrating the dynamics of the physical processes with those of the software and networking, providing abstractions and modelling, design, and analysis techniques for the integrated whole. The notion of CPS is linked to concepts of robotics and sensor networks with intelligent systems proper of computational intelligence leading the pathway. Recent advances in science and engineering improve the link between computational and physical elements by means of intelligent systems, increasing the adaptability, autonomy, efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability of cyber-physical systems. The potential of cyber-physical systems will spread to several directions, including but not limited to intervention, precision manufacturing, operations in dangerous or inaccessible environments, coordination, efficiency, Maintenance 4.0, and augmentation of human capabilities.Design, Applications, and Maintenance of Cyber-Physical Systems gives insights about CPS as tools for integrating the dynamics of the physical processes with those of software and networking, providing abstractions and modelling, design, and analysis techniques for their smart manufacturing interoperation. The book will have an impact upon the research on robotics, mechatronics, integrated intelligent multibody systems, Industry 4.0, production systems management and maintenance, decision support systems, and Maintenance 4.0. The chapters discuss not only the technologies involved in CPS but also insights into how they are used in various industries. This book is ideal for engineers, practitioners, researchers, academicians, and students who are interested in a deeper understanding of cyber-physical systems (CPS), their design, application, and maintenance, with a special focus on modern technologies in Industry 4.0 and Maintenance 4.0",

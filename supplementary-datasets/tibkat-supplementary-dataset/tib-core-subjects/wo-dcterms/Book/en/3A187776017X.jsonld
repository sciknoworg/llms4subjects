            "abstract": "The \u201cdigital economy\u201d is a conceptual umbrella referring to markets, organizations and their networks that are based on digital technologies, communication, data processing and e-commerce. It is multidimensional and its dynamic structure must be analysed from various dimensions, such as economic \u2013 changes in the nature of resources, production factors and economic processes; technological \u2013 technological progress viewed from a macroeconomic perspective vs. technological innovation viewed from a microeconomic perspective; regulatory \u2013 challenges facing regulators, new risks affecting the institutional order; and sociological \u2013 changes in society\u2019s functioning principles, attitudes towards work and human relations.  The purpose of this book is to analyse the effectiveness of digital technologies as well as the fundamental factors that contribute to technological progress in the long run. It also examines structural and qualitative shifts in economies and societies. It investigates many research questions, such as the gap between the level of digital economic development in European Union countries; digital transformation and its impact on workplace skills development patterns; and also the legal framework for data as resource. The book approaches these issues from a multidisciplinary perspective, from law to economics and sociology. It focuses on definitional discussions, the measurement challenges, drivers for digital transition, the impact on labour relations, digital skills and education, data reuse and data extractivism.  This is a comprehensive introduction to the different contexts from which the digital economy can be addressed, offering an innovative method for studying this complex phenomenon, and as such, it will be a valuable resource for students, scholars and researchers across a range of disciplines",

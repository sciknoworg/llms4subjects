            "abstract": "In a classical approach materials science is mainly dealing with interatomic interactions within molecules, without paying much interest on weak intermolecular interactions. However, the variety of structures actually is the result of weak ordering because of noncovalent interactions. Indeed, for self-assembly to be possible in soft materials, it is evident that forces between molecules must be much weaker than covalent bonds between the atoms of a molecule. The weak intermolecular interactions responsible for molecular ordering in soft materials include hydrogen bonds, coordination bonds in ligands and complexes, ionic and dipolar interactions, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions. Recent evolutions in nanosciences and nanotechnologies provide strong arguments to support the opportunity and importance of the topics approached in this book, the fundamental and applicative aspects related to molecular interactions being of large interest in both research and innovative environments. We expect this book to have a strong impact at various education and research training levels, for young and experienced researchers from both academia and industry",

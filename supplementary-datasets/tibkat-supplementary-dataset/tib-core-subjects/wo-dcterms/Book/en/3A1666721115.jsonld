                "Chapter 1: Does it really matter? Assessing the performance effects of changes in leadership and management structures in Nordic higher education -- Chapter 2: Performance in higher education institutions and its variations in Nordic policy -- Chapter 3: Nordic higher education in flux: system evolution and reform trajectories -- Chapter 4: National performance-based research funding systems: constructing local perceptions of research -- Chapter 5: External research funding and authority relations -- Chapter 6: The changing roles of academic leaders: decision-making, power and performance -- Chapter 7: Strategy as dialogue and engagement -- Chapter 8: Evaluation practices and impact: overload? -- Chapter 9: Governing performance in the Nordic universities: where are we heading and what have we learnt?",
                "This open access book investigates the effects of changes in leadership and managerial structures of Nordic universities resulting from reforms in the last decade. It builds on a rich, comparative dataset across a multiplicity of system-wide (macro) and organisational (meso and micro) dimensions, namely: reform or policy initiatives; drivers, aims, instruments and actors; structural changes within universities; strategic and performance management; the rise of accountability regimes; incentive and evaluative systems; and perceived changes/effects by the key actors involved, at various levels. The volume provides critical insights to the larger phenomenon of change and adaptation within the public sector. Its findings and implications are of relevance to social science researchers, policy makers, managers/administrators, and external stakeholders.

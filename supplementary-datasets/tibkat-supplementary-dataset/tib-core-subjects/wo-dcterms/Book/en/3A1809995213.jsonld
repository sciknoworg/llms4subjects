            "abstract": "\"Emerging Technologies / Life at the Edge of the Future invites us to think forward from our present moment of planetary, public and everyday crisis, through the prism of emerging technologies. It calls for a new ethical, responsible and equitable path towards possible futures, curated through in-depth engagement with and across experiential, environmental and technological possibilities. It tackles three of the most significant challenges for contemporary society by asking: how emerging technologies are implicated in the sites of everyday lives; what is the place of emerging technologies in an evolving world in crisis; and how might we better imagine and shape ethical, equitable and responsible futures. The book interweaves three narratives, each of which advances three sets of concerns for our societal futures: 'Emergence', which addresses futures and uncertainty, trust and anxiety, hope and desire; 'Worlds', which addresses data, air and energy; and 'Technologies', which addresses future mobilities, future homes, and the future of work. Not simply a critical study of emerging technologies, this book is also an approach to thinking and practice in times of global crisis which plays out a mode of future-focused scholarship and practice for the first half of the twenty first century\"--",

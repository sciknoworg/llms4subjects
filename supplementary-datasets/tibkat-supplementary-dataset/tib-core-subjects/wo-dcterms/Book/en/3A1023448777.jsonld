Professor Landstr\u00f6m and Professor Lohrke have carefully selected the seminal, currently relevant and, in many cases, difficult-to-access studies within the field, covering the entrepreneurial processes of opportunity recognition, evaluation and exploitation. Reflecting the heavily interdisciplinary nature of the research, many of the papers have a basis in the spheres of economics, social sciences and strategic management",

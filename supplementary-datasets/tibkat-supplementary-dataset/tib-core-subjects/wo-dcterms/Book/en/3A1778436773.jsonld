            "abstract": "Research into the use of calcium phosphates in the development and clinical application of biomedical materials has been a significantly diverse activity conducted by a wide range of scientists, engineers, and medical practitioners, among others. The field of research in this area can, hence, be truly defined as interdisciplinary, and much interesting work leading to imaginative and innovative solutions for the improvement of health outcomes continues to be generated. It has been the intention of this Special Issue to summarise a number of current topical research advances in this area, as well as to review the important area of calcium phosphate-based biomaterials, namely, composites of hydroxyapatite with carbon-based materials. The scientific papers contained in this Special Issue report on advances in the areas of dental-based materials science, bone cements, use of biomaterials created from natural sources, influences of added agents such as adipose stem cells and statins on bioactivity as well as surface influences on electrical potential of biomaterials and uses of glow discharge methods to remove impurities from biomaterial surfaces",

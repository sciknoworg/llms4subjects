            "abstract": "\"In recent years, a growing interest has emerged in the history of ideas and intellectual discourses of post-war Germany. One of the scholars getting increased attention is the philosopher Joachim Ritter (1903?1974), who taught at the University of M\u00fcnster from 1946 to 1968. This book examines several aspects of the developments in his philosophic thought and its relation to the theories of some of his students. The notable fact that a number of students that attended Ritter?s Collegium Philosophicum became prominent in philosophy, law and politics themselves facilitated debates concerning the importance of this so-called Ritter school (?Ritter-Schule?). But indeed significant philosophical differences appear, not only when comparing the thought of the different participants of Ritter?s Collegium Philosophicum but also in Ritter?s own philosophical considerations from the nineteen-forties to the nineteen-fifties, which may have influenced his students of that time.Considering these developments and Ritter?s former students? different approaches to adopting his thought, this book focuses on two main aspects. On the one hand it analyzes considerations concerning the relation of religion and modern society on the part of the respective scholars, and on the other hand it puts emphasis on authors like Ernst-Wolfgang B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde, Hermann L\u00fcbbe, Odo Marquard, and Robert Spaemann. They were, among others, participants of Ritter?s Collegium Philosophicum and involved in public debates on politics and religion, to some extent up to the present time. The differences among their philosophical positions question the supposed homogeneity of the so-called Ritter school and its common ground. Thus these differences reveal ambivalent modes of reception of Ritter?s philosophy, while at the same time indicating ambivalences inherent in Ritter?s own philosophy.Following the introduction and a section that presents the history of Ritter?s Collegium Philosophicum at M\u00fcnster and the discussion concerning the so-called Ritter school in general, chapters 3 and 4 attend to the main issues of this study. At the beginning of Ritter?s philosophic involvement with modern society, in the late forties, there is a questioning perspective towards his time, a critique of modernity reflecting the disastrous consequences of the war and the Nazi regime as well as the precarious prospects of the beginning cold war. Section 3.1 takes a closer look at how it was possible for Ritter to come up wit ...",

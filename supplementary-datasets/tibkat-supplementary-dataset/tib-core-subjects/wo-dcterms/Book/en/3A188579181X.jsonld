            "abstract": "The chapters in this book explore the methods by which the many aspects of creative pedagogy might be implemented in the context of teaching and learning. One chapter proposes a creative approach to studying local history, while another suggests a pedagogical framework for coding education that has the potential to foster the development of creative thinking abilities and equip individuals to actively participate in global affairs. The utilization of case studies in the field of Citizen Science demonstrates the implementation of a comprehensive and innovative learning framework that incorporates several sensory modalities. Another chapter demonstrates the potential of maker spaces in fostering active and creative learning as well as enhancing student engagement among underrepresented and minority populations. One chapter explores the emergence of flow in STEAM activities as a means to promote heightened levels of comprehension and active engagement in science education. The book concludes with the presentation of two scholarly studies on the implementation of creative pedagogy within the context of Higher Education. The first study explores the advantages of collaborative creativity within the bachelor of social work programs. The second delves into the pursuit of an innovative design that effectively connects the curriculum with the work environment, resulting in the integration of valuable educational content inside professional settings",

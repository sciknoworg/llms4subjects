                "This book gives an update on recent developments in different engineering disciplines such as mechanical, materials, computer and process engineering, focusing on modern engineering design applications. These disciplines provide the foundation for the design and development of improved structures, materials and processes. The modern design cycle is characterized by an interaction of different disciplines and a strong shift to computer-based approaches where only a few experiments are performed for verification purposes. A major driver for this development is the increased demand for cost reduction, which is also connected to environmental demands. In the transportation industry (e.g., automotive), this is connected to the demand for higher fuel efficiency, which is related to the operational costs and the lower harm for the environment. One way to fulfill such requirements is lighter structures and/or improved processes for energy conversion. Another emerging area is the interaction of classical engineering with the health, medical and environmental sector. The chapters are selected contributions of the Advanced Computational Engineering and Experimenting conference, held in July 2022 in Florence, Italy.",

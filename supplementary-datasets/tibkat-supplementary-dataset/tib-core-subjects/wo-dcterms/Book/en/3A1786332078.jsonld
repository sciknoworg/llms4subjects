                "This book undertakes an in-depth examination of the dynamics of commitment in U.S.-Southeast Asia strategy. Drawing on cases including the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam and Washington\u2019s pivot to Asia amid China\u2019s growing regional role, it constructs an original balance of commitment model to explain continuity and change in U.S.-Southeast Asia policy. Balance of commitment goes beyond balance of power approaches to explains how translating Southeast Asia\u2019s importance in U.S. thinking into actual commitments has proven challenging for policymakers as it requires simultaneously calibrating adjustments to power shifts, threat perceptions and resource extraction. The book applies the balance of commitment approach to several practical case studies, based on hundreds of conversations with policymakers and experts in the United States and Southeast Asia, personal experiences across nearly two decades and primary and secondary source material across a half-century. The findings suggest that the challenges of U.S. commitment to the region are rooted not simply in differences between administrations or divergences in outlook between Washington and regional capitals, but tough balancing acts for U.S. policymakers in domestic politics and wider foreign policy. As such, shaping U.S. strategy in Southeast Asia and calibrating and sustaining commitment requires not just appreciating Southeast Asia\u2019s significance, but committing to the region in ways that manage structural aspects of U.S. thinking, capabilities and resourcing. Dr. Prashanth Parameswaran is an analyst and educator focused on Southeast Asia, politics and security issues in the Asia-Pacific and U.S. foreign policy in the region. He is currently a fellow at the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars based in Washington, D.C. and a senior columnist at The Diplomat, one of Asia\u2019s leading current affairs magazines. A political scientist by training, he has previously held roles linked to think tanks, media, business, and government, conducting field research, consulting, writing and teaching on these issues for nearly two decades and widely publishing policy insights, research and commentary in the United States and in Southeast Asia. ."

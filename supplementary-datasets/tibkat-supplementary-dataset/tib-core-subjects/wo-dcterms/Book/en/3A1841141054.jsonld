            "abstract": "Seen through the distilling lens of the architectural model, Architecture\u2019s Model Environments is a novel and far-reaching exploration of the many dialogues buildings have with their environmental surroundings. Expanding on histories of building technology, the book sheds new light on how physical models conventionally understood as engineering experimentation devices enable architectural design speculation.  The book begins with a catalogue of ten original model prototypes \u2013 of wind tunnels, water tables and filling boxes \u2013 and is the first of its kind to establish an architectural approach to fabricating such environmental models. Subsequent chapters feature three precedent models that have been largely overlooked within the wider oeuvres of their authors: French polymath \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey\u2019s 1900-2 wind tunnels, Hungarian-American architects Victor and Alad\u00e1r Olgyay\u2019s 1955-63 thermoheliodon, and Scottish chemist and building ventilation expert David Boswell \u2018The Ventilator\u2019 Reid\u2019s 1844 test tube convection experiments.  Moving between historic moments and the present day, between case studies and original prototypes, the book reveals the potent ability for models, as both physical artefacts and mental ideals, to reflect prevailing cultural views about the world and to even reshape those views. Fundamentally, Architecture\u2019s Model Environments illustrates how environmental models reveal design insights across scales from the seam (that leaks) to the body (that feels) to the building (that mediates) to the world (that immerses)",

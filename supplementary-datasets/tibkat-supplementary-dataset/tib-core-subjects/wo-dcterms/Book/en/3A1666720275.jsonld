                "This open access book is based on selected presentations from Topic Study Group 21: Mathematical Applications and Modelling in the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics at the 13th International Congress on Mathematical Education (ICME 13), held in Hamburg, Germany on July 24\u201331, 2016. It contributes to the theory, research and teaching practice concerning this key topic by taking into account the importance of relations between mathematics and the real world. Further, the book addresses the \u201cbalancing act\u201d between developing students\u2019 modelling skills on the one hand, and using modelling to help them learn mathematics on the other, which arises from the integration of modelling into classrooms. The contributions, prepared by authors from 9 countries, reflect the spectrum of international debates on the topic, and the examples presented span schooling from years 1 to 12, teacher education, and teaching modelling at the tertiary level. In addition the book highlights professional learning and development for in-service teachers, particularly in systems where the introduction of modelling into curricula means reassessing how mathematics is taught. Given its scope, the book will appeal to researchers and teacher educators in mathematics education, as well as pre-service teachers and school and university educators",

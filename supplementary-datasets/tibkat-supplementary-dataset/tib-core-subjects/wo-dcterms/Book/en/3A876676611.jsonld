                "Electrical Engineering High-Power Microwave Sources and Technologies A volume in the IEEE Press Series on RF and Microwave Technology Roger D. Pollard and Richard Booton, Series Editors Written by a prolific group of leading researchers, High-Power Microwave Sources and Technologies focuses primarily on the high-power microwave (HPM) technology most appropriate for military applications. It highlights the advances achieved from 1995 to 2000 as the result of a US Department of Defense (DoD) funded, $15 million Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) program. The grant created a synergy between researchers in the DoD laboratories and the academic community, and established links with the microwave vacuum electronics industry, which has led to unprecedented collaborations that transcend laboratory and disciplinary boundaries. This essential reference provides the history, state-of-the-art, and possible future of HPM source research and technologies. The first alternative to the multiplicity of detailed applications-based HPM books and journal articles, this book familiarizes the reader with recent advances in this rapidly changing field. It presents a compendium of valuable information on HPM sources, representing significant enabling technologies, including beam and rf control, cathodes, windows, and computational techniques. The era of utilizing computational techniques to electronically design an HPM source prior to actually building the hardware has arrived. Gain insight into proven techniques and solutions that will enhance your source design. High-Power Microwave Sources and Technologies is an invaluable resource to researchers active in the field, faculty, graduate and post-graduate students. Special Note: All royalties realized from the sale of this book will fund the future research and publications activities of graduate students in the HPM field"

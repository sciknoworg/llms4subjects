                "In order to analyze how transformative musical works are culturally understood, this book examines how mainstream press discourse talks about them. According to professional journalistic norms, press discussion is supposed to be neutral and balanced. This is, of course, a fiction, because press is to study social power relations, this is a benefit, not a drawback. In particular, norms of explaining \"both sides\" of an issue mean that a cross section of mainstream thought is available in the press, at the same time that more marginal perspectives are systematically excluded. Moreover, in addition to conveying what the journalist perceives to be a neutral account of a situation, the press helps frame public understanding of issues, thus contributing to making this the default understanding through presenting a hegemonic view as the truth. For these reasons, Stanfill uses press coverage to examine social beliefs circulating widely about transformative musical works. In doing so, she specifically abstracts away from particular journalists and their identities (racial, gender, or others) because, by those same professional norms, individual perspectives are supposed to be suppressed in the name of a (white and masculine) construct of universality. Moreover, an individual journalist presenting an opinion (whether they are aware of doing so or not) is not in itself meaningful, but when there are patterns in opinions across multiple articles, by different people, in different locations and at different moments, they become suggestive of a broader hegemonic formation",
                "Any and all songs are capable of being remixed. But not all remixes are treated equally. Rock This Way examines transformative musical works\u2014cover songs, remixes, mash-ups, parodies, and soundalike songs\u2014to discover what contemporary American culture sees as legitimate when it comes to making music that builds upon other songs. Through examples of how popular discussion talked about such songs between 2009 and 2018, Mel Stanfill uses a combination of discourse analysis and digital humanities methods to interrogate our broader understanding of transformative works and where they converge at the legal, economic, and cultural ownership levels.   Rock This Way provides a new way of thinking about what it means to re-create and borrow music, how the racial identity of both the reusing artist and the reused artist matters, and the ways in which the law polices artists and their works. Ultimately, Stanfill demonstrates that the extent to which a work is seen as having new expression or meaning is contingent upon notions of creativity, legitimacy, and law, all of which are shaped by white supremacy"

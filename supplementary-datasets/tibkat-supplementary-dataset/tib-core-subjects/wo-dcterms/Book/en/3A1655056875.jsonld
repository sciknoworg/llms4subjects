                "The second volume of the series on inorganic biochemistry and bio\u00ad physics is singularly devoted to magnetic resonance on systems of high molecular complexity. Recently, there have been important advances in magnetic resonance studies of polymers; these advances touch on all aspects of magnetic resonance, both theoretical and applied. Particular emphasis is placed here on multipulse experiments. We believe such an report will be of considerable interest to the readers of our series owing to the importance of magnetic resonance techniques in the investigation of biopolymers. Ivano Bertini Harry Gray Series Editors Preface This book is a record of the Proceedings of the International Symposium on \"Advanced Magnetic Resonance Techniques in Systems of High Molecular Complexity\", which was held in Siena between 15 and 18 May 1985. The idea of the meeting is due to Proff. N.M. Atherton, G. Giacometti and E. Tiezzi with the aim of honouring the scientific personality of Prof. S.I. Weissman. The meeting has been organized with the assistance of a National Committee formed by R. Basosi, I. Bertini, P. Bucci, C. Corvaia, A. Gamba, G. Martini, G.F. Pedulli, P.A. Temussi, and C.A. Veracini. The invited lecturers responded enthusiastically and a comprehensive picture of the theoretical and practical aspects of magnetic resonance could be therefore provided. The book contains all the plenary lectures delivered during the meeting and also a wide selection among the huge amount of contributions collected by the organizers."

            "abstract": "\"VLSI devices down scaling is a very significant part of the design to improve the performance of VLSI industry outcomes, which results in high speed and low power of operation of integrated devices. The increasing use of VLSI circuits dealing with highly sensitive information such as health care, adequate security measures are required to be taken for the secure storage and transmission. Advanced Circuits and Systems for Healthcare and Security Applications provides broader coverage of the basic aspects of advanced circuits and security, and introduce the corresponding principles. By the end of this book, you will be familiarized with the theoretical frameworks, technical methodologies, and empirical research findings in the field to protect your computers and information from adversaries. Advanced circuits and comprehensive material of this book will keep you interested and involved throughout. The book is an integrated source which aims at understanding the basic concepts associated with the security of the advanced circuits and the cyber world as a first step towards achieving high end protection from the adversaries and the hackers. The content includes theoretical frameworks and recent empirical findings in the field to understand the associated principles, key challenges and recent real-time applications of the advanced circuits and cyber security. It illustrates the notions, models and terminologies that are widely used in the area of circuits, security, identifies the existing security issues in the field, and evaluates the underlying factors that influence the security of the systems. It emphasizes the idea of understanding the motivation of the attackers to establish the adequate security measures and to mitigate the security attacks in a better way. This book also outlines the exciting areas of future research where the already existing methodologies can be implemented. Moreover, this book is suitable for students, researchers, and professionals who are looking forward to carrying out research in the field of Advanced Circuits and Systems for Healthcare and Security Applications, faculty members across the universities and software developers\"--",

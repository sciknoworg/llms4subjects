            "abstract": "The book \"Echocardiography - In Specific Diseases\" brings together contributions from well- known researchers from around the world, some of them specialized in imaging science in their clinical orientation, but also representatives from academic medical centers. Each chapter is structured and written to be accessible to those with a basic knowledge of echocardiography but also to be stimulating and informative to experts and researchers in the field of echocardiography. This book is primarily aimed at cardiology fellows during their basic echocardiography rotation, fellows of internal medicine, radiology and emergency medicine, but also experts in echocardiography. During the past few decades technological advancements in echocardiography have been developing rapidly, leading to improved echocardiographic imaging using new techniques. The authors of this book tried to explain the role of echocardiography in several special pathologies, which the readers may find in different chapters of the book",

            "abstract": "This is the first book presenting the relation between coffee producers and consumers of coffee beverages, at marketing management level. Many books offer advice on how to write effective marketing strategies, but only few indicate how to implement them successfully. This book belongs to the second group. The proposed solutions can be applied by coffee producers, but can also be adapted to suit the needs of enterprises operating on other markets. The actual needs of the clients are presented, and the authors show how to implement and control the adopted marketing strategies to satisfy those needs. Valuable assets this book offers are the control system for the execution of the marketing strategy proposed by the authors (based on the Balanced Scorecard), and the aggregate of 38 indicators enabling you to determine the degree of implementation of the marketing strategy adopted by the enterprise. 'The main idea of the monograph is the effort to improve the activities of coffee producers by analysing and eliminating the discrepancy between the marketing strategies used and the real needs and preferences of consumers. The monograph is based on primary and secondary data obtained as a result of surveys of consumers and participants of the supply side of the coffee market. The conclusions presented in the monograph are drawn from the analysis of documents of twenty-six coffee producers, individual in-depth interviews with managers, a case study of the company MOKATE sp. z o.o. - the leader of the Polish instant cappuccino market, and from direct interviews with 800 coffee consumers. The Polish coffee market is one of the largest markets of this kind in Europe and it has great potential for growth. Therefore, this publication is not only a valuable contribution to research on behaviour of market entities, but also an important source of inspiration for managers responsible for everyday marketing in FMCG markets, in particular, in coffee markets.' Prof. Roman E. Niestr\u00f3j Professor of Marketing, WSB University, Poland 'This book describes possible marketing strategies with focus on the coffee sector. The history of 'marketing' is presented, from the first attempts at a scientific approach in 1926, up to the establishment of this term in science in the 1950s. The authors refer to various definitions of marketing and describe its strategy variants (defensive/active). The main element (and advantage) of the book is the presentation of various methods of implementation and (equally important) their control. This content is supplemented by tables and figures concerning production, consumption and prices in the coffee market. In general, the book has a significant practical value, as it shows enterprises (not only from the coffee sector) how to effectively implement marketing strategies.'

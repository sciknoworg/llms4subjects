            "abstract": "The second edition of Multi-Objective Management in Freight Logistics builds upon the first, providing a detailed study of freight transportation systems, with a specific focus on multi-objective modelling. It offers decision-makers methods and tools for implementing multi-objective optimisation models in logistics. The second edition also includes brand-new chapters on green supply chain and hybrid fleet management problems. After presenting the general framework and multi-objective optimization, the book analyses green logistic focusing on two main aspects: green corridors and network design; next, it studies logistic issues in a maritime terminal and route planning in the context of hazardous material transportation. Finally, heterogeneous fleets distribution and coordination models are discussed. The book presents problems providing the mathematics, algorithms, implementations, and the related experiments for each problem. It offers a valuable resource for postgraduate students and researchers in transportation, logistics and operations, as well as practitioners working in service systems.",

            "abstract": [
                "This book addresses critical aspects of the nationalization of labour markets in the Gulf countries. It examines the role of higher education institutions in providing the market with the right skills that are most needed in the era of the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0). The book also explores the new dynamics of technology and information systems in upgrading the skills, changing the work environment, and generating employment for the youth in the Gulf countries. The holistic approach of the subject area makes this volume indispensable to academics, researchers, students, and policy makers in the Gulf region and beyond. The book covers a broad range of topics including the nationalization of labour market programmes such as Emiratization and Saudization, attitudes toward women in workplace, the role of high-tech firms in upskilling and enhancing the productivity of workforce, while also providing sector-specific investigations in healthcare, banking, finance, tourism, and hospitality. The analysis is based on original research and primary data collected by a group of scholars from 15 countries and presented in an illustrative, accessible, and concise manner. Ashraf Mishrif is Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chair in Economic Studies at Sultan Qaboos University. Prior to that, he was Associate Professor at King\u2019s College London and has taught in several universities including Qatar University, Anglia Ruskin University (Cambridge) and University of Greenwich in London. Magdalena Karolak is Associate Professor of Humanities and Social Sciences at Zayed University, UAE. Prior to working at Zayed University, Dr. Karolak held Assistant Professor positions in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. She holds PhD in a linguistics.

In 2021 he launched a new pre-service teaching diploma with 4 public universities. .",

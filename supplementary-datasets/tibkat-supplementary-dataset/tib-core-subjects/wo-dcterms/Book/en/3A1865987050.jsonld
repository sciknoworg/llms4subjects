            "abstract": "The response of the government of the Republic of Korea to COVID-19 has been heralded as among the most successful. In the first two years of the pandemic, the government was able to keep the size of the outbreak relatively small and the death toll relatively low. Although the number of COVID-19 cases jumped significantly subsequently in 2022 and 2023 due to the spread of the more transmissible Omicron variant and a revamped testing regime that cast a broader net to detect infections, Korea had a much lower rate of total confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million population than other high income countries (676 in Korea, as compared to 3,379 in the United Kingdom, 3,331 in the United States, and 2,599 in France). The government achieved this relatively positive result without resorting to the highly restrictive measures that were adopted by most high-income countries, such as strictly controlling borders, shuttering businesses, or issuing severe lockdown or stay-at-home orders. Indeed, since the start of the outbreak in January 2020, the distinguishing features of the response in Korea include the government's ability to mobilize swiftly, even in the early stages of the pandemic, to flatten the epidemic curve. This report dissects the COVID-19 countermeasures successfully adopted in Korea. The analysis draws out insights and lessons that may be relevant to other countries as they mount responses to ongoing crises and prepare for future public health emergencies",

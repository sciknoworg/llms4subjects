            "abstract": "\"Theory of Machines and Mechanisms Uniquely comprehensive and precise, this thoroughly updated sixth edition of the well-established and respected textbook is ideal for the complete study of the kinematics and dynamics of machines. With a strong emphasis on intuitive graphical methods, and accessible approaches to vector analysis, students are given all the essential background, notation, and nomenclature needed to understand the various independent technical approaches that exist in the field of mechanisms, kinematics, and dynamics, which are presented with clarity and coherence. This revised edition features updated coverage, and new worked examples alongside over 840 figures, over 620 end-of-chapter problems, and a solutions manual for instructors. John J. Uicker is a Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A pioneering researcher on matrix methods of linkage analysis, he was the first to derive the general dynamic equations of motion for rigid-body articulated mechanical systems. He served on several national committees of ASME and SAE. John was a founding member of the U.S. Council for the Theory of Machines and Mechanisms, and served as Editor-in-Chief of the federation journal Mechanism and Machine Theory. Gordon R. Pennock is an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University. He is a member of the Commission on Standards and Terminology, the International Federation for the Theory of Machines and Mechanisms. He has also served as the Technical Committee Chairman of Mechanical Design, Internal Combustion Engine Division, and Chairman of the Mechanisms and Robotics Committee, ASME. Gordon is a Fellow of ASME, a Fellow of SAE, and a Fellow and Chartered Engineer of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, United Kingdom. Joseph E. Shigley (deceased May 1994) was a Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan and a Fellow of ASME. He received the Mechanisms Committee Award in 1974, the Worcester Reed Warner medal in 1977, and the Machine Design Award in 1985. He was author of eight books, including Mechanical Engineering Design (with Charles R. Mischke) and Applied Mechanics of Materials, and was co-editor-in-chief of the Standard Handbook of Machine Design\"--",

            "title": "Annotations to Geoffrey Hill's Speech! Speech!",
            "abstract": "Geoffrey Hill\u2019s Speech! Speech! (2000) encapsulates two thousand years\u2019 worth of utterances in a symbolic act of remembrance and expression of despair for the current age, in which we find \u201cour minds and ears fouled by degraded public speech\u2014by media hype, insipid sermons, hollow political rhetoric, and the ritual misuse of words.\u201d Through 120 densely allusive stanzas\u2014\u201cAs many as the days that were | of SODOM\u201d\u2014the poem wrestles this condition from within, fighting fire with fire in an alchemical symbolic labour that transmutes the dross of corrupt and clich\u00e9d idiom into a dynamic logopoeia which proves true Hill\u2019s persistent claim: \u201cgenuinely difficult art is truly democratic.\u201d Such is the weird, ambivalently hostile position of poetry in the present world and thus the space of our real connection to it: \u201cWhatever strange relationship we have with the poem, it is not one of enjoyment. It is more like being brushed past, or aside, by an alien being\u201d (Hill).  Befriending this estrangement, embracing it as a more amicable brushing-up-against, Hassan\u2019s Annotations is a thorough and patient explication of Speech! Speech! that both clarifies and deepens the poem\u2019s difficulties, illuminating its polyphonic language and careening discursive movement. The author\u2019s method is at once commentarial, descriptive, and narratorial, staying faithfully with the poem and following its complex verbal and logical turns. The book generously provides, rather than direct interpretative incursion, a more durable and productive document of \u201cthe true nature / of this achievement\u201d (stanza 92), a capacious, open understanding of the text that will prove invaluable to its present and future readers",

                "This book gathers the papers presented at the XXIX International Congress INGEGRAF \u201cThe digital transformation in graphic engineering,\u201d which was held in Logro\u00f1o, Spain on June 20\u201321, 2019. It reports on cutting-edge topics in product design and manufacturing, such as industrial methods for integrated product and process design; innovative design; and computer-aided design. Further topics covered include virtual simulation and reverse engineering; additive manufacturing; product manufacturing; engineering methods in medicine and education; representation techniques; and design and modeling for nautical, engineering and construction, aeronautics and aerospace contexts. The book is divided into six main sections, reflecting the focus and primary themes of the conference. The contributions presented here will not only provide researchers, engineers and experts in a range of industrial engineering subfields with extensive information to support them in their daily work, but will also stimulate new research directions, advanced applications of the methods discussed, and future interdisciplinary collaborations."

                "The potential benefits of 'doing things more precisely' in agriculture include terms such as environmental, economic, audit trail, vehicle guidance, crop management and others. Whilst some benefits have proved elusive, others are contributing positively to today's agriculture. In such an environment, continuing research is required - and needs to be reported and disseminated to a wide audience. These Proceedings contain papers presented at the 5th European Conference on Precision Agriculture, held in Uppsala, Sweden. The papers reflect the wide range of disciplines that impinge on precision agriculture - technology, crop science, soil science, agronomy, information technology, decision support, remote sensing and others. Peer-reviewed papers from the 2nd European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming are presented in a companion proceedings, Precision Livestock Farming '05",

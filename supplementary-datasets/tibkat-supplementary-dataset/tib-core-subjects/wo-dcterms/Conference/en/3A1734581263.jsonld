            "abstract": "Digital design and manufacturing has been considered, over the last decade, as a highly promising set of technologies for reducing product development times as well as for addressing the need for customization, increased product quality, and faster response to the market. To solve some complex manufacturing problems and perform larger-scale effective manufacturing, the impediments to practical application and development of digital designing and manufacture technology were discussed in this book such as applied materials , applied and computational mechanics, researching and designing in mechanical engineering ,mechatronics, control and automation and so on. It has become the most important techniques to enhance their competitiveness to win advantage in the market. At the same time, it has a huge potential for development and improvement. This volume contains selected papers from 2014 Global Conference on Digital Design and Manufacturing Technology (2014 DDMTC) which was held during November 27-29,2014,in Hanzhong Shaanxi Prov., P.R. China. Keyword: applied materials, applied and computational mechanics, researching and designing in mechanical engineering, mechatronics, control and automation Contains 37 peer-reviewed papers from the 2014 Digital Design and Manufacturing Technology Conference, which was held in China. All of the contributors are connected to Chinese universities, laboratories or research facilities. The papers are highly technical. A few of the titles are: Experimental Investigation on Thermophysical Performance of BN/EG Nanofluids Influenced by Dispersant; Analysis of High Pressure Gas Cylinder Preload of Screw Connection; Mesh Dynamics Analysis of Gear Shaving Cutter Research Based on ADAMS software; and A Probabilistic Safety Assessment Method Based on Latin Hypercube Sampling Method. Much of the English translation needs clarification. \u2014 Classical Mechanics\u2014 Engineering\u2014 Materials Science",

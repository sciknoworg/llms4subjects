            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).High-nitrogen steels (HNS) are finding increased application in energy production, transportation, pulp and paper, oil and gas and chemical process industries, due to their outstanding mechanical properties as well as their corrosion/oxidation and wear resistance. The aim of this conference was to bring together experts from end-users (engineering and manufacturing companies), and participants from steel producers and research organizations, in order to exchange experience, scientific data and technical information regarding high-nitrogen steels. The main topics of discussion included: Atomic Interactions and Kinetics, Thermodynamics and Phase Transformations, Service and Applications, Alloy Development, Microstructure and Melting, Mechanical Properties, Corrosion, Welding, Powder Metallurgy and Mechanical Alloying, Wear, Physical Properties, Hot- and Cold-Working and Duplex Stainless Steels.Contents Sections:1. Atomic Interactions and Kinetics. 2. Thermodynamics and Phase Transformations. 3. Service and Applications. 4. Alloy Development. 5. Microstructure and Melting. 6. Mechanical Properties. 7. Corrosion. 8. Welding. 9. Powder Metallurgy and Mechanical Alloying. 10. Wear, Physical Properties, Hot and Cold Working and Duplex Steels. Representatives from steel producers, research organizations, and end users such as engineering and manufacturing companies share experience, scientific data, and technical information on a family of steels that are finding increased application in energy production, transportation, pulp and paper, oil and gas, and chemical process industries because of their unique mechanical properties and their resistance to corrosion, oxidation, and wear. Some 120 papers discuss atomic interactions and kinetics, thermodynamics and phase transformations, service and applications, alloy development, microstructure and melting, mechanical properties, corrosion, welding, powder metallurgy and mechanical alloying, wear, physical properties, and hot-working and cold-working and duplex stainless steels",

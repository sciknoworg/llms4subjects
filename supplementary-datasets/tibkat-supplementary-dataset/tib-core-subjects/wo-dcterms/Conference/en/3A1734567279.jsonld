            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This work brings together peer-reviewed papers on innovations and practical suggestions with regard to engineering & technology; materials science and technology in manufacturing including artificial materials, forming, novel-material fabrication, green manufacturing, design and manufacturing of composite components, surface science and engineering, quality control of manufacturing systems, theoretical, simulation and experimental studies related to microstructures and residual stresses; manufacturing systems and technologies including manufacturing process simulation, CIMS and manufacturing systems, vibration measuring and reliability analysis, finite element analysis and structure optimization, fault diagnosis and maintenance theory, intelligent mechatronics and robotics, elements, structures, mechanisms, and applications of micro and nano systems, compound machine tools, rapid prototyping, printing (e.g. embossing), complex mechanical-electro-liquid systems, PDM, ERP, CRM, FMS, PLM, logistics and supply chains, effect of the machining method or technique upon resultant material mechanical properties, RPM, and management. This work will be invaluable to production and research engineers, to research students and to academics interested in these fields. Some 150 peer-reviewed papers discuss innovations in functional manufacturing that might interest production and research engineers, and research students and academics in these fields. Among their topics are an online monitoring system for micro-hole drilling based on rough set fuzzy control, the effect of input shaping on actuator effort of inertial plants, a new algorithm for the normal adjustment of point cloud, calibration methods of a planar parallel robot, high-performance heat-insulated coating fabric and its production technology, the effect of process parameters on strain rates in laser shock forming, the effect of carbon nano-tubes on the properties of natural rubber composites, and analyzing yarn tension in a typical carpet tufting equipment system",

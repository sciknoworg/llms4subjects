            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The peer-reviewed contents cover the subjects of environmental chemistry and biology, environmental materials, environmental safety and health, environmental planning and assessment, environmental analysis and monitoring, environmental engineering, pollution control (air, water, solid), waste disposal and recycling, water supply and drainage engineering, noise and vibration control, clean production processes, hydrology and water resources engineering, soil and water conservation and desertification control, environmental protection, plant protection, and land resources environment and urban planning. This extensive coverage makes the work a veritable handbook.  This five-volume set offers peer-reviewed papers from an October 2011 conference, written by contributors in academia and industry. Main themes are renewable and sustainable energy, power and electrical engineering, environmental science and engineering, and natural resources and sustainable development. Part 1 groups papers in sections on environmental chemistry and biology, and environmental materials. Part 2 presents work on environmental safety and health, environmental planning and assessment, environmental analysis and monitoring, and environmental engineering. Part 3 presents papers on pollution control, and Part 4 contains sections on waste disposal and recycling, water supply and drainage engineering, noise and vibration control, and hydrology and water resources engineering. Part 5 offers work on soil and water conservation and control of desertification, environmental protection, plant protection, geographic information and remote sensing science, and urban planning. The editor is affiliated with Shanghai University of Electric Power, China",

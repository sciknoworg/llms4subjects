                "This book gathers peer-reviewed contributions submitted to the 21st European Conference on Mathematics for Industry, ECMI 2021, which was virtually held online, hosted by the University of Wuppertal, Germany, from April 13th to April 15th, 2021. The works explore mathematics in a wide variety of applications, ranging from problems in electronics, energy and the environment, to mechanics and mechatronics. Topics covered include: Applied Physics, Biology and Medicine, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Economics, Finance and Insurance, Energy, Production Systems, Social Challenges, and Vehicles and Transportation. The goal of the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry (ECMI) conference series is to promote interaction between academia and industry, leading to innovations in both fields. These events have attracted leading experts from business, science and academia, and have promoted the application of novel mathematical technologies to industry. They have also encouraged industrial sectors to share challenging problems where mathematicians can provide fresh insights and perspectives. Lastly, the ECMI conferences are one of the main forums in which significant advances in industrial mathematics are presented, bringing together prominent figures from business, science and academia to promote the use of innovative mathematics in industry.",

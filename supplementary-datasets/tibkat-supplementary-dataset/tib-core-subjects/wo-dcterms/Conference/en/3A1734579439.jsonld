The 131 papers are grouped as follows: Chapter 1: Materials Sciences and Materials Processing, Chapter 2: Control Engineering, Chapter 3: Artificial Intelligence, Intelligence Automation, Information Technology and Software Applications, Chapter 4: Data Mining and Processing, Data Acquisition, Signal Processing, Algorithms,Chapter 5: Networks Engineering, Networks Security and Control, Chapter 6: Innovative Design Technologies, Modelling, Simulation and Numerical Methods in Manufacturing, Chapter 7: Power and Electronics Systems, Energy and Electric Vehicles Applications, Chapter 8: Building and Construction Engineering, Structure Stability, Eco and Environmental Applications, Chapter 9: Innovate Technologies in Management and Logistics Keyword:Materials Sciences and Materials Processing; Control Engineering; Artificial Intelligence, Intelligence Automation, Information Technology and Software Applications; Data Mining and Processing, Data Acquisition, Signal Processing, Algorithms; Networks Engineering, Networks Security and Control; Innovative Design Technologies, Modelling, Simulation and Numerical Methods in Manufacturing; Power and Electronics Systems, Energy and Electric Vehicles Applications; Building and Construction Engineering, Structure Stability, Eco and Environmental Applications; Innovate Technologies in Management and Logistics Editor Wongseedakaew presents this thick collection of papers from the 5th International Conference on Information Technology for Manufacturing Systems (ITMS 2014). The first section presents contributions on manufacturing, processing, and characterization of special materials including alloys and ceramics, while the next two discuss control engineering, artificial intelligence, and automated systems. Data acquisition, mining, and processing and algorithmic methods are treated followed by network engineering problems, including security, as well as a section on modeling and simulation technologies. The ending chapters focus on specific arenas of application such as electronics, energy, environmentally friendly construction, and management. \u2014 Computer science -- Elements and architecture\u2014 Engineering\u2014 Information science\u2014 Materials science",

                "This book of Advances in Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (proceedings of ICDLAIR 2020) is intended to be used as a reference by students and researchers who collect scientific and technical contributions with respect to models, tools, technologies and applications in the field of modern artificial intelligence and robotics. Deep Learning, AI and robotics represent key ingredients for the 4th Industrial Revolution. Their extensive application is dramatically changing products and services, with a large impact on labour, economy and society at all. The research and reports of new technologies and applications in DL, AI and robotics like biometric recognition systems, medical diagnosis, industries, telecommunications, AI petri nets model-based diagnosis, gaming, stock trading, intelligent aerospace systems, robot control and web intelligence aim to bridge the gap between these non-coherent disciplines of knowledge and fosters unified development in next-generation computational models for machine intelligence."

            "abstract": "This specialist book, the first of its kind, includes original and review articles which describe magnetic shape-memory alloys and the magnetic shape-memory effect. These topics are currently the object of world-wide research and development. In particular, the authors in the present book concentrated upon describing the phenomenological and microscopic mechanisms of the magnetic shape-memory effect, on the physical basis of the advanced properties of magnetic shape-memory alloys and on the structural aspects of martensitic transformations in both ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic shape-memory alloys. Several chapters are devoted to more general issues such as damping, the newly-discovered glassy martensite and modeling. The reader will also find copious information on technical applications and actuators which utilize shape-memory alloys with due consideration given to the relevant design principles and the analysis of simulation results.This book will therefore be of great interest to anyone working on the research or development aspects of smart materials. Chernenko (Institute of Magnetism, Kyiv, Ukraine) presents a collection of 16 reviews and original articles covering \"hot\" topics in research and development in the materials science of magnetic shape memory. The 16 invited papers, written by some 70 international academics and researchers, cover a range of topics including the phenomenological and microscopic mechanisms of the magnetic shape-memory effect, the physical bases of advanced properties of magnetic shape memory alloys, the structural aspects of martensitic transformations in both ferromagnetic and non- ferromagnetic shape memory alloys, technical applications and actuators utilizing shape memory alloys with considerations on their design principles and discussion of simulation results, as well as general issues such as damping, newly-discovered glassy martensite and modeling. For physicists and materials scientists and graduate students concerned with the research or development aspects of smart materials",

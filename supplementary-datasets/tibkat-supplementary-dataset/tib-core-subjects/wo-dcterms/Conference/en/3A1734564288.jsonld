            "abstract": "This work comprises a selection chosen from among more than 300 authoritative submitted papers. All of the papers were submitted for peer-review by at least two expert referees.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The 117 papers selected for this volume were chosen for their particularly good quality and their relevance to the topic in question. The resultant contents bring, to the reader, the most recent advances made in the field of abrasive technology: including the mechanics and control of abrasive processes, modeling and simulation of abrasive processes, measurement and surface-quality assessment, cooling and coolants, polishing, wheel-truing and dressing, novel abrasive techniques and novel machining techniques. The book will therefore be invaluable to production and research engineers, research students and academics working in this field. This work contains selected papers from an October 2007 conference held in China, detailing recent advances in the field of abrasive technology, including the mechanics and control of abrasive processes, modeling and simulation of abrasive processes, measurement and surface quality assessment, cooling and coolants, polishing, wheel truing and dressing, novel abrasive techniques, and novel machining techniques. The book will be of value to production and research engineers, students, and academics. Some specific topics examined include tribological performance of fine-grained diamond films, a high-speed nickel plating bath for manufacture of diamond tools, mechanical behaviors of metal-bonded diamond abrasive tools with different grit sizes, and precision form grinding of ceramic materials with diamond grinding wheels",

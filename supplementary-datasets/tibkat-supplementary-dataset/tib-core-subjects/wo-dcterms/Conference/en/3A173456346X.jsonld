            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This up-to-date collection, \"Eco-Materials Processing and Design VIII\", covers \u2013 on a global scale \u2013 the outstanding advances made in researching, producing and using eco-materials. It furnishes materials scientists and end-users with a valuable source of information and new concepts covering the complete spectrum of ecology, eco-materials, nano-materials, bio-materials, recycling, environmental protection and energy conversion related materials. The volume is divided into five sections: the first deals with photocatalysts for controlling air pollution and water pollution, as well as the topics of deodorization, self-cleaning, power light sources, and standardization of the methodology of photocatalytic reactivity. The second section covers the incorporation of an end-of-life strategy into materials design. The third section treats the use of non-hazardous components as substitutes for traditionally hazardous components, as well the treatment of waste materials. The fourth presents a philosophy of manufacturing using more environmentally-friendly processing (eco-processing) and eco-materials design, as well as biomaterials. The final section covers energy-related and energy conversion related materials.This certainly makes the book essential reading for all of those who care about preserving the world for future generations. Eco-materials go beyond merely being recycled or recyclable. They are created and constructed to support sustainability at all stages of their use, and they are designed to consider local or global ecological situations, materials recycling, environmental protection and energy conservation. These proceedings from the January 2007 symposium include dozens of papers for each general topic such as the use of photocatalysts to control air and water pollution along with deodorization, self-cleaning, power light sources and standards for reactivity; incorporation of end-of-life strategy into materials design; waste materials and the substitution of non-hazardous components for those that are hazardous; the philosophy of manufacturing with environmentally-friendly processes and design, including biomaterials; and energy-related materials and those that promote energy conservation",

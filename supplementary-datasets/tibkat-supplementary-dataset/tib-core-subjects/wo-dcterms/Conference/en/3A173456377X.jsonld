            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The 20th century was a period during which many new sciences and engineering techniques appeared and evolved, and were applied to industrial applications. Towards the end of that century, however, it was recognized that - in many cases - the industrial technologies that underpin current-day society suffered from wider sociogical deficiencies. The usual engineering approaches began to face many difficulties which arose from the high habitual levels of consumption of energy and resources.. Energy sources, and supplies of various resources, have already begun to diminish in the 21st century. These limitations on energy and resources require science and technology to adapt quickly to this new regimen. As well as creating and developing efficient new technologies, those sciences and engineering methods developed in the last century have to be raised to much higher levels, of efficiency of energy- and materials-use, in the present century. Since materials science and engineering are the common factor in many industries, the \"designing of interfaces for materials and their joints\" which is an essential aspect of materials science and technology become key points for consideration in this collection",

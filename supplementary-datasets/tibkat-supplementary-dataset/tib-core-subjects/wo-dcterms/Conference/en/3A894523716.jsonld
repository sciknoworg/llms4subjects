            "abstract": "International competition has awakened the American business place to improve quality, shorten cycle time, & streamline the overall engineering, manufacturing, & acquisition processes. Government has stepped back & is allowing contractors to use their own proven processes rather than conform to rigid \"how to\" specifications. Industry is emphasizing teams that coordinate & integrate all disciplines to shorten drastically the time from concept to market. The theme of this Symposium, Managing Uncertainty, addresses the place of all of the assurance disciplines in this new business environment as well as the new tools that must be used to assure the highest product integrity at the most competitive cost. Partial Contents: Accelerated Testing; Aging: Its Prevention & Effects; Environmental Testing; Fault Tolerance (Robustness); Global Logistics; International Collaboration; Modeling & Simulation; Product & Process Integration; Product Design & Assurance; Production-Process R & M for Product Integrity; R & M Cost vs Benefit Tradeoffs",

            "abstract": "The main purpose of this special collection was to gather together up-to-date knowledge from scientists, researchers and technologists in order to review the status of processing technologies, materials development, emerging applications and economics/affordability issues.The resultant scope is necessarily broad: contributors who are involved in titanium production technology, vapor, solid and liquid titanium processing/post-processing, alloy development, microstructure/property enhancement, modeling and simulation, and applications and market development were invited to participate. The diverse mix of papers presented here reflects the breadth of activity aimed at the cost-affordable use of titanium in emerging applications. The editors\u2019 opening overview paper attempts to present the broad sweep of present and projected titanium cost-reduction schemes; in both titanium production and in subsequent processing. What is made particularly clear is that the impetus, in broadening markets, for titanium is very dependent upon cost reduction; particularly in cost-sensitive industries such as automobile production. The papers are grouped into several main chapters: Overview and Low Cost Processing, Low Cost Materials and Processing, Powder Consolidation and Properties I, Powder Consolidation and Properties II, Creative Processing and Property Enhancement I and Creative Processing and Property Enhancement II.Overall, this constitutes an exhaustive and unique survey of the topic. This collection of 24 selected, peer-reviewed papers were originally presented during the TMS 2010 spring symposium on Cost-Affordable Titanium III. The papers are divided into six chapters that represent how the symposium was organized: overview and low-cost processing, low-cost materials and processing, powder consolidation and properties I and II, and creating processing I and II. Editors are Imam (Naval Research Laboratory), Froes (U. of Idaho), and Dring (Norsk Titanium)",

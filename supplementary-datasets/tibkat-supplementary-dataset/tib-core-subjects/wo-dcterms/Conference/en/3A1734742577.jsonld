                "This book reports on cutting-edge design methods and tools in industrial engineering, advanced findings in mechanics and material science, and relevant technological applications. Topics span from geometric modelling tools to applications of virtual/augmented reality, from interactive design to ergonomics, human factors research and reverse engineering. Further topics include integrated design and optimization methods, as well as experimental validation techniques for product, processes and systems development, such as additive manufacturing technologies. This book is based on the International Conference on Design Tools and Methods in Industrial Engineering, ADM 2019, held on September 9\u201310, 2019, in Modena, Italy, and organized by the Italian Association of Design Methods and Tools for Industrial Engineering, and the Department of Engineering \u201cEnzo Ferrari\u201d of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy. It provides academics and professionals with a timely overview and extensive information on trends and technologies in industrial design and manufacturing",

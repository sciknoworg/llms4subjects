            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).During the past decade, digital manufacturing science and technology have experienced very rapid development. These have not only provided industry with new methods, new tools and new digitalized products - which have transformed everything from design, materials processing to operational and management procedures - but are also changing the intercommunications, modes of thought and working environments of everybody in the manufacturing field. Digital manufacturing has brought remarkable and fundamental improvements to manufacturing industry and related research. This collection includes 181 peer-reviewed papers covering topics as varied as: e-commerce engineering, collaborative product design & manufacturing, modeling and simulation of the workflow of the design and manufacturing process, modeling and simulation of materials processing, modeling and integration of enterprises, enterprise resource-planning, workshop planning and management, knowledge engineering applications in digital enterprises, development of digitalized products, virtual manufacturing and numerical control of equipment.This book will be invaluable to production and development engineers, research students and academics working in these fields. This volume contains approximately 180 papers originally presented at the Sixth International Conference on e-Engineering & Digital Enterprise Technology, held in Harbin, China, in August 2007. The papers reflect the dynamic growth of digital manufacturing science and technology that has occurred in the past decade. Primary topics include: e-commerce engineering, collaborative product design and manufacturing, modeling and simulation of material processing, modeling and integration of enterprise, enterprise resources planning, knowledge engineering applications in digital enterprise, development of digitalized products, virtual manufacturing, and numerical control of equipment. Collection editors are: Cheng, Yingxue Yao, Zhou, Qi Yao, Xie, Yu, Gong, and Hou. All are affiliated with the Harbin Institute of Technology",

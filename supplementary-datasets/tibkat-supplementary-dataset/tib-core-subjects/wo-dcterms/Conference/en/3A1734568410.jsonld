            "abstract": "This volume comprises a collection of papers which were subjected to strict peer-review by 2 to 4 expert referees. It aims to present the latest advances in, and applications of, structural engineering, bridge engineering, tunnel, subway and underground facilities, seismic engineering, environment-friendly construction and development, monitoring and control of structures, structural rehabilitation, retrofitting and strengthening, reliability and durability of structures, computational mechanics, construction technology, etc. This will be essential reading matter for those involved in public works, at every level.  Chen (Hainan U., China) et al. present a seven-volume set containing about 1,300 papers from the 2011 International Conference on Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Materials, held in June 2011 in Haikou, China. The conference shared knowledge and facilitated networking interactions on emerging trends and new challenges in civil engineering, architecture, and building materials. Contributed by engineers from China, papers focus on topics in structural, bridge, geotechnical, geological, seismic, road and railway, transportation, hydraulic, coastal, water supply and drainage, and surveying engineering; tunnel, subway, and underground facilities; heating, gas supply, ventilation, and air conditioning works; disaster prevention and mitigation; environment-friendly construction and development; monitoring, control, reliability, and durability of structures; structural rehabilitation, retrofitting, and strengthening; cartography and geographic information systems; computational mechanics; construction technology; computer simulation and CAD/CAE; engineering management; architectural design and theory; building technology science; urban and landscape planning and design; and other topics",

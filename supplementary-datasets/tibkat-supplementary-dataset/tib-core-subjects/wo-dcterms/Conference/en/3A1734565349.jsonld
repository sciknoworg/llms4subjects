            "abstract": "With the rapid development of science and technology, the functionalization of structural materials, and the structurization of functional materials are attracting increasing attention in the scientific and engineering fields. The development of multi-functional materials and structures (MFMS), at the micro- and nano-scale levels, has grown rapidly due to the requirement of increasing safety margins for all infrastructure, biomedical and engineering elements. Multi-functional material systems are capable of performing multiple \"primary\" functions, simultaneously or sequentially in time, and are specially designed to improve system performance via a reduction in the redundancy between sub-system materials and functions. Materials having special structures can exhibit multi-functional properties. For example, shape-memory alloys can act as actuators as well as sensors, and the aim of composite materials is to exploit each aspect's advantages; plus their synergistic effect.The current collection of peer-reviewed papers focuses on multi-functional materials and structures for various engineering applications, and makes a valuable contribution to the literature on the subject. Structural materials that have other functions, and functional materials that are also structural\u2014constitute a burgeoning field; such multi-functional materials and structures (MFMS) have attracted attention for their potential\u2014for adding to safety margins in particular\u2014in many types of infrastructure, biomedical, and engineering applications. Two volumes hold 550 papers (selected from more than 1,500 submissions) presented at the October 2009 conference on the topic held in China, organized by Ocean U. of China and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The proceedings of this second conference are arranged in sections on smart materials and structures, nano-materials and nano-technology, coating and thin film technologies, materials corrosion and protection, computer modeling and analysis, and new technologies for materials preparation. A more specific sampling of topics: crack crazing patterns interaction based on damage criteria, magnetic shape memory alloy and application in structural vibration control, properties of multiple-functional cationic silk fabrics, and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes reinforced natural rubber composites.

            "abstract": "The aim of this book is to make an important contribution to the development of new functional and structural ceramic materials, which exhibit enhanced performances and improved lifetimes and reliability, by fostering a better understanding of the mechanisms of their deterioration and failure under various stress conditions at various operating temperatures. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The work covers the topics of: basic failure phenomena; indentation fracture; fracture and fractography of structural, electro- and bio-/dental ceramics; fracture of fiber-reinforced composites; fracture of porous and laminated ceramics; defect-strength and microstructure - fracture toughness relationships; damage mechanisms in nanoceramics; fracture and fractography of multilayered ceramics and coatings; machining cracks and edge-chipping; and fracture and fractography of composites and nanocomposites. Overall, the contributions to this collection accurately reflect the current state of knowledge with respect to the fractography of advanced ceramics. The aim of the September 2008 International Conference on Fractography, held in Slovakia, was to exchange knowledge on damage mechanisms and fracture processes in structural, functional, and bio-ceramics at various operating temperatures, and to explore relationships between microstructural and mechanical properties of monolithic, composite, and nano-ceramic materials. Selected peer-reviewed papers from the conference cover topics such as basic failure phenomena, indentation fracture, and fracture and fractography of structural, electro- and bio- dental ceramics. Other subjects include fiber-reinforced composites, fracture of porous and laminated ceramics, defect-strength and microstructure, fracture and fractography of multilayered ceramics and coatings, machining cracks and edge-chipping, and fracture and fractography of composites and nanocomposites. B&w images are included",

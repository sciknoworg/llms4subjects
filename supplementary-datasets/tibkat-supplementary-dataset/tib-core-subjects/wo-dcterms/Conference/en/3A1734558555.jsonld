            "abstract": "The present volume contains selected papers from the 12th Grinding and Machining Conference, held in China (GMC 2003).Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS). This collection presents a selection of over 250 papers, submitted to the conference by many universities and industrial concerns. All of the papers were subjected to peer-review by at least two expert referees. Moreover, fifteen papers on high-speed machining were specially selected by Dr. Ning He, a full professor at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), from papers submitted to the International Conference on High Speed Machining, which is organized by the NUAA and will be held in Nanjing from March 31st to April 2nd, 2004. These papers have been selected for the present volume because of their quality and the fact that they cover the main topics of the conference. Overall, the volume presents the reader with recent advances in the field of abrasive technology. It is divided into five sections: (i) Tooling technology; (ii) Processes and mechanisms; (iii) Novel techniques; (iv) Automation and (v) High-speed machining. The topics covered include the mechanics and control of grinding and abrasive processes, the modeling and simulation of grinding and cutting processes, high-speed machining, micro-machining, measurement and surface quality assessment, cooling and coolants, polishing, wheel truing and dressing, novel abrasive techniques and novel machining techniques. The book will therefore be of great interest to production and research engineers, research students and academics working in this field",

            "abstract": "The International Symposium on Ultra-Clean Processing of Semiconductor Surfaces (UCPSS) is a bi-annual conference which has been organized by IMEC since 1992. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The scope of the symposium includes all issues related to contamination, cleaning and surface preparation in mainstream large-scale Integrated Circuit manufacture. At first, silicon was typically the main semiconductor of interest. As other semiconducting materials such as SiGe, SiC, Ge and III-V compounds came under consideration for future devices, the scope was broadened so as to include these materials. Parallelling the fast-moving CMOS industry, the photovoltaic industry has also recognized the need to make improvements in cleaning. Moreover, in order to promote these semiconductor cleaning activities in PV, it was decided to add a special session focused on this topic.  This collection of papers from a September 2010 symposium encompasses all issues related to contamination, cleaning, and surface preparation of mainstream, large-scale integrated circuit manufacturing, including aspects of ultra-clean technology for large scale integration on semiconductors; cleaning and contamination control on both front end of the line and back end of the line processes; and cleaning for semiconductor photo-voltaic applications. This year's symposium contained more contributions dealing with non-silicon high-mobility semiconductor materials and contributions on particle removal using various kinds of mechanical force enhancement. There is also an increased focus on damage and defects introduced by cleaning. Papers are presented in sections on surface chemistry and etching, photo resist removal, mechanical cleaning forces, liquid aerosol cleaning, megasonic cleaning, cleaning for 3D applications, controlling for metallic and organic contamination, and cleaning for silicon photo-voltaic applications",

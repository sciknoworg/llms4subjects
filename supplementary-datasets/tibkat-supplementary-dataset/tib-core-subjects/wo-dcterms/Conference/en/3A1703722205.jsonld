                "This book presents a collection of original research papers from the 2nd International Conference on Mathematical and Related Sciences, held in Antalya, Turkey, on 27 - 30 April 2019 and sponsored/supported by D\u00fczce University, Turkey; the University of Jordan; and the Institute of Applied Mathematics, Baku State University, Azerbaijan. The book focuses on various types of mathematical methods and models in applied sciences; new mathematical tools, techniques and algorithms related to various branches of applied sciences; and important aspects of applied mathematical analysis. It covers mathematical models and modelling methods related to areas such as networks, intelligent systems, population dynamics, medical science and engineering, as well as a wide variety of analytical and numerical methods. The conference aimed to foster cooperation among students, researchers and experts from diverse areas of mathematics and related sciences and to promote fruitful exchanges on crucial research in the field. This book is a valuable resource for graduate students, researchers and educators interested in applied mathematics and interactions of mathematics with other branches of science to provide insights into analysing, modelling and solving various scientific problems in applied sciences",

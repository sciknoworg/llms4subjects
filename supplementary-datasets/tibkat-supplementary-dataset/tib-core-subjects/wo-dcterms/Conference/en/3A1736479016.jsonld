                "This book addresses a range of complex issues associated with condition monitoring (CM), fault diagnosis and detection (FDD) in smart buildings, wide area monitoring (WAM), wind energy conversion systems (WECSs), photovoltaic (PV) systems, structures, electrical systems, mechanical systems, smart grids, etc. The book\u2019s goal is to develop and combine all advanced nonintrusive CMFD approaches on a common platform. To do so, it explores the main components of various systems used for CMFD purposes. The content is divided into three main parts, the first of which provides a brief introduction, before focusing on the state of the art and major research gaps in the area of CMFD. The second part covers the step-by-step implementation of novel soft computing applications in CMFD for electrical and mechanical systems. In the third and final part, the simulation codes for each chapter are included in an extensive appendix to support newcomers to the field. .",

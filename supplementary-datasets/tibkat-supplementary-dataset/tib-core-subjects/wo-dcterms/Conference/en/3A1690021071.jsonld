                "This book presents the selected peer-reviewed papers from the National Conference on Advances in Mechanical Engineering (NCAME 2019), held at the National Institute of Technology Delhi, India. The book covers different areas of mechanical engineering from design engineering to manufacturing engineering. A wide range of topics are discussed such as CAD/CAM, additive manufacturing, fluid dynamics, materials science and engineering, simulation and modeling, finite element analysis, applied mechanics to name a few. The contents provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in mechanical engineering research in the country. Given the scope of the topics covered, the book will be of interest for students, researchers and professionals working in mechanical engineering.",

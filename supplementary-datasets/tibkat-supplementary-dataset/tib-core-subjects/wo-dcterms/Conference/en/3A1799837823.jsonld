                "This book gathers cutting-edge research and best practices relating to occupational risk and safety management, healthcare and ergonomics. It covers strategies for different types of industry, such as construction, food, chemical and healthcare. It gives a special emphasis on challenges posed by automation, discussing solutions offered by technologies, and reporting on case studies carried out in different countries. Chapters are based on selected contributions to the 17th International Symposium on Occupational Safety and Hygiene (SHO 2021), held virtually on November 17-19, 2021, from Portugal. By reporting on different perspectives, such as the ones from managers, workers and OSH professionals, and covering timely issues, such as safety evaluation of human-robot collaboration, this book offers extensive information and a source of inspiration to OSH researchers, practitioners and organizations operating in both local and global contexts",

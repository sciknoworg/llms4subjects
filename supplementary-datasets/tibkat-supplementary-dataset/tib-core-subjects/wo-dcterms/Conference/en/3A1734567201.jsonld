            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Cast iron, one of the oldest alloys known to the human race is still finding new applications in spite of fierce competition from lighter alloys as well as from the most recently discovered new materials. From its earliest beginnings in around 500BC, cast iron underwent little change until the revolutionary development of spheroidal-graphite (ductile) iron in 1949. This discovery was the spark that ignited a series of unexpected transmogrifications of that ancient alloy.After three centuries cast iron is still, surprisingly, widening its scope of application; thanks to the dedicated research work that has been carried out over the past few decades. This volume contains 82 scientific papers, originating from 24 countries, which reflect the progress made in the understanding and development of cast irons. The main topics emphasize the fundamental research carried out on the solidification and solid-state transformations of cast iron, white and alloyed irons, computational modeling of cast-iron transformation and processing, properties, quality, process control and applications.This work is a veritable handbook guide to the subject. In the context of the manifold increase in the strength of cast iron over the past decades, but also the growing competition from advanced materials, the 82 oral and poster papers cover graphite nucleation and morphology, solidification and structure formation of cast iron, solid-state transformation in cast iron, white and alloyed cast irons, the computational modeling of cast iron transform, quality and properties, and processing and applications. The keynote addresses review recent cast iron research carried out at the Foundry Department of the Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute, which serves Egypt's metallurgical industries; and the mechanism of formation of casting skin in compacted graphite iron and its effect on tensile properties. Other topics include theories of graphite formation in iron, effects of chromium and vanadium contents on continuous cooling transformation behavior in multi-component white cast iron, and the bending strength of cast materials reinforced with hard particles",

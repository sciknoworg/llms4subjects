            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Concrete is, both practically and metaphorically, one of the major civil-engineering materials supporting modern society. But both concrete technology, and its structures, face daunting challenges arising from environmental erosion and other natural, and man-made, hazards. The objective of this collection, devoted to Advances in Concrete and Structures (ICACS), is to bring together authoritative reports, by researchers, engineers, and public administrators - located all over the world - on the current state of knowledge concerning the latest advances in concrete structure use in the field of civil engineering.This will be essential reading for all those charged with the design or protection of concrete products. This 139 papers in this collection originally were presented during the Conference on Advances in Concrete & Structures held in Changsha, China, in June 2008. Concrete is one of the major civil engineering materials in modern society. But concrete technology and structures are challenged by environmental erosion and other natural and manmade hazards. The papers address these issues and a variety of others, such as: concrete materials and durability, deterioration assessment and structure behavior, advanced concrete technology and high performance concrete, and new structural systems and innovative design methods. Editors are Huo (Center for Protection Research of Engineering Structures, Hunan U.), Xiao (U. of Southern California, Hunan U.), Li (civil engineering, Hong Kong U. of Science and Technology), and Ahmad (American Concrete Institute)",

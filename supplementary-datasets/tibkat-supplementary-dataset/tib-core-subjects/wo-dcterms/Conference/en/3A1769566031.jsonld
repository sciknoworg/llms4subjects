                "This book presents recent methodological, technological, and experimental developments concerning human-friendly robots and their introduction into everyday life. The book contains a selection of 10 papers presented at the 13th edition of the International Workshop on Human-Friendly Robotics (HFR). The International Workshop on Human-Friendly Robotics (HFR) is an annual meeting that brings together academic scientists, researchers, and research scholars to present their latest, original findings on all aspects concerning human-friendly robotics where safe and dependable machines operate in close proximity to humans or directly interact with them in a wide range of contexts. The 13th edition was organized by the University of Innsbruck and took place in Innsbruck, Austria. The book is primarily intended for robotics researchers and postgraduates which are doing or willing to do research in fields related to human-friendly robotics, including human\u2013robot interaction, robot control, robot learning, and intuitive interfaces. . .",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The primary aim of this volume was to gather together the current knowledge and expertise of scientists and engineers working, in both academia and industry, on damage assessment, structural health monitoring (SHM) and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). The themes of the book reflect current interests existing in the wider field of damage assessment. It is interesting to observe the rise in popularity of system diagnostics and prognosis, as reflected by the increasing number of papers published in this area. A significant proportion of the book is dedicated to damage assessment and condition monitoring. The book covers activities relevant to the damage assessment of engineering structures and systems, including: signal processing of sensor measurements and analytical techniques as well as experimental case studies. The topics are grouped under the headings of: Damage location and quantification; Developments in signal processing and algorithms; Damage assessment; Condition monitoring; System diagnostics and prognosis; Damage mechanisms; Fatigue damage; Structural integrity and damage assessment; Advanced methods of NDT.The work is thus a veritable handbook guide to the subject. The biennial conference draws scientists and engineers in academia and industry to share views and recent scientific and technical findings on damage assessment, structural health monitoring, and non-destructive evaluation. Over 100 papers from this incarnation cover damage location and quantification, developments in signal processing and algorithms, damage assessment, condition monitoring, system diagnostics and prognosis, damage mechanisms, fatigue damage, structural integrity, and advanced methods of non-destructive testing. The keynote papers discuss fault damage power and a self-recovery system of machinery, and acoustic emission in structural health monitoring. Other topics include transmission and reflection coefficients for identifying damage in one-dimensional elements, the response characteristics of various impact patterns on the smart bumper of automotives, and applying cyclic correlation analysis to gear damage detection",

            "abstract": "\"The Pedagogies of Re-Use captures the amazing digital gathering of students, academics, practitioners, and activists that happened at the International School of Re-Construction. Involving over 100 people, from countries as far apart as Brazil, Canada, Ireland, UK, Spain, Germany, Greece, UAE and China, the participants spent two weeks working in 11 teams to consider architectural propositions responding to the current climate and ecological emergency. This book documents the work of the 11 teams, considering the themes they pursued, the student projects proposed, and the final design ideas developed by each group. Supplemented with images of the work, the book also includes leading academics and professionals who supported the school and contribute their voices to these crucial issues of de-construction, re-use and adaptation. It is ideal reading for students and academics looking at the issues created by the climate emergency to which architecture must respond\"--",

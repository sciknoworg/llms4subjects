                "This book offers a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the field of applied mathematics as it relates to finance, marketing, and economics. It covers a range of topics including the effective utilization of applied mathematics and mathematical modeling in finance, economics, and marketing. Additionally, it explores the intersection between applied mathematics and practical applications in various scientific fields. The book targets a multidisciplinary audience, fostering the exchange of diverse ideas and showcasing the broad appeal of different subjects. It delves into recent developments in areas such as mathematical modeling in finance, mathematical modeling in marketing, the modeling of financial and economic fundamentals (e.g., interest rates, asset prices), market behavior modeling, modeling market imperfections, pricing financial derivative securities, hedging strategies, numerical methods, and financial engineering. The book features selected contributions presented at the first edition of the International Conference in Applied Mathematics to Finance, Marketing and Economics, which took place at the National School of Commerce and Management in El Jadida, Morocco, from November 26 to 27, 2020."

                "This book consists of select proceedings of the International Conference on Functional Material, Manufacturing and Performances (ICFMMP) 2019, and presents latest research on using the combined intelligence of people, processes, and machines to impact the overall economics of manufacturing. The book focuses on optimizing manufacturing resources, improving business value and safety, and reducing waste \u2013 both on the floor and in back-office operations. It highlights the applications of the latest manufacturing execution system (MES), intelligent devices, machine-to-machine communication, and data analysis for the production lines and facilities. This book will be useful to manufacturers of finished goods and of sub-assemblies in the automotive, agriculture, and construction equipment sector. It will also provide solutions to make production strategies exceptional and can be a useful reference for beginners, researchers, and professionals interested in intelligent manufacturing technologies.",

            "abstract": "Nanotechnology refers to the creation of useful materials, devices and systems via the manipulation of matter on a miniscule scale; a nanometer being a billionth of a meter. Nanotechnology is being applied to almost every field imaginable, including electronics, magnetics, optics, information technology, materials development and biomedicine. The 190 selected peer-reviewed papers presented here are grouped into: Chapter 1: Nanotechnology and Industrial Application, Chapter 2: Computer Science and Engineering, Chapter 3: Communications and Management, Chapter 4: Control and Automation. This is an excellent introduction to the field for those interested in the exploitation of nanotechnology.  This thick proceedings volume presents peer-reviewed papers from the first IITA International Conference on Nanotechnology and Computer Engineering (CNCE) held July 2010 in Qingdao, China; the conference was co-sponsored by the Intelligent Information Technology Application Research Association, Hong Kong, and the National University of Singapore. Approximately 200 contributions are arranged in sections labeled as follows: nanotechnology and industry applications, computer science and engineering, communication and management, and control and automation. Despite the conference title, nanotechnology does not seem to enter very directly into most (or many) of the contributed papers. Perhaps the future will bring more cross-pollination of the disciplines. To a limited degree a keyword index will help readers navigate the wide range of topics, given that the broad themes don't seem to usefully organize them. For example, under communication and management are papers on protection algorithms in multi-domain optical networks, digitization of Chinese ancient books, design of a phase shift signal generator, and an economic analysis of the photovoltaic industry",

                "With the rapid increase of population, industrialization, urbanization, and the abuse of science and technology, environmental problems have showed an explosive development trend. Actions must be taken to ensure the rational exploitation and utilization of natural resources, prevent environmental pollution and ecological damage, and coordinate the relationship between environment and social development. Proceedings of 4th International Conference on Resources and Environmental Research (ICRER 2022) focuses on effective use of environmental resources, ecological restoration and remediation of degraded and polluted environment, and emission reduction technologies. This book brings the latest advances in resources and environmental research."

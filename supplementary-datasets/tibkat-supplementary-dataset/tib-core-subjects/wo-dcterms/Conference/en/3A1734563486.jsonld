            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Deformation and annealing phenomena are of great technical significance to the processing and application of materials at the industrial scale. This edited collection of peer-reviewed papers was designed as a one-off vehicle for reviewing the current understanding of the basic mechanisms and processes that control deformation and annealing in various materials, together with their modelling and simulation. Another aim was to facilitate discussion of the failings of established theories, to explore new ideas, and to identify avenues where future research is required. The present papers apply these concepts to a wide range of materials and applications; from conventional steels and light alloys to nanocrystalline gold wires and geological samples. The concept for the collection was inspired by the research interests of Professor John Humphreys, who has made outstanding contributions to this field over many years. Its creation also coincided with his official \"retirement\" from the School of Materials of Manchester University. The collection thus provides an opportune moment to review the state of the art and to encourage a new generation of scientists to take up the challenge of tackling the outstanding critical issues remaining in deformation and annealing. A total of 94 papers from the September 2006 symposium review the basic mechanisms and processes that control deformation and annealing in different materials, and share recent progress in modeling and simulation. Keynote papers propose models for the prediction of plastic anisotropy and deformation textures, nucleation of recrystallization in aluminum alloys, and microstructure evolution during thermo-mechanical processing. Other topics include deformation processing of sheet metals by continuous frictional angular extrusion, deformation and heat treatment of cold drawn gold, Goss orientation during deformation and annealing of an FeSi crystal, and grain growth kinetics in sub-microcrystalline Armco-iron",

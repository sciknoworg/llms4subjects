                "The goals ofthe Symposium were to highlight advances in modelling ofatmosphere and ocean dynamics, to provide a forum where atmosphere and ocean scientists could present their latest research results and learn ofprogress and promising ideas in these allied disciplines; to facilitate interaction between theory and applications in atmosphere/ocean dynamics. These goals were seen to be especially important in view ofcurrent efforts to model climate requiring models which include interaction between atmosphere, ocean and land influences. Participants were delighted with the diversity ofthe scientific programme; the opportunity to meet fellow scientists from the other discipline (either atmosphere or ocean) with whom they do not normally interact through their own discipline; the opportunity to meet scientists from many countries other than their own; the opportunity to hear significant presentations (50 minutes) from the keynote speakers on a range ofrelevant topics. Certainly the goal ofcreating a forum for exchange between atmosphere and ocean scientists who need to input to create realistic models for climate prediction was achieved by the Symposium and this goal will hopefully be further advanced by the publication ofthese Proceedings."

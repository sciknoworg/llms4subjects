            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The objective of this special collection was to provide a forum for researchers, educators, engineers and government officials, involved in the general areas of Advanced Materials, High-Performance Structures and Materials Engineering, to disseminate their latest research results and exchange views on the future research directions of these fields. The contents of the two-volume set of 351 peer-reviewed papers are grouped into three chapters: High-Performance Structures and Materials Engineering, Computer Science and Material Science and Materials Engineering and Industrial Applications. It will thus constitute a handy guide to these subjects.  The first in a projected series of conferences draw some 360 papers by scientists and engineers in a wide array of fields who discuss their experience with high-performance materials and structures in their work. They also cover computer science and material science, and materials engineering and commercial application. Among specific topics are the molecular dynamics simulation of diffusion behavior for thermal-plastic fusion bonding, a computational algorithm for a spatial serial robot, the maximum detection thickness for flatness detecting systems of hot-rolled strips, the effect of melt overheating history on the microstructure of nitrogen-based single-crystal superalloy, fuzzy iterative learning control of a servo system, multimedia ordering systems in catering services, logistic system information perception model building in the environment of The Internet of Things, and crush behavior in corrugated-cores sandwich panels. The two volumes are paged consecutively and indexed together",

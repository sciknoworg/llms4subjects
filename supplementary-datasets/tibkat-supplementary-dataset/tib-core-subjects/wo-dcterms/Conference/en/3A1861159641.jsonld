            "abstract": "This book contains research papers presented at the 7th International Conference on Civil Engineering, which was held in Singapore from 24-26 March 2023. Significant results contained in the book show the importance of technology in solving engineering issues throughout the world. Highlighted topics include climate change, disaster relief, resilience, pollution control and management techniques for construction, mitigation and adaptation. Many techniques are utilized in a variety of contexts to solve engineering and urban management problems in both developed and developing countries. This volume consists of refereed submissions authored by a wide variety of international researchers and practitioners from many perspectives discussing emerging issues in civil and environmental engineering. Practical solutions to worldwide issues in hazard mitigation, pollution control, transportation infrastructure and energy production are emphasized. The chapters provide an in-depth look at current issues in these areas of engineering that should benefit interested individuals at all levels of expertise.",

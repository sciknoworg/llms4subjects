            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Wide-bandgap semiconductors, such as silicon carbide and group-III nitrides, are attracting increased attention as promising materials for high-power, high-frequency and high-temperature electronics use, as well as for short-wavelength light-emitters. The volume is arranged into seven chapters which cover the topics of SiC and related materials, bulk and epi-growth, characterization of SiC and related materials, devices and applications. Novel subject areas that enjoy a strong increase in contributions include cutting-edge SiC nanostructures, and graphene. From the scientific point of view, it is seen that bipolar degradation can be significantly reduced by appropriate materials preparation. Cubic Silicon Carbide is once again attracting attention from both researchers and industry. It has also been shown that the reliability of MOS structures on SiC is improving. Moreover, there has been a step-change increase in the application of SiC technologies to renewable energy systems and space domains. A close examination of this volume will equip the reader with a clear state-of-the-art overview of the field.This comprehensive work offers a superlative overview for those already working in these fields, as well as offering a sound introduction to newcomers. Wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising materials for high-power, high-frequency, and high-temperature electronics use, as well as for short-wavelength light-emitters. Papers from a September 2008 offer an overview of the field. Papers are arranged into seven chapters on SiC and related materials, bulk and epi-growth, characterization of SiC and related materials, devices, and applications. This year, there were increased contributions in areas including cutting-edge SiC nanostructures, graphene, and cubic silicon carbide. Applications of SiC technologies to renewable energy systems and space domains are highlighted. Other areas examined are the growth of 4H-SiC single crystals on 6H-SiC seeds with an open backside by PVT method, characterization of 6H-SiC single crystals using different source materials, observation of polytype switches during SiC PVT bulk growth by high energy X-ray diffraction, and nucleation and growth of 3C-SiC single crystals from the vapor phase. B&w images are included",

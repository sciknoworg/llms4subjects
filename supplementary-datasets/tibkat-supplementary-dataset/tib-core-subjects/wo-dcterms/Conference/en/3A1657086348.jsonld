                "This volume presents a series of overview articles arising from a workshop exploring the links among shallow clouds, water vapor, circulation, and climate sensitivity. It provides a state-of-the art synthesis of understanding about the coupling of clouds and water vapor to the large-scale circulation. The emphasis is on two phenomena, namely the self-aggregation of deep convection and interactions between low clouds and the large-scale environment, with direct links to the sensitivity of climate to radiative perturbations. Each subject is approached using simulations, observations, and synthesizing theory; particular attention is paid to opportunities offered by new remote-sensing technologies, some still prospective. The collection provides a thorough grounding in topics representing one of the World Climate Research Program\u2019s Grand Challenges. Previously published in Surveys in Geophysics, Volume 38, Issue 6, 2017 The articles \u201cObserving Convective Aggregation\u201d, \u201cAn Observational View of Relationships Between Moisture Aggregation, Cloud, and Radiative Heating Profiles\u201d, \u201cImplications of Warm Rain in Shallow Cumulus and Congestus Clouds for Large-Scale Circulations\u201d, \u201cA Survey of Precipitation-Induced Atmospheric Cold Pools over Oceans and Their Interactions with the Larger-Scale Environment\u201d, \u201cLow-Cloud Feedbacks from Cloud-Controlling Factors: A Review\u201d, \u201cMechanisms and Model Diversity of Trade-Wind Shallow Cumulus Cloud Feedbacks: A Review\u201d, \u201cStructure and Dynamical Influence of Water Vapor in the Lower Tropical Troposphere\u201d, \u201cEmerging Technologies and Synergies for Airborne and Space-Based Measurements of Water Vapor Profiles\u201d, \u201cObservational Constraints on Cloud Feedbacks: The Role of Active Satellite Sensors\u201d, and \u201cEUREC4A: A Field Campaign to Elucidate the Couplings Between Clouds, Convection and Circulation\u201d are available as open access articles under a CC BY 4.0 license at link.springer.com.",

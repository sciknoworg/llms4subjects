            "abstract": "The present volumes contain selected papers in the fields of Environmental Chemistry and Biology; Environmental Materials; Environmental Safety and Health; Environmental Planning and Assessment; Environmental Analysis and Monitoring; Environmental Engineering; Pollution Control Projects (Air, Water, Solid); Waste Disposal and Recycling; Water Supply and Drainage Engineering; Sound, Noise and Vibration Control; Clean Production Processes; Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering; Architectural Environment & Equipment Engineering; Soil and Water Conservation and Desertification Control; Environmental Protection; Cultivation and Conservation of Forest; Plant Protection and Biotechnology; Geographic Information and Remote Sensing Science; Land Resources Environment and Urban Planning. This up-to-date, comprehensive and worldwide state-of-the art knowledge will be of great value to anyone working in these fields.  This six-volume set draws together 1141 papers from the 2012 International Conference on Energy and Environmental Protection (ICEEP 2012), held in June of that year in Hohhot, China. The conference aimed to address problems and solutions, new issues, and future directions in energy and environmental protection and outline the application of advanced techniques for industrial users. Written by environmental scientists, engineers, and others mainly from China, such as researchers in chemistry, life sciences, forestry, agriculture, and ecology, papers relate to environmental chemistry and biology, materials, safety and health, planning and assessment, analysis and monitoring, and engineering; air, water, and solid pollution control; waste disposal and recycling; water supply and drainage engineering; sound, noise, and vibration control; clean production processes; hydrology and water resources engineering; architectural environment and equipment engineering; soil and water conservation and desertification control; environmental protection; forest cultivation and conservation; plant protection and biotechnology; geographic information and remote sensing science; and land resources environment and urban planning",

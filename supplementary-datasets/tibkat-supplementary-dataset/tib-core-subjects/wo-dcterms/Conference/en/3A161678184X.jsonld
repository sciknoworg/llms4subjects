                "\"Preface This volume embodies the proceedings of the symposium entitled \"Minerals Scales in Biological and Industrial Systems,\" sponsored by the American Chemical Society's Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry. The symposium was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from August 19 to August 23, 2012, as part of the 244th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society. Recognized experts in their respective fields were invited to speak at the symposium, with strong attendance particularly from academia, government, and industrial research centers. This symposium was part of a larger series on this topic. The first symposium addressing issues related to mineral scales and deposits was held in Washington, District of Columbia, from August 21 to August 25, 1999, at the 208th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society. This symposium was organized with the following objectives in mind: (a) to bring together researchers and technologists from academia, research centers, and industries, with active interest in this topic; (b) to provide an opportunity for discussion of recent developments; (c) to offer a forum for exchange of ideas; and (d) to identify the unfulfilled needs and challenges on the control of mineral scales and deposits facing various industries. Water available for domestic and industrial applications contains a variety of soluble and insoluble impurities such as dissolved minerals, natural organic compounds, suspended particles, and domestic and industrial wastes. If the water containing these impurities is used without any pretreatment, it leads, in many cases, to the deposition of unwanted materials on equipment surfaces (e.g., heat exchangers, pumps, pipes, and reverse osmosis membranes)\"--",
                "\"This book brings together nationally and internationally renowned groups of researchers, scientists, and industrial technologists to present information on the interactions of polymeric and non-polymeric inhibitors (natural, synthetic polymers, biopolymers, hybrid polymers) with a variety of scale forming crystals, such as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, calcium oxalate, silica, and metal silicate. The book discusses various physicochemical processes involved in precipitation of scale forming salts, adsorption of inhibitor molecules on different substrates, and dispersion or suspension of suspended particles present in aqueous systems\"--"

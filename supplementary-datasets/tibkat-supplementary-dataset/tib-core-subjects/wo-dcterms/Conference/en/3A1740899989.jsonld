            "abstract": "Many important properties of materials are governed by the microstructures which have evolved during their prior treatment. Therefore, the characterisation of structures and the understanding of structural changes has always been a central problem in any discipline which deals with materials. The invited papers in this volume were written by the lecturers of the 1996 E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Graduate School Summer Course which is organised biennially for graduate and postgraduate physics students who are specializing in the Physics of Materials. This course concentrated on some specific problems and on recent advances in the field of structure characterisation and development in materials; topics which are beyond the scope of the usual Physics of Materials courses. However, due to the rapid progress in investigation methods, and because of the growing relevance of the phenomena considered, many of the topics treated here will certainly become part of standard courses in the future.The lecturers chosen to give this series of intensive courses are always front-line specialists who are requested to begin at the most fundamental level, but to end by relating the newest discoveries in their given field. In this way, the contributions to this volume are addressed equally to those who are beginning to become acquainted with the field and to those who are already active within it",

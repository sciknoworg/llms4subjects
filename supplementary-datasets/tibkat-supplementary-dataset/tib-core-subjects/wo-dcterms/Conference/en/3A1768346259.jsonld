            "abstract": "This book provides readers with a timely snapshot of human factors research and methods fostering a better integration of technologies and humans during the whole manufacturing cycle, giving a special emphasis to the quality and safety of the industrial environment for workers, the efficiency of the manufacturing processes itself, the quality of the final product, and its distribution to and use by the customers. It discusses timely issues relating to the automation of the manufacturing processes, and the challenges imposed by the implementation of industry 4.0, additive manufacturing and 3D printing technologies. Contributions cover a range of industrial sectors, such as the automotive, health and constructions ones, highlighting both organizational and engineering solutions fostering sustainability, globalization, customization, workers\u2019 well-being and consumers\u2019 satisfaction, among other issues. Based on the AHFE 2021 Conferences on Human Aspects of Advanced Manufacturing, Advanced Production Management and Process Control, and Additive Manufacturing, Modeling Systems and 3D Prototyping, held virtually on 25\u201329 July, 2021, from USA, this book, which merges ergonomic research and technical know-how in the field of manufacturing and product design, addresses a wide range of engineers, designers and professionals, dealing with the integration of technologies and humans in the factories of the future.",

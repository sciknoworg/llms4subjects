            "abstract": "Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) are multifunctional materials which exhibit spatial variations in composition and microstructure; created for the specific purpose of achieving variations in thermal, structural or functional properties. They are presently at the forefront of materials research and are receiving worldwide attention. They enjoy a broad range of application; including, for example, biomechanical, automotive, aerospace, mechanical, civil, nuclear and naval engineering. New applications are continually being discovered and developed. This collection of peer-reviewed papers is intended to impart new ideas, state-of-the-art techniques and recent developments in the field of FGMs. The topics covered include: Processing, Manufacturing, Design and Characterization, Modeling and Simulations, Multiscale Multiphysics Modeling, Nano-FGMs, Biomedical and Eco-materials, Biomimetic Materials, Multifunctional Materials, Energy Conversion Materials and Devices, Topology Optimization and Homogenization, Thin Films and Coatings, Surfaces and Interfaces, Computational Techniques, Testing and Characterization, Industrial Applications and Commercialization.It would be difficult to find a more timely and up-to-date coverage of the subject. This volume collects 82 papers from the 10th International Symposium on Multiscale, Multifunctional and Functionally Graded Materials, held in September 2008 in Sendai, Japan. An international group of researchers in engineering, materials science, and other fields discuss topics related to techniques and recent developments in the field of functionally graded materials used in biomechanical, automotive, aerospace, civil engineering, and other applications. Topics include space solar power systems, high temperature coating, electricity, welding, processing, manufacturing, design and characterization, modeling and simulations, multiscale multiphysics modeling, nano-functionally graded materials, biomedical and eco-materials, biomimetic materials, multifunctional materials, energy conversion materials and devices, topology optimization and homogenization, thin films and coatings, surfaces and interfaces, computational techniques, testing and characterization, industrial applications, and commercialization",

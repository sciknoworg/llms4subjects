                "This book covers a variety of topics in the field of industrial engineering, with a special focus on research and industrial applications aimed at both improving quality of processes and products and contributing to a sustainable economy. Based on a set of papers presented at the 1st International Conference \u201cInnovation in Engineering\u201d, ICIE, held in Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal, on June 28\u201330, 2021, it focuses on innovative technologies associated with and strategies for the development of Industry 4.0. The chapters discuss new ways to improve industrial production and supply chain management by applying mathematical and computational methods. They also cover important issues relating to sustainability, education, and collaborations between industry and universities, and national developments. This book, which belongs to a three-volume set, provides engineering researchers and professionals with a timely overview and extensive information on trends and technologies behind the current and future developments of Industry 4.0. .",

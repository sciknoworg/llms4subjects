            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This volume is divided into 3 chapters. The first, focused on Materials and Elaboration Techniques, describes various types of material such as composites, polymers, semiconductors, metals, ceramics, bio-materials, inorganic alloys, textile, porous, crystalline, amorphous and hybrids elaborated by various means such as vapor-phase, liquid-phase, plasma, ion-based and laser-assisted techniques, soft chemistry, self- assembly, bonding, sintering, and including bulk, surface, interface, thin-film and nano-materials. The second chapter, on Characterization Techniques and Properties, covers both physical (optical, structural, electrical, mechanical, magnetic, damage, aging\u2026) and chemical (surface and bulk composition, imaging, impurity, reactivity, catalysis, aging, oxidation, corrosion) aspects. The last chapter, Applications, focuses on subjects such as: (i) environment and energy (renewable energy, storage and energy conversion, transport), (ii) health, biomedical and life science, (iii) electronic devices and systems (micro-nano electronics, power electronics, photonics and optoelectronics, systems, storage and heat management) and (iv) cultural heritage (e.g. archeology).  Representing the proceedings of the Mediterranean Conference on Innovative Material and Applications, held in Beirut, Lebanon in March, 2011, this collection of one hundred and nineteen peer reviewed papers on materials science showcases current scholarship in a wide variety of related fields. The volume is divided into sections covering materials and elaboration techniques, characterizations, techniques and properties, and practical applications, and individual papers address topics in thin film chemistry, nanostructures and matrices and fuel cell technologies. Chapters include abstracts illustrations and individual references and a volume wide-keyword and author index is provided. Contributors include academics in materials and related engineering fields from universities around the world",

                "This book constitutes the proceedings of the 41st SGAI International Conference on Innovative Techniques and Applications of Artificial Intelligence, AI 2021, which was supposed to be held in Cambridge, UK, in December 2021. The conference was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 22 full papers and 10 short papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 37 submissions. The volume includes technical papers presenting new and innovative developments in the field as well as application papers presenting innovative applications of AI techniques in a number of subject domains. The papers are organized in the following topical sections: technical paper; machine learning; AI techniques; short technical stream papers; application papers; applications of machine learning; AI for medicine; advances in applied AI; and short application stream papers",

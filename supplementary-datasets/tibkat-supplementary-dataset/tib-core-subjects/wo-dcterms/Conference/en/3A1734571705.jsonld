            "abstract": "Interest in the phenomenon of superplasticity has been increasing steadily, both from the viewpoint of fundamental scientific understanding as well as of industrial application. The scope of superplasticity has also broadened materials-wise, and now includes, in addition to metals: intermetallics, ceramics, bulk metallic glasses, nanostructured materials and composites. The objective of this special collection was to provide an international forum through which to gather up-to-date knowledge and information on a wide range of topics and to encourage further developments in superplasticity. Over 64 peer-reviewed papers have been selected for publication. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The volume is divided into the following chapters: Mechanisms of Superplasticity, Superplastic Materials, Design, Testing and Modelling, Processing, Industrial Applications. Altogether, the contents constitute a timely and invaluable guide to the state-of-the-art of superplasticity.  These proceedings consist of 62 papers from the 11th International Conference on Superplasticity in Advanced Materials, which took place in July 2012, at the Ecole des Mines in Albi, France. Contributed by an international group of scientists from universities, research centers, and industry, papers address advances in superplastic forming (SPF) and include the plenary lectures on superplasticity in general and its role in earth deformation and the development of high-strain-rate superplastic oxide ceramics based on flow mechanism. They discuss mechanisms of superplasticity, grain boundary sliding, deformation and cavitation, microstructures, and textures; superplastic materials like ceramics, light alloys, titanium alloys, and intermetallics; design, testing, and numerical modeling; the forming process and SPF structure simulation; forming dies and post SPF processes and properties; processing, including grain refinement and processing, high strain rate and low temperature superplasticity, and superplastic forging and rolling; and industrial applications mainly in aeronautics and the automotive industry",

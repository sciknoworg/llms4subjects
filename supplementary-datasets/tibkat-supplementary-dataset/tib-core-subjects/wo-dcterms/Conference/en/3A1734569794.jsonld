            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The mechanical properties of a material are those that involve reaction to an applied load. The mechanical properties of metals determine their range of usefulness and govern their expected service life. Mechanical properties are also used to help to classify and identify materials. The most common properties which are considered are strength, ductility, hardness, impact resistance and fracture toughness. This special collection of peer-reviewed papers discusses the most interesting and up-to-date topics related to the subject and will provide a wealth of ideas for those working in the field.  A September 2011 conference brought together researchers working in many areas of mechanical properties of materials and information technology, in order to foster collaboration between the two fields. Selected peer-reviewed papers from the conference, gathered here, describe recent applications in materials manufacturing and processing, agriculture, and medical applications. The section on mechanical engineering and materials science presents work on areas such as prediction of gas balance schedules in a steel plant, impact assessment of job machine factors on scaling parameters, the application of a frequency converter driver in a long-belt conveyor, and the design of a crop remote-sensing monitoring system based on supermap objects. The section on biomaterials science reports on recent advances in treatment of dye wastewater by zero valent iron composited organobentonite, the use of 6-ginergol against fatigue, isolation and identification of ammonibacteria and ammoniation characteristic analysis, and identification of ZAG protein as a novel serologic biomarker candidate for liver cancer.

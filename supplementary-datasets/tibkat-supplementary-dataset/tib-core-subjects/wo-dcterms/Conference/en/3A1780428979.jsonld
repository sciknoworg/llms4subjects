                "This book covers a wide range of important topics including but not limited to Technology Trends, Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Vision, Communication, Security, e-Learning, and Ambient Intelligence and their applications to the real world. The sixth Future Technologies Conference 2021 was organized virtually and received a total of 531 submissions from academic pioneering researchers, scientists, industrial engineers, and students from all over the world. After a double-blind peer review process, 191 submissions have been selected to be included in these proceedings. One of the meaningful and valuable dimensions of this conference is the way it brings together a large group of technology geniuses in one venue to not only present breakthrough research in future technologies, but also to promote discussions and debate of relevant issues, challenges, opportunities and research findings. We hope that readers find the book interesting, exciting, and inspiring; it provides the state-of-the-art intelligent methods and techniques for solving real-world problems along with a vision of the future research.",

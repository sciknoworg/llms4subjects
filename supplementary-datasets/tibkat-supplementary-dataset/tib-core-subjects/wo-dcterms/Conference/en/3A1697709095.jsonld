                "This book gathers the proceedings of the EPPM 2019 conference, and highlights innovative work by researchers and practitioners active in various industries around the globe. Recent advances in science and technology have made it possible to seamlessly connect and integrate various elements of engineering systems, and opened the door for innovations that have transformed how we live and work. While these developments have yielded enhanced efficiency and numerous improvements in our current practices, the problems caused by the increased complexity of these integrated systems can be extremely difficult. Accordingly, solving these problems involves applying cross-disciplinary expertise to address the heterogeneity of the various elements inherent in the system. These proceedings address four main themes: (I) Smart and Sustainable Construction, (II) Advances in Project Management Practices, (III) Toward Safety and Productivity Improvement, and (IV) Smart Manufacturing, Design, and Logistics. As such, they will be of interest to and valuable to researchers and practitioners in a range of industries seeking an update on the translational fields of engineering, project, and production management."

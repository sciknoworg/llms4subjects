            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The objective of ICAMR 2012 was to provide a forum for the discussion of new developments, recent progress and innovations in the field of Materials Science. The papers are divided into twenty-two sections, covering such topics as materials behaviour, casting and solidification, coatings and surface engineering, composites, machining technology, nanomaterials, biomedical manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing processes, manufacturing planning and scheduling, modelling and simulation, computer-aided design and engineering, semiconductor materials engineering, laser-based manufacturing and mechanical and electronic engineering control.  Representing the proceeding s of the Second International Conference on Advanced Material Research, held in Chengdu, China in January, 2012, this two volume collection of technical articles on materials engineering showcases current scholarship in a wide variety of topics relating to advanced and emerging engineering processes and products. The works are divided into twenty-two sections, covering such topics as materials behavior, casting and solidification, coatings and surface engineering, composites, machining technology, nanomaterials, biomedical manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing processes, manufacturing planning and scheduling, modeling and simulation, computer-aided design and engineering, semiconductor materials engineering, laser based manufacturing, and mechanical and electronic engineering controls. Individual papers include keywords, abstracts, and illustrations. A volume wide author and keyword index is provided. Contributors are academics in engineering and materials science from institutions around the world",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The editors of this special volume made every effort to invite all of those corrosion specialists working in the field of lightweight alloys and, specifically, their modeling. Their expertise provided a basis upon which to discuss corrosion problems and solutions for Military and Aerospace Systems and Facilities; thus laying a solid foundation for the tackling of yet-unsolved issues. The use of lightweight metals and composites to replace heavy structural materials for military hardware and weapons systems (ships, aircraft, ground vehicles, etc.) is a new strategic consideration for defence forces; falling under Naval S&T Strategic Plans. The objectives of the workshop were to seek state-of-the-art ideas, from outside of the continental United States, in the field of low-density metallic materials and composites for structural applications, as well as modeling and simulation software tools which are capable of generating and identifying damage evolution data for health monitoring, corrosion control, life prediction and assessment of civil and military hardware systems. The result is an invaluable guide to this increasingly important topic.  The workshops are overseen by the US Office of Naval Research Global and the Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Milano to gather information from abroad about low-density metals that can be used structurally in military and aerospace contexts, a new strategic requirement for defence forces. They also seek software to help stimulate wear and damage to such metals and the structures they are used in. The 15 papers selected for publication discuss such topics as the electrochemical behavior of nickel-aluminum alloys in sodium chloride solutions, surface protection for aircraft maintenance by means of zinc rich primers, a continuum damage model for a biodegradable magnesium alloy stent, and an approach to iron corrosion via the numerical simulation of a galvanic cell",

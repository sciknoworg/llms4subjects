            "abstract": "The 31st International Conference on Coastal Engineering (ICCE 2008) was held in Hamburg, Germany, 31 August to 5 September 2008 under the auspices of the Coastal Engineering Research Council (CERC). It was a long way from the application to host this conference in Cardiff / Wales in 2002, and many colleagues contributed significantly to the success of the conference. Herewith, we would like to acknowledge all involved colleagues, delegates, CERC and LOC members as well as the supporting institutions and exhibitors for making this conference a successful and memorable event. Namely, we would like to thank the Coastal Engineering Research Council, especially Prof. Robert A. Dalrymple, CERC chairman, and Jane Smith, CERC secretary, for their guidance and encouragement as well as for their help and continuous motivation. It was a pleasant experience to organise this conference together with our US-colleagues. On the other hand, we would like to thank all members of the Local Organising Committee, chaired by Prof. Hans D\u00fccker, representing coastal and harbour authorities, ministries, universities and consultant companies in Germany. Mainly the permanent support of the Local Organising Committee made this conference successful. Many institutions supported this 31st International Conference on Coastal Engineering as a sponsor or as an exhibitor, which was a prerequisite to organise an unforgettable conference. Finally, we would like to acknowledge all the contributions of the delegates, who presented and discussed state of the art papers for a wide range of coastal topics. The present poster proceedings are edited to acknowledge all the excellent posters which were presented and discussed during the conference. It is the intention of the editors to make these posters available for many colleagues world wide. Therefore, the poster proceedings are also uploaded to the conference website",

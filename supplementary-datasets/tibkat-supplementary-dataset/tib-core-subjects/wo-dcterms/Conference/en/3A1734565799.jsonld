            "title": "Ductility of Bulk Nanostructured Materials : Special topic volume, invited papers only",
            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).Strength and ductility are two of the most important mechanical properties of structural materials, but this usually involves a trade-off, because of the fundamental inverse proportionality of these two features. Since the 1980s, bulk nanostructured materials have emerged as a new class of material having unusual structures and, as a result, have attracted increasing attention. Unfortunately, most bulk nanostructured materials still do not evade the strength-ductility trade-off dilemma, and usually have very poor ductility. The poor ductility of bulk nanostructured materials has indeed become a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to the widespread technological application of structural bulk nanostructured materials. This special topic volume brings together fifty-eight invited papers, from twenty countries, covering a wide range of issues related to the ductility of bulk nanostructured materials. They include topics such as: deformation mechanisms, basic conceptions and reviews of ductility, ductility-structure relationships, processing and microstructural evolutions. This work provides authoritative guidance on developing strategies to improve the ductility of nanostructured materials and will permit materials designers to optimize the mechanical properties of nanostructured materials. Bulk nanostructured materials usually have very poor ductility. This work gathers 58 invited papers from 20 countries to report on advances in improving the ductility and optimizing the performance of bulk nanostructured materials. Papers are in sections on deformation mechanisms of bulk nanostructured materials, modeling and experiments in ductility of bulk nanostructured materials, and processing and microstructural advancements. Other major themes are ductility of thin films and nano-layers, ductility of metallic glass and composites, and recovery and grain growth. Some specific topics covered include the effect of grain size on defect density and internal stresses in sub-microcrystals, ultrahigh strength and ductility of Cu-Nb nanolayered composites, nanostructured Ti2448 biomedical titanium alloy, and the effect of aging on strength and ductility of ultrafine grained Al 6061 alloy.

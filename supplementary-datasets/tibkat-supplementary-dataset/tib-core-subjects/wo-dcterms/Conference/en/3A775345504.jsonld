                "The 1996 Conference focused on topics of environmentally attractive technologies for electricity production-renewables, natural gas, and nuclear energy. Recent technology developments were addressed which include creation of more efficient photovoltaic convert\u00ad ers for electricity generation; the current and future role of natural gas in meeting global de\u00ad mand for electric power generation; and the status of nuclear energy, its various applications, and the prospects for its future. The Conference agenda, in light of its global economic im\u00ad pact, included comparative discussions of all the above alternative energy sources. The re\u00ad gional choice of energy sources and their impact on the global economy and environment was reviewed. In addition to the above subjects, but strongly connected with the theme of global en\u00ad ergy needs and security, the Conference program contained one session on new needs and di\u00ad rections in higher education: new curricula to cover fundamental global issues on energy, resources, and environment."

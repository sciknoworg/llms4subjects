            "abstract": "Materials processing engineering is currently considered to be an interdisciplinary engineering field. Learning and training in materials processing must therefore be accompanied by diverse sets of workshops and practical laboratory experiments. In general, the equipment which is required to be available in these laboratories or workshops is very expensive and can become obsolete within a few years. On the other hand, the continual evolution of materials inevitably drives change. However, innovative education techniques, based upon information and communications technologies, are currently under development, with the aim of improving the teaching of materials processing.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS). This special volume on New Frontiers in Materials Processing Learning and Training reports these latest developments and novel applications, and describes theoretical research and case studies related to innovative education as applied to materials processing.This special volume is sure to encourage the further development of new learning and training techniques in this, and other, disciplines. Papers from a September 2008 symposium, 14 in all, highlight recent work related to training and learning in materials processing engineering. They report on the latest developments, original applications, theoretical work, and case studies, with several of the papers addressing the new EHEA guidelines for the teaching of manufacturing engineering in university curricula. Specific topics include computer-aided teaching of the electro discharge machining process, teaching advanced processes in mechanical engineering project learning groups, a methodology for teaching the material removal processes by using CAD/CAM software, and the use of PDAs and smartphones in the classroom. The book includes b&w photos and screenshots. Marcos is affiliated with the University of Cadiz, Spain",

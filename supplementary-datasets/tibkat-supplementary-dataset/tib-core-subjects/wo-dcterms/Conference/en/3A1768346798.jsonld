            "abstract": "This book provides readers with a timely snapshot of research and developments relating to human reliability, performance and safety analysis, and human error, risk and safety management in various industrial contexts, such as manufacturing, transportation and health. It combines a diverse range of disciplines, including work physiology, health informatics, safety engineering, workplace design, injury prevention, and occupational psychology, and presents new strategies for safety management, accident prevention at the workplace, performance testing and participatory ergonomics. It discusses issues related to automation, and strategies for a safer Human-Automation Interaction. Based on the proceedings of the AHFE 2021 International Conferences on Safety Management and Human Factors, and Human Error, Reliability, Resilience, and Performance, which were held virtually on July 25-29, 2021, from USA, the book offers an extensive and inspiring guide for both researchers and practitioners dealing with the topics of safety management, human error prevention, and integration of automation in the workplace. .",

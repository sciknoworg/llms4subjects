            "abstract": "This collection of papers, which was subjected to strict peer-review by 2 to 4 expert referees, aims to collect together the latest advances in, and applications of, traditional constructional materials, advanced constructional materials and green building materials. It cannot fail to suggest new ideas and strategies to be tried in this field.  This four-volume set contains peer-reviewed papers from a June 2011 conference, describing the latest achievements, applications, and trends in civil engineering, architecture, and building materials. In addition to covering traditional construction materials, papers also report on research in advanced materials and green building materials. Other areas explored are environmental architecture, equipment engineering, and energy-saving technologies for construction. Some specific paper topics include the behavior of reinforced concrete subjected to boric acid corrosion in a nuclear power plant, fireproof performance of foam concrete insulation board, the application of glazed hollow beads in thermal insulation, and aerated concrete produced by iron tailings. Other subjects examined include application of thermoelectric generation technology in building-integrated photovoltaics, the use of radar technology in concrete water content testing, temperature crack and control measures of long-span beam-type conversion layers, and detection of destruction in urban pavement. Related topics include policies on recycling of construction waste, and construction equipment life-cycle cost studies. Some papers include b&w images. There is no subject index",

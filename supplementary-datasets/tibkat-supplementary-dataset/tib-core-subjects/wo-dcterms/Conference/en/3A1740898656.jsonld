            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Understanding the manner in which damage evolves in engineering materials, systems or structures is currently the focus of extensive research. The object of the present book is to report recent advances in the areas of damage detection, assessment and quantification. All aspects of the topic are covered, ranging from detailed theoretical analyses to case studies of full-scale structures. Signal processing is still an important theme of the conference. However, some of the emphasis is now placed on damage mechanisms in materials. Also of vital importance, for structural health and condition monitoring, is the optimum choice of measurement strategy; including the specification of sensors. Like the previous such conferences, the objective of the third DAMAS conference held in June 1999, in Dublin is to report upon recent advances in the areas of damage detection, assessment, and quantification in engineering materials. Coverage is broad in the 44 collected papers, from detailed theoretical analyses to case studies of full-scale structures. While signal processing is still an important theme, some of the emphasis has shifted to mechanisms of damage in materials as well as the optimum choice of measurement strategy for structural health and condition monitoring (including the specification of sensors). Replete with graphic representations of sensors, signal configurations, and simulation model results",

            "abstract": "These 425 papers, selected from the 2012 International Conference on Civil, Architectural and Hydraulic Engineering (ICCAHE 2012) held on August 10-12th 2012 in Zhangjiajie (China), present current knowledge related to \"Sustainable Cities Development and Environment\". They are grouped into 15 chapters: Architectural Design and its Theory; Architectural Environment and Equipment Engineering; Indoor Environment; Landscape Planning and Design; Ecological Architecture; Urban Planning and Design; Transportation Planning and Traffic Control; City Ecological Environment; Environmental Engineering, Environmental Protection and Environmental Biology;Management and Engineering Education; Air Environment Control and Architectural Environment Improvement Techniques;Sustainable City and Regional Development;Renewable Energy and Building Energy Saving;Water Purification and Wastewater Treatment;Transport Engineering  This three-volume conference proceedings collects work on sustainable construction presented at an August 2012 conference held in China; cases from Asia illustrate innovations. Volume 1 gathers work on architectural design and its theory, equipment engineering, the indoor environment, landscape planning and design, ecological architecture, urban planning, and transportation planning and traffic control. Some specific topics addressed include low-carbon building and an enhanced cell transmission model for oversaturated two-way arterials. Volume 2 contains work on city environments, environmental engineering and environmental protection, management, and engineering education. Topics examined in this section include lead exposure assessment in children and simulation of environmental control in subways. Volume 3 presents material on architectural environment improvement techniques, sustainable city and regional development, renewable energy, water purification and industrial wastewater treatment, and transport engineering.

                "This book gathers papers presented at the 11th International Conference on Construction in the 21st Century, held in London in 2019. Bringing together a diverse group of government agencies, academics, professionals, and students, the book addresses issues related to construction safety, innovative technologies, lean and sustainable construction, international construction, improving quality and productivity, and innovative materials in the construction industry. In addition, it highlights international collaborations between various disciplines in the areas of construction, engineering, management, and technology. The book demonstrates that, as the industry moves forward in an ever-complex global economy, multi-national collaboration is crucial, and its future growth will undoubtedly depend on international teamwork and alliances.",

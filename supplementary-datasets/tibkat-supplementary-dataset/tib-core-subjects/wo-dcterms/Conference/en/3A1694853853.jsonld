                "This book gathers the outcomes of the second ECCOMAS CM3 Conference series on transport, which addressed the main challenges and opportunities that computation and big data represent for transport and mobility in the automotive, logistics, aeronautics and marine-maritime fields. Through a series of plenary lectures and mini-forums with lectures followed by question-and-answer sessions, the conference explored potential solutions and innovations to improve transport and mobility in surface and air applications. The book seeks to answer the question of how computational research in transport can provide innovative solutions to Green Transportation challenges identified in the ambitious Horizon 2020 program. In particular, the respective papers present the state of the art in transport modeling, simulation and optimization in the fields of maritime, aeronautics, automotive and logistics research. In addition, the content includes two white papers on transport challenges and prospects. Given its scope, the book will be of interest to students, researchers, engineers and practitioners whose work involves the implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) software for the optimal use of roads, including safety and security, traffic and travel data, surface and air traffic management, and freight logistics.",

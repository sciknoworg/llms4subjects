            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).During the past few years, mechanics, solid-state phenomena and engineering materials have played important roles in the progress of human society, and scholarly research in the related fields has accumulated a treasury of accomplishments and has promoted the development of academic studies. Meanwhile, researchers are faced with many problems. This collection of 84 peer-reviewed papers is divided into sections on solid materials, solid mechanics and related topics. The volume will be essential reading for those working in the related areas and will provide the inspiration for future studies and advances.  Drawn from papers delivered at the 2011 International Conference on Mechanics, Solid State and Engineering Materials, held in September 2011 in Hangzhou, China, this collection of eighty-four articles showcases current scholarship in a variety of material engineering disciplines. Divided into sections covering solid materials and solid mechanics, chapters cover a wide variety of topics including advance metallic and non-metallic materials manufacturing, emerging industrial technologies, computer and network control systems and manufacturing analysis and quality control systems. Individual papers include illustrations, tables, equations and graphs and the volume is indexed by both key word and author. Contributors are Chinese researchers and academics from several universities and technical institutions",

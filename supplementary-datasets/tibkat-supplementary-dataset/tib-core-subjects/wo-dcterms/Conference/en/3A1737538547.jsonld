                "\u2018This book adroitly unpacks debates surrounding the issue of migration. It cuts through self-justifying contradictions to reveal the hard choices and real moral dilemmas that rest at the heart of what we have called the migration debate in Europe. In doing so, it offers no easy answers. Instead, it critically reflects upon the policy avenues that have been taken and then signposts the paths ahead that are available to us \u2013 all in the name of justice.\u2019 \u2013Professor Ben Tonra, UCD School of Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin, Ireland \u2018\u201cWe need a fairer approach to migration!\u201d By brilliantly guiding us through the complexities of the contemporary normative debate on migration regulation, this book shows us it is not as simple as that. In times of increasing polarisation of the public discussion, Ceccorulli, Fassi and Lucarelli\u2019s pluralistic understanding of the ethics of migration governance is not just enlightening, but also potentially transformative.\u2019 \u2013Professor Ferruccio Pastore, Director, International and European Forum on Migration Research (FIERI), Italy This book explores the norms, practices, and main actors in the EU Migration System of Governance (EUMSG). Bringing a fresh perspective to the analysis of asylum and migration in Europe, the volume unpacks the European Union\u2019s approach to migration and points to the principles and actions of EU member states. Moreover, it explores the EUMSG\u2019s performance through the lenses of three alternative yet coexistent understandings of justice (non-domination, impartiality, and mutual recognition), thereby overcoming a unilateral ethical viewpoint and moving away from the \u2018open-closed borders\u2019 debate. Michela Ceccorulli is Senior Assistant Professor of International Relations at the University of Bologna, Italy. Enrico Fassi is Assistant Professor of International Relations at the Catholic University in Milan, Italy. Sonia Lucarelli is Associate Professor of International Relations and Pan-European Security at the University of Bologna, Italy."

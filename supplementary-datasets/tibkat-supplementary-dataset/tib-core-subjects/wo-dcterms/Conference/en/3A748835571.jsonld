            "abstract": "This publication contains the proceedings of the 5th international conference on chain and network management in agribusiness and the food industry. Papers will focus on the paradoxes caused by conflicting interests in the fields of economics and ethics, technology and environment, legislation and internationalisation, etc. The modern consumer demands highquality products, in broad assortments throughout the year, and for competitive prices. Society imposes constraints on companies in order to economize on the use of resources, ensure animal-friendly and safe production, and restrict pollution. Together with technological developments and increased international competition, these demands have changed the production, trade, and distribution of food products beyond recognition. Demand is no longer confined to local or regional supply. The food industry is now swiftly becoming an interconnected system with a large variety of complex relationships. This is changing the way food is brought to the market. Currently, even fresh produce shipped from halfway around the world can be offered at competitive prices. These developments are accompanied by national and international regulations and legislation in the area of food quality and safety. In response to these changes, business strategies must now focus not only on traditional economical and technological interests, but also on topical issues such as the safety and healthfulness of food products, animal friendliness, the environment, etc. To effectively address paradoxical demands facing businesses, many problems and opportunities must be approached from a multi-disciplinary perspective, and trade-offs must be made between different aspects of production, trade and the distribution of food",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The aim of special volume was to gather the current knowledge from researchers from institutes and universities from different countries on actual topics of structural integrity of welded structures from the welders\u2019 point of view as well as that of the material testing specialists. A particular attention was concentrated on practical problems coming from the industry.The volume includes 33 scientific papers representing the results obtained in the research and development activities within institutes and universities from Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Romania and Serbia.The topics covered are :Prospects in materials science, nano-mechanics, nano-materials, nano-technologies, computer simulation paradigm, Advanced materials and joints, mechanical and structural characterizationQuantitative non-destructive testing, Fracture mechanics of metallic and non-metallic materials, Materials damage under time-dependent-actions, fatigue, creep, corrosion, Remaining life assessment of industrial equipments, Quality management of materials and welded joints, Damage of metal and non-metal structure.  The biennial conference addresses the structural integrity of welded structures from the perspectives of welders and materials testing specialists. Topics of the 33 selected papers include the structural and mechanical characterization of hard layers obtained by plasma jet thermal spraying, determining and analyzing the dynamic loaded screws by structural analysis fractography and numerical simulation, determining some mechanical characteristics by the vibration testing of welded structures with tubular wire, optimizing the electrode processing methodology for the resistance spot welding of aluminum, deconstructing existing railway and highway bridges, and experimental research regarding the tensile properties of some polypropylene-based biocomposites reinforced with hemp shives",

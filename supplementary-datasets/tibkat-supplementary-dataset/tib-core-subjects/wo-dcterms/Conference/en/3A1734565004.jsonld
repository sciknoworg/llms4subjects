            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This volume consists of a selection of papers, made from among more than 300 submitted by universities and industrial laboratories. All of the papers were subjected to peer-review by at least two expert referees. Selection for this volume depended upon the quality of the paper and its relevance to the thematic topic. This work presents the reader with the most recent advances in the field of abrasive technology: including the mechanics and control of abrasive processes, modeling, simulation and optimization of abrasive processes, green and clean production in abrasive processes, measurement and surface-quality assessment, cooling and coolants, polishing, wheel-truing and dressing, novel abrasive techniques, and novel machining techniques.It will therefore be valuable to production and research engineers, research students and academics working in the field. For production and research engineers, research students, and academics, this volume draws together selected papers from the 15th Conference of Abrasive Technology in Zhengzhou, China, held in August 2009, on recent advances in the field of abrasive technology. Zhao (Henan Polytechnic U., China) compiles 118 papers on topics including the mechanics and control of abrasive processes, modeling, simulation and optimization, green and clean production, measurement and surface-quality assessment, cooling and coolants, polishing, finishing, wheel-truing and dressing, the grinding of different materials such as granite, nanocomposite ceramics, and steel, and new abrasive and machining techniques. Paper authors work in engineering mostly in China",

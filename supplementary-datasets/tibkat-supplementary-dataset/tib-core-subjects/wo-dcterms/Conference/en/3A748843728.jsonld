                "The focus of CESMAS 2010 in Sigtuna is 'Performance diagnosis and purchase examination of elite sport horses'. The multi authored articles deal with a range of complex topics. Performance evaluation, training guidance and management of race horses, sport horses and show jumpers before and after the competitive season is discussed over several chapters. This includes Body Condition scoring and on-track performance diagnosis. Particular attention is given to the optimal management of horses from birth to 2 years of age. Pre-purchase examination recommendations are made, specifically those done in the Netherlands and Germany, including that of the high level jumper. How genetics can help to find the ideal horse by noting positive and negative markers of performance and health is shown to be a valuable assessment tool in this process. Finally, topics such as variations among breeds in predisposition to injury, the role of shoes in horse performance, on track diagnosis of upper airways obstructions and equine osteochondrosis genetic markers are covered in the book. The book is a valuable resource to all who want to make informed decisions in the acquisition process of performance horses and manage them for sports"

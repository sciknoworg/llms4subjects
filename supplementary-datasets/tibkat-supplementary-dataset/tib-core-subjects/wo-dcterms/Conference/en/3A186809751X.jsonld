The book covers a wide range of topics including the theory and design of capital construction facilities, engineering and hydraulic structures; development of innovative solutions in the field of modeling and testing of reinforced concrete, metal and wooden structures, as well as composite structures based on them; investigation of complex dynamic effects on construction objects, and many others directions. Intended for professional builders, designers and researchers. The contributions, which were selected by means of a rigorous international peer-review process, highlight numerous exciting ideas that will spur novel research directions and foster multidisciplinary collaborations.",

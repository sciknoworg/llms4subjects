                "This book contains 58 papers from among the 68 papers presented at the Fifth International Conference on Fibonacci Numbers and Their Applications which was held at the University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland from July 20 to July 24, 1992. These papers have been selected after a careful review by well known referees in the field, and they range from elementary number theory to probability and statistics. The Fibonacci numbers and recurrence relations are their unifying bond. It is anticipated that this book, like its four predecessors, will be useful to research workers and graduate students interested in the Fibonacci numbers and their applications.

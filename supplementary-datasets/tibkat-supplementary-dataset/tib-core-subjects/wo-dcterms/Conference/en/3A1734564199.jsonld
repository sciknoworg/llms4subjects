            "title": "Progress in Fracture and Damage Mechanics : Special topic volume, invited papers only",
            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).This special-topic volume reports on new progress made in the analysis and understanding of fracture and damage mechanics. The Finite Element Method is a well-established analytical tool for theoretical fracture analysis. The development of interface elements which combine aspects of both fracture and damage mechanics has permitted the prediction of both crack initiation and propagation. A number of the papers presented here deal with their use and further development. Substantial progress has also been made in the use of the Boundary Element Method for treating crack problems. The inherent mathematical complexity of this method has resulted in somewhat slower progress than that enjoyed by the Finite Element Method and is still the focus of much research. The volume also presents a number of contributions arising from this field. A topic which is closely related to the study of fracture is structural repair. Although repairs are usually effected after fracture occurs, the structural analyst must still ensure that the repair itself is not prone to cracking or other forms of damage. Two approaches to the study of damage in a repaired structure are described in this special volume.These three aspects, taken together, ensure that even the expert will learn something new from this book. These research papers for materials science and aeronautics engineers discuss new and advanced composite materials for civil aircraft that are less prone to the types of fractures and damage that may result in catastrophic failures. Falzon (aeronautics, Imperial College London) and Aliabadi (aerostructures, Imperial College London) edit these articles that cover such topics as BEM analysis of semipermeable piezoelectric cracks, boundary element analysis of cracked sheets repaired with bonded anisotropic patches and static and fatigue performance of composite adhesives. Many of these studies discuss methods of crack repair, and how adhesive bonding may offer higher rates of failure than mechanical fasteners",

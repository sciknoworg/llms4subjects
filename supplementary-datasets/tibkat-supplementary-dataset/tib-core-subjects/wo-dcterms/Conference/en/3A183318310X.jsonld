                "This book gathers a selection of peer-reviewed papers presented at the 10th International Conference on Fracture Fatigue and Wear (FFW 2022), held in the city of Ghent, Belgium, on August 2\u20133, 2022. The contributions, prepared by international scientists and engineers, cover the latest advances in and innovative applications of fracture mechanics, fatigue of materials, tribology, and wear of materials. In addition, they discuss industrial applications and cover theoretical and analytical methods, numerical simulations, and experimental techniques. The book is intended for academics, including graduate students and researchers, as well as industrial practitioners working in the areas of fracture fatigue and wear."

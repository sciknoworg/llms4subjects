            "abstract": "Wide-bandgap semiconductors, such as silicon carbide and group-III nitrides have attracted increasing attention as promising target materials for high-power, high-frequency and high-temperature electronics use, as well as exploitation as short-wavelength light-emitters.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS). This two-volume set comprehensively documents the present understanding of various topics of scientific and technological interest: such as the growth of bulk crystals, the growth of epitaxial layers, extended and point defects, physical properties, theoretical modeling, surface- and nano-structures, the development of device processing, and the requirements demanded of electronic devices which can operate under extreme conditions and exhibit outstanding performance.This comprehensive work thus offers a superlative overview for those already working in these fields, as well as offering a sound introduction to the subject for those planning to enter them. Selected and peer reviewed, over 350 papers offer scientific treatments of materials used for wide bandgap semiconductors, emphasizing recent developments in the basic science of the materials themselves and the maturing device and processing technologies. They cover silicon carbide (SiC) growth and epitaxial growth, physical properties and characteristics, nanostructures and graphene, processing, devices, and III-nitrides and other related materials. Among specific topics are growing bulk crystal at a constant rate using a new design of resistive furnace, the solution growth of 3C-SiC single crystals by the cold crucible technique, Raman scattering studies of stress distribution around dislocation, the electronic band structure of cubic silicon nanowires, the anisotropic etching of SiC in the mixed gas of chlorine and oxygen, the temperature dependence of plasma chemical vaporization machining of silicon and silicon carbide, the influence of passivation oxide properties on SiC field-plated buried gate MESFETs, a high power-density converter, surface morphology in an AIN epitaxial layer grown on various SiC substrates by the sublimation closed space technique, and diamond doped by hot iron implantation. The two volumes are paged together, and both contain the author index; there is no subject index",

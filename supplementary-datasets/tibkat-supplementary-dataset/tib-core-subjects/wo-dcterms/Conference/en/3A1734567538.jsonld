            "title": "Defects and Diffusion Studied Using PAC Spectroscopy : Special topic volume with invited peer reviewed papers only",
            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).The motivation for this special-topic volume was two-fold. Among the various techniques for probing material properties at the atomic scale, PAC is a somewhat hidden gem. This is partly because PAC requires the use of radioisotopes; thus rendering it almost useless as a non-destructive characterization method. Moreover, there are relatively few PAC isotopes available; so it is not always possible to apply PAC to the most technologically pressing problems. Thus, PAC studies of materials are often more fundamental, and less applied, in nature. One of the goals of this volume was to raise the profile of PAC: in particular, for materials scientists, whose research could well benefit from adding this method to their tool-box. The second goal was to provide a single-source reference which illustrated the applicability of PAC to a wide range of materials. Part 1 consists of a number of comprehensive review articles concerning the technique itself and its state-of-the-art application to magnetic materials, ceramic oxides and nanostructured materials. Part 2 consists of papers which describe ongoing work on TiO2 nanomaterials, L12-structured intermetallic compounds, and wide-bandgap semiconductors. Overall, this is a valuable and unique guide to the subject.  Invited contributors review the literature and report current research on using perturbed angular correlation (PAC) spectroscopy to study defects and diffusion at the atomic scale. The technique is not widely used, partly because it uses radioisotopes, which destroy the subject and are not always available anyway. The topics include impurities in magnetic materials, whether PAC measurements can be used to investigate defects in nano-structures, the volume and surface properties of TiO2 nanomaterials studied by 44Ti(EC)44Sc time differential perturbed angular correlations, and implanted impurities in wide band gap semiconductors",

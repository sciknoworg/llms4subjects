            "abstract": "Engineering design and optimization are important tasks, and activities which are essential for the success of product development and application.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This two-volume book is a collection of 349 peer-reviewed papers that present state-of-the-art research results in the broad areas of engineering design and optimization; including those that are directly related to the design and optimization of engineered products, and those that are related to the design and optimization of engineering processes where the latter are essential to the manufacturing process. The list of relevant topics includes: Engineering Design Theory and Methodology, Product Design and Development, Simulation and Engineering Optimization, Manufacturing Systems Modeling and Optimization, and Machining and Materials Processing Technology. Selected from approximately 500 submissions, 349 peer-reviewed papers from the October 2010 conference are presented in two volumes. As stated in the brief preface, coverage encompasses \"...two aspects of research topics, including those that are directly related to the design and optimization of the engineered products, and those that are related to the design and optimization of the engineering processes.\" Each paper begins with at least a few keywords, which are consolidated at the end as a keyword index. Arrangement of the papers is alphabetical by title (including the unfortunate groups of all papers that begin with the word \"A\" and those that begin with \"The\"), so the keyword index is really the only way to navigate the subject matter (an author index is also supplied). A small sampling of topics to indicate detail and range: parametric design for hydraulic mounting engine, prediction of building deformation caused by subway construction, solar cell surface texturing, and topology optimization on the movable platen of plastic injection machine",

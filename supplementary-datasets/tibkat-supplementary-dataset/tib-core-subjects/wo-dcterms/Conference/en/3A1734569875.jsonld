            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This issue of Advanced Materials Research having the title, Advances in Materials and Systems Technologies III, is a collection of peer-reviewed papers selected from those presented at the 2010 International Conference on Engineering Research and Development: Advances in Engineering, Science and Technology (ICERD2010) held at the University of Benin, Nigeria on September 7\u20139th, 2010. The papers are divided into the chapters: Construction and Structures; Electrical and Electronic Technology; Information and Communication Technology; Manufacturing Systems; Materials Processing; Oil and Gas, Renewable Energy; Solid Minerals Technology; Systems Design and Analysis; Tools, Machines and Equipment; Water, Waste and Environment. The result is an up-to-date overview of the field.  This proceedings volume contains about 60 peer-reviewed papers from a September 2011 conference, grouped in sections on construction and structures, electrical and electronic technology, information and communication technology, manufacturing systems, and materials processing. Other major themes are oil and gas, renewable energy, solid materials technology, systems design and analysis, tools and equipment, and waste and the environment. A number of papers are devoted to alternative energy options, such as production of bio-diesel from palm kernel oil and groundnut oil, an indirect passive solar dryer, and design and testing of a mini-plant for conversion of organic waste to biogas. Other papers deal with rural energy and communication issues, such as rural mobile telephony, rural electrification in Nigeria, modeling declining incomes from non-renewable natural resources, and predicting telephone traffic congestion using multi-layer feedforward neural networks. Some other specific areas examined include small scale sugarcane juice extraction using a screw pressing system, computer-aided design of a power transmission screw, measurement of gamma radiation in automobile workshops, and a novel approach to subsea multiphase solid transport",

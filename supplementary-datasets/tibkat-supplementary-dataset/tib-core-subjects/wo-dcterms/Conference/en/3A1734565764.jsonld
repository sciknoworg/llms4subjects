            "abstract": "This special collection provides up-to-date knowledge concerning the field of functional materials such as shape memory alloys, piezoelectric ceramics and aluminium alloys. The articles therein also deal with recent investigations of quasicrystals and geopolymers: two classes of hybrid material that have attracted great scientific interest, given their unusual properties and potential engineering applications.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).In the first part, the papers address key issues concerning the application of two classes of functional alloy: (i) NiTi alloys, having important applications in the fields of smart structures and bioengineering; and (ii) CuAlBe alloys, as applied to non-welded pipe joints. In both classes, the papers focus upon industrial-scale examples associated with two classical metallurgical processes (electron-beam and conventional melting techniques). In the second part, three articles deal with two hybrid materials: quasicrystals and geopolymers. The former is a class of hybrid material in which a metallic alloy exhibits ceramic properties, such as low thermal and electrical conductivities and a very low frictional coefficient. The latter is a class of inorganic polymers produced from raw material originating from industrial by-products of, for example, the thermoelectric and steel industries.This work provides a handy guide to these rather specialized topics. This work contains selected peer-reviewed papers from the 1st Brazilian Symposium on Functional and Structural Materials, held in August 2009 at Federal University of Paraiba, Brazil. Most of the papers deal with two classes of functional alloys: NiTi alloys and their applications in smart structures and bioengineering, and CuAlBe alloys and their applications in non-welded pipe joints. These papers offer industrial-scale examples associated with two classical metallurgical processes: electron beam and conventional melting techniques. Three other papers deal with two hybrid materials: quasicrystals and geopolymers. Some specific topics include vibration attenuation in an epoxy smart composite beam with embedded NiTi, and stress recovery of constrained NiTi SMA wire for aerospace applications.

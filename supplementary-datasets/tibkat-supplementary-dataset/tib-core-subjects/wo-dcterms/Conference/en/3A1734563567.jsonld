            "abstract": "This work comprises edited versions of papers presented at the 6th Pacific Rim International Conference on Advanced Materials and Processing (PRICM-6), held on Jeju Island, Korea between the 5th and 9th November, 2007. The objectives of PRICM meetings are to foster research and development of advanced materials and processes by providing an international forum within which the world-wide materials community can exchange technical, as well as scientific, information and ideas. Among the more-than 2400 abstracts submitted to the 19 sessions, 904 papers from 30 countries were selected by the session organizers after applying a strict peer-review process.These proceedings will therefore be an invaluable reference tool for researchers, engineers, scientists and end-producers working in the fields of advanced materials and processing. This three-volume set collect 904 papers from the November 2007 Sixth Pacific Rim International Conference on Advanced Materials and Processing, which was organized by the Korean Institute of Metals and Materials and sponsored by the Chinese Society for Metals, the Japan Institute of Metals, the Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society, and the Institute of Materials Engineering Australia. Covering both technical and scientific issues, the papers are organized into sections on advanced ferrous alloys and processing; light metals; intermetallics and high temperature alloys; advanced ceramics; composite materials; advanced forming and processing; advanced melt processing, casting, and joining; magnetic, electronic, and optical materials; thin film materials and processing; amorphous and quasicrystalline materials and nanocrystalline materials; biomaterials, smart materials, and structures; fuel cells and hydrogen storage materials; ecomaterials and porous materials; energetic particles-materials interactions and nuclear materials; modeling and simulation of materials and processes; materials characterization and evaluation; damage evaluation and life assessment; phase transformation and applications; and interfaces and surface engineering. Also included are three plenary papers discussing deformation induced ferrite transformation in microalloyed steels, improvements and innovations in the continuous casting process at POSCO, and TiNi-base and Ti-base shape memory alloys",

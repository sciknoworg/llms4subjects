            "title": "Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Energy : Special topic volume with invited peer reviewed papers only",
            "abstract": "This special topic volume deals with the development of novel solid state electrocatalysts of a high performance to enhance the rates of the hydrogen or oxygen evolution. It contains a description of various types of metals, alloys and composites which have been obtained using electrodeposition in aqueous solutions that has been identified to be a technologically feasible and economically superior technique for the production of the porous electrodes. The goal was to produce papers that would be useful to both the novice and the expert in hydrogen technologies. This volume is intended to be useful to the materials scientist or electrochemist, student or profesional, who is planning studies of solid state electrocatalysts and who may have had little previous experience with electrochemical measurements. Such a reader will find an outline of basic theory and a discussion of experimental techniques and data analysis, with examples and appropriate references. It is hoped that the more advanced reader will also find this volume valuable as a review and summary of the literature up to the time of writing, with a discussion of current theoretical and experimental issues of research activity in the field of hydrogen energy. Keywords: Solid State Electrocatalysts, High Performance, Composite Electrocatalysts, Electrocoatings, Alternative Energy, Energy Engineering. Although hydrogen itself is not an energy source, it is an ideal energy carrier and can be produced on a large scale in an economically profitable manner. Water electrolysis can produce high purity hydrogen and is nonpolluting, however the traditional electrocatalystss, noble metals, cannot be used directly because they are extremely expensive. This book, volume 228 of the Solid State Phenomena series, contains papers on the development of novel solid state electrocatalysts. Topics covered include conventional electrode materials, electrodeposition of composite electrocatalysts, structure of electrode material, electrochemical properties of solid state electrocatalysts and techniques for the characterization of electrode materials. Although the material is designed to be applicable to both novice and expert hydrogen researchers, the writing style and explanations are at a high level. \u2014 Alternative energy\u2014 Energy engineering\u2014 Water resources",

            "abstract": "The 2010 Annual British Society for Strain Measurement Conference is the seventh in the series on Advances in Experimental Mechanics, and the fifth time that the papers have been presented as a volume in the Applied Mechanics and Materials series.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The 61 papers making up this volume reflect strikingly the diverse nature of experimental mechanics. The fourteen sessions address various disciplines: e.g. aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering and state-of-the-art technologies such as biomechanics, novel sensors, and composite and cellular materials. The papers were contributed by workers in both academia and industry; with half of the contributions coming from outside of the UK: thus reflecting the international flavour of this event. This volume will be essential reading for all of those interested in the subject.  The 61 papers represent perspectives of academia and business, and a Wide variety of disciplines where experimental mechanics is practiced. The keynote addresses cover mechanical and transport properties of concrete at high temperature, and the experimental characterization of parameters controlling the compressive failure of pultruded unidirectional carbon fiber composites. A paper from the British Society for Strain Measurement discusses aspects of uncertainty analysis for large nonlinear computational models. Overall themes of the other papers are structural health monitoring, vibration, composite and cellular materials, novel sensor technology, civil engineering, non-linear behavior, fracture and damage, residual stresses, biomechanics, manufacturing processes, impacts and dynamics, identification, and education",

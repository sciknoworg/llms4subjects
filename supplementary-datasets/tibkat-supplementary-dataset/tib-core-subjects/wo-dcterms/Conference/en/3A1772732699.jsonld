                "This book presents selected contributions to the 4th International Workshop on Advanced Dynamics and Model Based Control of Structures and Machines. The workshop, which was held in Linz, Austria in September 2019, continued a series of international workshops \u2014 the Japan-Austria Joint Workshop on Mechanics and Model Based Control of Smart Materials and Structures, the Russia-Austria Joint Workshop on Advanced Dynamics and Model Based Control of Structures and Machines, and the first three editions of the International Workshop on Advanced Dynamics and Model Based Control of Structures and Machines. The chapters cover a broad spectrum of topics in the field of Advanced Structures and Machines both with respect to theoretical aspects as well as applications to contemporary engineering problems."

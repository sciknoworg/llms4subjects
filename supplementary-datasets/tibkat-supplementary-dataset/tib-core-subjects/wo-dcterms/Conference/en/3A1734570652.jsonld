            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).These are the proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Mechatronics and Information Technology (ICMIT 2011), which was held on August 16-19th, 2011, in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, P.R. China. The primary aim of ICMIT 2011 was to share ideas and to discuss new techniques and applications in mechatronics and information technology in order to speed the development of advanced equipment manufacture, within the conference theme of \"mechatronics and information technology for advanced equipment manufacture\". The topics covered by ICMIT 2011 included: Control Theory and Applications, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Actuators and Mechanisms, Communication and Network Systems, Smart Materials and Structures, Ubiquitous Applications, Welfare Engineering, Sensors and Signal/Image Processing, Biomedical Engineering, Embedded Systems, Robotics, Human Interfaces, Mechatronics and MEMS, Information Technology, Intelligent Control and Systems, Condition Monitoring/Fault Diagnosis, Applied Electromagnetics and Mechanics and Power Electronics.  This two-volume set presents papers from an August 2011 conference held in China. Major themes are control theory and applications, magnetic resonance imaging, actuators and mechanisms, communication and network systems, smart materials and structure, and ubiquitous applications. Other themes include sensors and signal/image processing, biomedical engineering, embedded systems, and robotics, in addition to human interfaces, intelligent control, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis, and power electronics. Some specific topics reported include stress analysis of saw blades, fluid finite element analysis for hot-air valve ducts, combinatorial synthesis and evaluation of vanadium oxide films, and film uniformity on vacuum coating by magnetron sputtering. Other areas described include characteristics of chaotic motion based on the wavelet ridge, a second derivative Gaussian algorithm in engine fault simulation, free vibration of a CLD combination cylindrical shell, and modal analysis of a five-layer vertical structure platform. B&w photos and images are included. Han is affiliated with Northeastern University, China",

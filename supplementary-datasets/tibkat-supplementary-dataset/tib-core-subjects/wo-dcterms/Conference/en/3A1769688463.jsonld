                "This book reports on research and developments in human-technology interaction. A special emphasis is given to human-computer interaction, and its implementation for a wide range of purposes such as healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and education, among others. The human aspects are analyzed in detail. Innovative studies related to human-centered design, wearable technologies, augmented, virtual and mixed reality simulation, as well as developments and applications of machine learning and AI for different purposes, represent the core of the book. Emerging issues in business, security, and infrastructure are also critically examined, thus offering a timely, scientifically-grounded, but also professionally-oriented snapshot of the current state of the field. The book is based on contributions presented at the 4th International Conference on Human Interaction and Emerging Technologies: Future Applications, IHIET-AI 2021, held on April 28-30, 2021, in Strasbourg, France. It offers a timely survey and a practice-oriented reference guide to researchers and professionals dealing with design and/or management of the new generation of service systems."

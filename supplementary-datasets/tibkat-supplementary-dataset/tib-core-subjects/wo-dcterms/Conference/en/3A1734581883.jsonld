            "abstract": "This volume includes selected papers presented at the 11th International Conference Structural Integrity of Welded Structures (ISCS15).The event brought together researchers from institutes and universities from different countries in order to discuss actual topics of structural integrity of welded and jointed structures from the practical point of view as well as that of the material testing specialists. A particular attention was given to practical problems coming from the industry. The volume includes 46 selected papers from the 54 full papers that were submitted. The authors highlight the results of their own research and development activity, carried out in the frame of their institutes and universities from Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Israel. Keyword: steel, automotive, brazing, crack, failure, mechanical properties, microstructure, structural integrity, vibration tests, welding The proceedings contains more than 40 selected papers from the 11th International Conference Structural Integrity of Welded Structures held in Timisoara, Romania in June 2015. General topics covered are welded structure stability; advanced methods and new trends in non-destructive testing; prospects in materials science, nanotechnology and computer simulation; advanced materials; mechanical and structural characterization; fracture mechanics; materials damage under time-dependent-actions; remaining life assessment of industrial equipment; quality management of materials and welded joints; and structural damage. \u2014 Civil engineering\u2014 Engineering\u2014 Mechanical engineering",

            "abstract": "This massive compendium presents full coverage of the current state of knowledge with regard to manufacturing science and engineering, focusing on Advanced Mechanical Design. The 525 peer-reviewed papers are grouped into 17 chapters: Materials Design; Mechanical Dynamics and Its Applications; Mechanical Transmission Theory and Applications; Mechanical Reliability Theory and Engineering; Theory and Application of Friction and Wear; Vibration, Noise Analysis and Control; Dynamic Mechanical Analysis, Optimization and Control; Innovative Design Methodology; Product Life-Cycle Design; Intelligent Optimization Design; Structural Strength and Robustness; Reverse Engineering; Chapter 13: Green Design and Manufacturing; Chapter 14: Design for Sustainability; Chapter 15: New Mechanisms and Robotics; Complex Electro-Mechanical System Design; Advanced CAE Technique.  This three-volume set presents selected, peer-reviewed papers from a March 2012 conference, shedding light on the latest work in mechanical design. Volume 1 contains chapters on materials design, and mechanical dynamics and its applications. Some specific chapter topics include numerical analysis of a slope stabilized with anchors, and dynamic analysis of space structure deployment with transient thermal load. Volume 2 has chapters devoted to mechanical transmission theory and applications, mechanical reliability theory and engineering, theory and application of friction and wear, vibration and noise analysis, dynamical mechanical analysis, and innovative design methodology. Some chapter topics are suspension parameters of cars, and kinematics simulation for design of a demolition robot. Volume 3 contains chapters on product life cycle design, intelligent optimization design, structural strength and robustness, reverse engineering, green design and manufacturing, design for sustainability, robotics, and complex electro-mechanical system design. Specific subjects include performance calculation of a mill hydraulic loading system, de-icing technology for electric transmission lines, and gear stress analysis and discrete optimization for a wheel-legged rover. The book is illustrated with b&w photos, drawings, and diagrams. Editor Chen is affiliated with Fujian University of Technology, China",

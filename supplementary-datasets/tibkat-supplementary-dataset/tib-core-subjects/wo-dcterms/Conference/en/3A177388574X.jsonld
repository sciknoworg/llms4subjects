                "This is the second in a series of \"International Workshops on Electron Correlations and Materials Properties. \" The aim of this series of workshops is to provide a periodic (triennial) and in-depth assessment of advances in the study and understanding of the effects that electron-electron interactions in solids have on the determination of measurable properties of materials. The workshop is structured to include exposure to experimental work, to phenomenology, and to ab initio theory. Since correlation effects are pervasive the workshop aims to concentrate on the identification of promising developing methodology, experimental and theoretical, addressing the most critical frontier issues of electron correlations on the properties of materials. This series of workshops is distinguished from other topical meetings and conferences in that it strongly promotes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of correlations, involving the fields of quantum chemistry, physics, and materials science. The First Workshop was held June 28-July 3, 1998, and a proceedings of the workshop was published by KluwerlPlenum. The Second Workshop was held June 24- 29,2001, and this volume contains the proceedings of that scientific meeting. Through the publications of proceedings, the workshop attempts to disseminate the information gathered during the discussions held at the Workshop to the wider scientific community, and to establish a record of advances in the field.",

            "abstract": "This volume in the Bioceramics series includes the papers selected for the 21st International Symposium on Ceramics in Medicine held in B\u00fazios, Brazil, on the 21-24 October 2008.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The Bioceramics 21 Proceedings includes a section which is devoted to theoretical modelling; an important and new issue which involves several fields of knowledge. This trend is reflected by the high number of papers involving both biological and materials sciences. Following the evolution of regenerative medicine, a third generation of bioceramics is represented in these Proceedings by the variety of papers on tissue engineering, nanotechnology and smart materials. The contents are grouped into: I - Bioceramics Certification: In Vitro, Pre-Clinical and Clinical Evaluation, II - Bioceramics Functionalization: Biomolecule Interactions, III - Biocompatible Glasses and Glass-Ceramic Composites, IV - Bio-inert Ceramics and Tough Ceramics, V - Biomineralization and Biomimetics, VI - Bone Grafts and Cements, VII - Coatings, Films and Surface Activation on Metals, VIII - Composites and Hybrid Materials, IX - Drug Delivery System, X - Metal Uptake: Phosphate-Based Materials for Health and Environmental Applications, XI - Nanostructured Bioceramics, XII - Porous Bioceramics Scaffolds and Tissue Engineering, XIII - Theoretical Modelling of Bioceramics.This work will therefore be invaluable to materials scientists, bio-engineers, molecular and cellular biologists, bone biologists and clinicians. In this valuable contribution to the field of bioceramics, ceramics used in the field of medicine, Prado (Military Institute of Engineering, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Zavaglia (mechanical engineering, U. Estadual de Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil) introduce selected papers from a symposium at the Annual Meeting of the International Society for Ceramics in Medicine (ISCM) held from October 21-24, 2008. These proceedings represent a new generation of bioceramics in regenerative medicine with papers on nanotechnology, tissue engineering (e.g., bone scaffolds), and biocompatible \"smart\" materials for health and environmental applications, and also present a section devoted to the important new multidisciplinary area of theoretical modeling of bioceramics. The volume includes a CD-ROM with the full papers, numerous illustrations, and lists of the ISCM organizing committees and the bioceramics symposia held since 1988",

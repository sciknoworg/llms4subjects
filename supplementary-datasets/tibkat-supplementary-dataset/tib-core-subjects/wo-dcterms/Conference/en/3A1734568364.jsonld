            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The purpose of this special collection was to strengthen national academic exchanges and cooperation in the field, to promote the rapid development of machinery, materials science and engineering applications, to improve China's machinery, materials science and engineering in the sense of academic status and international influence and to play an active role in reducing the distance between domestic and world-class norms. In accomplishing this, the present book succeeds admirably.  The conference was called to promote the development of links between mechanical engineering and materials science, between academic with commercial spheres, and between China and the rest of the world. Of over 500 papers submitted, about 213 were accepted and are presented here. Among the topics are the phase field simulation of parameters affecting dendrite growth in a forced flow, submicron tungsten powder prepared through the circulatory oxidation-reduction method, the coupling effect analysis of three dimensional interior structural-acoustic problems using wave-based methods, the electrical control system of a semi-automatic figuration machine of the grind material, the best assessment subject for the environmental protection performance of local parties and government officials, and the simulated heat-affected zone of ship steel. The two volumes are paged consecutively and indexed together",

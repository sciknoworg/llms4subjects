            "abstract": "The 2010 International Conference on Applied Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering (ICAMME 2010), was held in Changsha (China) on September 8th and 9th, 2010. The goal of these proceedings was to bring together researchers from academia and industry, as well as technologists, to share ideas, problems and solutions related to the multifaceted aspects of applied mechanics and mechanical engineering. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The 477 peer-reviewed papers are grouped into 12 chapters: Session One: Computational Mechanics and Applied Mechanics, Session Two: Mechanical Design, Session Three: Materials Science and Processing, Session Four: System Dynamics and Simulation, Session Five: PC Guided Design and Manufacture, Session Six: Other Related Topics, Session Seven: Computational Mechanics and Applied Mechanics, Session Eight: Mechanical Design, Session Nine: Materials Science and Processing, Session Ten: System Dynamics and Simulation, Session Eleven: PC-Guided Design and Manufacture, Session Twelve: Other Topics. This volume thus provides an invaluable insight into the current state-of-the-art of this field.  Well over 400 papers are contained in the three volumes, written by researchers and practitioners in academia, government, and business from around the world. No mention is made of previous conferences, but one is projected for 2011, so this may be the first in an ongoing series. Among the areas covered are computational and applied mechanics, mechanical design, material science and processing, system dynamics and simulation, and personal computer guided design and manufacture. Among the topics are a rod-explosive technique for testing structural responses induced by x-ray blow-off impulses, the numerical simulation calculation of ship submarine oil spill under a complicated ocean environment, the global solution of a viscoelastic thin rectangular plate equation, a new model for forecasting the location of the next crime, gear crack assessment using correlation dimension, the asymptotical stability analysis of switched descriptor systems, and the influence of power supply current in electrical methods for detecting landfill leakage. The three volumes are paged and indexed together",

                "This book gathers a selection of papers presented at the 4th International Scientific Conference \u201cEnvironmental Challenges in Civil Engineering\u201d, ECCE 2020, , Opole, Poland, held on April 20-22, 2020, in Opole, Poland. The chapters, written by an international group of experts, report on advanced finding in structural material behaviour, and novel construction technologies and procedures, with a focus on strategies to foster sustainable civil engineering. Offering a good balance of theory and practice, and covering both technical, as well as legal and organization aspects in civil engineering and architectural projects, this book offers extensive information on the state-of-the art and a timely snapshot of current challenges in planning construction projects and structural interventions in accordance with the principles of environmental protection.",

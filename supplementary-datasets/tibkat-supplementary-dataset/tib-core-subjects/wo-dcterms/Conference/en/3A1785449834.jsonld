                "This book covers the topics such as online learning methodologies, case studies, new technologies in learning (such as virtual reality, augmented reality, holograms, and artificial intelligence), adaptive learning, and project-based learning. New technologies provide us with new opportunities to create new learning experiences, leveraging research from a variety of disciplines along with imagination and creativity. The Learning Ideas Conference was created to bring researchers, practitioners, and others together to discuss, innovate, and create. The Learning Ideas Conference 2021 was the 14th annual conference and the first under its new name (following on its predecessors, the International Conference on E-Learning in the Workplace and the International Conference on Interactive Collaborative and Blended Learning). The conference was held online from June 14-18, 2021, and included two special tracks: The ALICE (Adaptive Learning via Interactive, Collaborative and Emotional Approaches) Special Track and a track entitled Building a University of Tomorrow, from the Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) in China. The papers included in this book may be of interest to researchers in pedagogy and learning theory, university faculty members and administrators, learning and development specialists, user experience designers, and others.",

            "abstract": "These are the proceedings of the 2012 International Conference on Chemical Engineering and Advanced Materials (CEAM 2012). The conference provided a forum for the discussion of new developments, recent progress and innovations in chemical engineering and advanced materials, and addressed all aspects of these fields. Emphasis was placed on current and future challenges in research and development for both academia and industry; especially long-term fundamental research aimed at discovering novel phenomena, processes and tools.  In this four-volume set, Li (Guangxi U., China) et al. collect 674 papers from the Second International Conference on Chemical Engineering and Advanced Materials (CEAM 2012), held in July 2012, in Guangzhou, China. Contributed by engineers and scientists primarily from China, papers focus on current and future challenges in research and development in academia and industry in chemical engineering and advanced materials, emphasizing long-term, fundamental research aimed at discovering novel phenomena, processes, and tools. They cover fine and specialty chemicals; catalysts and catalytic reactions; energy development and energy chemical engineering; clean production and green chemical technology; polymer engineering; energy conservation and emission reduction; chemical process intensification; bio-pharmaceuticals and chemical pharmaceuticals; biological chemistry and technology; extraction and separation of natural products; food safety and inspecting technology; electrochemistry; waste disposal and environmental chemicals; exploitation, conservation, and utilization of water resources; chemical thermodynamics and kinetics; chemical metallurgy and mining explorations; chemical process system and information engineering; chemical machinery and equipment; paper and fiber engineering; and measurement technology and instruments",

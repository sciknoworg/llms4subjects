                "This book delves into various solution paradigms such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, wavelet transforms, evolutionary computing, swarm intelligence. During the last decade, novel solution technologies based on human and species intelligence have gained immense popularity due to their flexible and unconventional approach. New analytical tools are also being developed to handle big data processing and smart decision making. The idea behind compiling this work is to familiarize researchers, academicians, industry persons and students with various applications of intelligent techniques for producing sustainable, cost-effective and robust solutions of frequently encountered complex, real-world problems in engineering and science disciplines. The practical problems in smart grids, communication, waste management, elimination of harmful elements from nature, etc., are identified, and smart and optimal solutions are proposed. ."

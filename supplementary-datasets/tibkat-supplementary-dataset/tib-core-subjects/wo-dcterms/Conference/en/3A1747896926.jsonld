                "This book contains the topics of artificial intelligence and deep learning that do have much application in real-life problems. The concept of uncertainty has long been used in applied science, especially decision making and a logical decision must be made in the field of uncertainty or in the real-life environment that is formed and combined with vague concepts and data. The chapters of this book are connected to the new concepts and aspects of decision making with uncertainty. Besides, other chapters are involved with the concept of data mining and decision making under uncertain computations."

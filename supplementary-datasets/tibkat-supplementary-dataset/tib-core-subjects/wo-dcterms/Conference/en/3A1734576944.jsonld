            "abstract": "Collection of selected, peer reviewed papers from the 2014 International Conference on Frontiers of Advanced Materials and Engineering Technology (FAMET 2014), March 28-29, 2014, Hongkong. The 447 papers are grouped as follows: Chapter 1: Materials Engineering and Science,Chapter 2: Mechanical, Construction, Manufacturing Engineering and Applied Research,Chapter 3: Information Technologies, Control, Monitoring and Data Processing, Chapter 4: Product Design, Management and Environmental Research, Chapter 5: Bio and Medical Research. Keyword: Materials Engineering and Science, Mechanical, Construction, Manufacturing Engineering and Applied Research, Information Technologies, Control, Monitoring and Data Processing, Product Design, Management and Environmental Research, Bio and Medical Research This three-volume set collects selected papers from a March 2014 conference held in Hong Kong, written by researchers, engineers, academicians, and industrial professionals from around the world, especially Asia. The contributors present research results and application experiences in materials science, mechanical design, and manufacturing engineering. Volume one contains sections on materials engineering and science, and mechanical, construction, and manufacturing engineering and applied research. Volume two contains further work on mechanical, construction, and manufacturing engineering and applied research, plus papers on information technologies, control, monitoring, and data processing. Volume three contains additional papers on information technologies, control, monitoring, and data processing, along with papers on product design, management, environmental research, and bio and medical research. Some specific topics treated include green technology, \"smart city\" construction, architectural parametric design, an aquatic logistics model based on supply chain management, improvement of a headphone speaker production line, the effects of juglone on the migration of human ovarian cancer cells, and the design and implementation of an oilfield heterogeneous data-integration model based on ontology. B&w images are included. \u2014 Engineering\u2014 Materials science",

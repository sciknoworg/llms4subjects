                "Over the past years enormous progress has been made in the microsystems area in transforming research results into marketable products. Nearly all economic sectors did benefit from these developments. Automobiles today are inconceivable without microsystems. New and improved functions in the car related to safety, performance, comfort and emission reduction \u2013 being in many cases the unique selling propositions of a new automobile product \u2013 are in the majority of cases based on microsystems. ABS, break assistance, stability control and further safety features, applications in air-condition systems, powertrain and engine management are only some examples for the indispensable role of microsystems in automobiles. Microsystems and their underlying technologies are in many cases even the driving forces in order to satisfy new customers\u2019 requirements. This book published in occasion of the International Forum of Advanced Microsystems for Automotive Applications 2004 reflects the state-of-the-art of automotive R&D particularly in the area of automotive safety. By that it follows the priorities set by the European automotive industry and public authorities as for example the European Commission or the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research. The core of the book consists of the papers presented at the 8th AMAA international conference, taking place in March 2004 in Berlin, a now regular event dealing with a modern and promising field. The contributions to AMAA 2004 focus on automotive safety (both preventive and protective), powertrain (online measurement and control of engine and transmission subsystems), comfort and HMI (systems to enhance the comfort of passengers and human machine interface issues), and the networked vehicle (all aspects of intra car systems and ambient communication networks). Additional information is available on www.amaa.de."

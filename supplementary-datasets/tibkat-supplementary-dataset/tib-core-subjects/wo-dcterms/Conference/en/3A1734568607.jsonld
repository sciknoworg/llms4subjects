This four-volume set collects about 600 short papers from the 2011 International Conference on Advanced Engineering Materials and Technology, held in July 2011 in Sanya, China. Topics include surface engineering/coatings; modeling, analysis, and simulation of manufacturing processes; materials forming and machining; welding and joining; mechanical behavior and fracture; material design of computer aided technology; tooling testing and evaluation of materials; microwave processing of materials; and laser processing technology. Others consists of theory and application of friction and wear; dynamic mechanical analysis, optimization, and control; thermal engineering theory and applications; precision manufacturing technology and measurements; waste engineering and management; mechanical dynamics and its applications; vibration, noise analysis, and control; mechanical reliability theory and engineering; and CAD/CAM/CAE. The later sections address product design and development; engineering optimization; measure control technologies and intelligent systems; mechanical control and information processing technology; transmission and control of fluid; quality monitoring and control of the manufacturing process; automation technology and production processes; advanced manufacturing technology; nano and micro-electro-mechanical system technology and devices; system analysis and industrial engineering; and production and operation management. Contributors work in engineering, materials science, and related fields around the world",

                "This volume contains extended abstracts outlining selected presentations delivered by participants of the joint international multidisciplinary workshop MURPHYS-HSFS-2018 (MUltiRate Processes and HYSteresis; Hysteresis and Slow-Fast Systems), dedicated to the mathematical theory and applications of the multiple scale systems, the systems with hysteresis and general trends in the dynamical systems theory. The workshop was jointly organized by the Centre de Recerca Matem\u00e0tica (CRM), Barcelona, and the Collaborative Research Center 910, Berlin, and held at the Centre de Recerca Matem\u00e0tica in Bellaterra, Barcelona, from May 28th to June 1st, 2018. This was the ninth workshop continuing a series of biennial meetings started in Ireland in 2002, and the second workshop of this series held at the CRM. Earlier editions of the workshops in this series were held in Cork, Pechs, Suceava, Lutherstadt and Berlin. The collection includes brief research articles reporting new results, descriptions of preliminary work, open problems, and the outcome of work in groups initiated during the workshop. Topics include analysis of hysteresis phenomena, multiple scale systems, self-organizing nonlinear systems, singular perturbations and critical phenomena, as well as applications of the hysteresis and the theory of singularly perturbed systems to fluid dynamics, chemical kinetics, cancer modeling, population modeling, mathematical economics, and control. The book is intended for established researchers, as well as for PhD and postdoctoral students who want to learn more about the latest advances in these highly active research areas"

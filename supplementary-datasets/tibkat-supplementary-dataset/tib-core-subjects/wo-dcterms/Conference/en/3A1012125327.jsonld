                "This book contains selected papers presented during technical and plenary sessions at the World Renewable Energy Congress, the world\u2019s premier conference on renewable energy and sustainable development. All papers were rigorously peer reviewed.The Congress, held at Murdoch University in Perth, Western Australia from February 5 -9, 2017, with the theme of \u201cTransition Towards 100% Renewable Energy\u201d, featured keynote speakers and parallel technical sessions highlighting technical, policy, and investment progress towards achieving 100% renewable energy ranging in scale from households to cities to large regions, with a focus on the challenges and opportunities transforming the global energy systems. The book highlights contributions from thought leaders involved in the supply, distribution, consumption, and development of sustainable energy sources.",

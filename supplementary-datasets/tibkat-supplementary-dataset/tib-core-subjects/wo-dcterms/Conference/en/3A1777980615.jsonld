                "On August 24-25, 2015, bridge engineers from all over the world gathered at the 8th New York City Bridge Conference to discuss and share experiences on the construction and maintenance of sustainable bridge structures. This volume contains select papers that were presented at the conference. The peer-reviewed papers are valuable contributions and of archival quality in bridge engineering",

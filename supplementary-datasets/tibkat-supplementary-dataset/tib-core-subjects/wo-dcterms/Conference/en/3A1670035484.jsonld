                "This book addresses the latest research advances, innovations, and applications in the field of urban drainage and water management as presented by leading researchers, scientists and practitioners from around the world at the 11th International Conference on Urban Drainage Modelling (UDM), held in Palermo, Italy from 23 to 26 September, 2018. The conference was promoted and organized by the University of Palermo, Italy and the International Working Group on Data and Models, with the support of four of the world\u2019s leading organizations in the water sector: the International Water Association (IWA), International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR), Environmental & Water Resources Institute (EWRI) - ASCE, and the International Environmental Modelling and Software Society (iEMSs). The topics covered are highly diverse and include drainage and impact mitigation, water quality, rainfall in urban areas, urban hydrologic and hydraulic processes, tools, techniques and analysis in urban drainage modelling, modelling interactions and integrated systems, transport and sewer processes (incl. micropollutants and pathogens), and water management and climate change. The conference\u2019s primary goal is to offer a forum for promoting discussions amongst scientists and professionals on the interrelationships between the entire water cycle, environment and society",

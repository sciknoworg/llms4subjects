                "This book consists of selected and peer-reviewed papers presented at 2022 4th International Conference on Big Data Engineering and Technology (BDET), held during April 22\u201324, 2022, in Singapore. As IT infrastructure and data management technologies have become critical assets and capabilities for today\u2019s enterprises, this book aims to be part of the effort in contributing to their development. In particular, the BDET conference series aims to provide the much needed forum for researchers and practitioners across the world who are actively engaged in advancing research and raising awareness of the many challenges in the diverse field of big data engineering and technology to share their research outcomes and bounce ideas off their international colleagues. Over the last few years, the conference series has brought together the latest developments of novel theory in big data, algorithm and applications, emerging standards for big data, big data infrastructure, MapReduce and cloud computing, big data visualization, big data curation and management, big data semantics, scientific discovery and intelligence, which collectively form parts of the cyber-physical systems of interest. It is hoped that the book will prove useful to students, researchers, and professionals working in the field of big data engineering and applications in cyber-physical systems.",

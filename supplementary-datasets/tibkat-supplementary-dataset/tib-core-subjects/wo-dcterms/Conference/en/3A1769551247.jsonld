                "This book briefly covers internationally contributed chapters with artificial intelligence and applied mathematics-oriented background-details. Nowadays, the world is under attack of intelligent systems covering all fields to make them practical and meaningful for humans. In this sense, this edited book provides the most recent research on use of engineering capabilities for developing intelligent systems. The chapters are a collection from the works presented at the 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Applied Mathematics in Engineering held within 09-10-11 October 2020 at the Antalya, Manavgat (Turkey). The target audience of the book covers scientists, experts, M.Sc. and Ph.D. students, post-docs, and anyone interested in intelligent systems and their usage in different problem domains. The book is suitable to be used as a reference work in the courses associated with artificial intelligence and applied mathematics. ."

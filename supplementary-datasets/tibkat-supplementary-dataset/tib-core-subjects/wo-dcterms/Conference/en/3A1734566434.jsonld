            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The increased use of advanced materials in high-efficiency structures \u2013 electronic devices, medical equipment, aircraft and vehicles \u2013 requires an improved reliability, increased resistance to breakdown, and better failure and life-span forecasting for a wide variety of loading conditions. The development of materials having advanced structural properties is becoming a key factor in industrial and technological progress. The aim of this special collection was to provide a forum where engineers, researchers, scientists and industrial experts could present their work and discuss the current situation with regard to advanced and associated technologies, experimental techniques, numerical analysis and recent developments in the field of advanced materials. The wide-ranging list of topics includes: The Effect of Fiber Treatment on the Fiber Strength and Fiber/Matrix Interface of Hemp-Reinforced Polypropylene Composites, Mechanisms of Poly (PhenyleneSulfide) Thermal Degradation in Air, Chemical Structure Influence of Silicone Adhesives on the Curing Process, Dispersion Improvement of Carbon Nanotubes in Epoxy Resin Using Amphiphilic Block Copolymers, DGEBA and Novolac Adhesive Solutions between Ceramic and Steel Substrates, Shear Test in CFRP Full-Field Measurement and Finite Element Analysis, Thermo-Mechanical Behaviour of Raffinate Resulting from Aqueous Extraction of Sunflower Plants in Twin-Screw Extruder, Failure Mechanisms of Thin Hard Coatings Submitted to Repeated Impacts, Identification of Sn96.5Ag3.5 Law Behavior with the Scatter of the Parameters, Numerical Modeling of Chemical and Thermal Coupling in a Silicon Carbide Based Heat Exchanger Reactor, Digital Image Stereo-Correlation Applied to the Identification of Elastomers, Lifetime and Reliability Assessment of AlN Substrates Used in Harsh Aeronautic Environments, Prediction of Lifetime in Static Fatigue at High Temperatures for Ceramic Matrix Composites, On-Line ANN-Based Approach for Quality Estimation in Resistance Spot Welding, Stability Prediction in Turning Flexible Components, Geometric and Kinematic Modelling of a New Parallel Kinematic Machine Tool, Links Between Machining Parameters and Surface Integrity in Drilling Ni-Superalloy and Control of Chatter by Spindle Speed Variation in High-Speed Milling.The wealth of subjects covered will make this book an inexhaustible source of potential solutions",

            "abstract": "Collection of selected, peer reviewed papers from the 4th International Conference on Management of Manufacturing Systems (MMS 2014), October 1-3, 2014, High Tatras, Slovakia. The 40 papers are grouped as follows: Chapter 1: Modern Trends in Manufacturing Management; Chapter 2: Machines and Equipments of Manufacturing Systems; Chapter 3: Logistics and RFID in Manufacturing Systems; Chapter 4: Researching and Designing of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Keyword: management, automotive, flow-shop, rfid, logistic, manufacturing systems This work gathers 41 papers from an October 2014 conference held in Slovakia, describing the latest work in advanced manufacturing systems, encompassing the manufacture of high-tech products and the use of innovative techniques in manufacturing. Papers are organized into four sections on modern trends in manufacturing management, machines and equipment for manufacturing systems, logistics and RFID, and researching and designing industrial and manufacturing systems. Some specific topics examined include production diversification strategies, product quality improvement using simulation tools, design policies in virtual cellular manufacturing systems, and the application of RFID technology in public transportation. B&w photos and images are included. The book\u2019s audience includes advanced students, researchers, and engineers involved in advanced manufacturing systems and operations management. \u2014 Engineering\u2014 Engineering -- Research\u2014 Mechanical engineerin",

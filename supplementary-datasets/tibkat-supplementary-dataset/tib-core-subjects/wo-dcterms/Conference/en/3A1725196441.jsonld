                "This book contains the selected and peer-reviewed manuscripts that were presented in the Conferences on Multidisciplinary Engineering and Technology (COMET 2019), held at the University Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Spanish Institute (UniKL MSI), Kedah, Malaysia from September 18 to 19, 2019. The aim of COMET 2019 was to present current and on-going research being carried out in the field of mechanical, manufacturing, electrical and electronics and general studies for engineering and technology. Besides, this book also contains the manuscripts from the System Engineering and Energy Laboratory (SEELAB) research cluster, UniKL which is actively doing research mainly focused on artificial intelligence, metal air batteries, advanced battery materials and energy material modelling fields. This volume is the third edition of the progress in engineering technology, Advanced Structured Materials which provides in-depth ongoing research activities among academia of UniKL MSI. Lastly, it is hoped to foster cooperation among organisations and research in the covered fields.",

                "This book contains works on mathematical and simulation modeling of processes in various domains: ecology and geographic information systems, IT, industry, and project management. The development of complex multicomponent systems requires an increase in accuracy, efficiency, and adequacy while reducing the cost of their creation. The studies presented in the book are useful to specialists who involved in the development of real events models-analog, management and decision-making models, production models, and software products. Scientists can get acquainted with the latest research in various decisions proposed by leading scholars and identify promising directions for solving complex scientific and practical problems. The chapters of this book contain the contributions presented on the 16th International Scientific-practical Conference, MODS, June 28\u2013July 01, 2021, Chernihiv, Ukraine.",

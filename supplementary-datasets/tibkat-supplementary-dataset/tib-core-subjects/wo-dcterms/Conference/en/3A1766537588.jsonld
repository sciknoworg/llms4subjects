                "This book presents cutting-edge research and developments in the field of medical and biological engineering. It gathers the proceedings of the International Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering, CMBEBIH 2021, held partly virtually, partly physically, on April 21\u201324, 2021, from and in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Focusing on the goal to \u2018Stay Focused\u2019, contributions report on both basic and applied research in a wide range of related fields, such as biomedical signal processing, medical physics and imaging, biosensors and micro/nanotechnologies, biomaterials, biomechanics and robotics, cardiorespiratory, endocrine and neural systems engineering. Novel models, methods and technologies for bio- and health informatics, as well as applications of machine learning and AI in health care, and advances in genetic engineering are also highlighted. All in all, this book provides academics and professionals with novel, practical solutions to solve the current problems in biomedical research and applications, and a source of inspiration for improving medicine and health care in the future. .",

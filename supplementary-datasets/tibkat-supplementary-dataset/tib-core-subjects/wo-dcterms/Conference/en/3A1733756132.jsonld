                "This proceedings of the 13th World Congress on Engineering Asset Management covers a range of topics that are timely, relevant and practically important in the modern digital era towards safer, cost effective, efficient, and secure engineered assets such as production and manufacturing plants, process facilities, civil structures, equipment, machinery, and infrastructure. It has compiled some pioneering work by domain experts of the global Engineering Asset Management community representing both public and private sectors. The professional coverage of the book includes: Asset management in Industry 4.0; Standards and models; Sustainable assets and processes; Life cycle perspectives; Smart and safer assets; Applied data science; Workplace safety; Asset health; Advances in equipment condition monitoring; Critical asset processes; and Innovation strategy and entrepreneurship The breadth and depth of these state-of-the-art, comprehensive proceedings make them an excellent resource for asset management practitioners, researchers and academics, as well as undergraduate and postgraduate students.",

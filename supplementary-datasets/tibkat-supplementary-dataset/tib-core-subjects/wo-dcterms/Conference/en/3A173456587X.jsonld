            "abstract": "Materials processing is an important and essential step in the production of useful products, and is one of the major wealth-generating activities. With the increasing demand for the production of high precision, high integrity and high density devices and systems in modern life, materials processing has become more important than ever before. Following on from the previous eight publications in the series, \"Asia-Pacific Conference on Materials Processing\", this volume presents the latest developments in this field, and a new understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The volume consists of a collection of 124 peer-reviewed papers contributed by experts from all over the world. The topics covered include: new developments and applications in materials forming, subtractive, additive and joining processes, processing of advanced materials such as composites, polymers, semiconductors and bio-materials, and new development in the micro/nano-fabrication of engineering materials.This work will provide a valuable reference source for researchers in the materials processing field who wish to deepen their understanding of the underlying mechanisms and thereby create new and practical technologies, systems and processes. It should also be particularly useful for practising engineers in materials processing who are responsible for maintaining efficient and effective operations. This volume contains 124 selected, peer-reviewed papers from the 9th Asia-Pacific Conference on Materials Processing held in Sydney, Australia, in June 2010. Topics include new developments and applications in materials processing; subtractive, additive, and joining processes; processing of advanced materials, and new developments in micro/nano fabrication for engineering materials. Editors are Wang and Mathew (U. of New South Wales, Australia), Li (National U, of Singapore), and Huang and Zhu (Shandong U., China)",

                "th The papers appearing in this book were originally presented at the 9 Virginia Tech/MPRG Symposium on Wireless Personal Communications. The Symposium on Wireless Communications, which is an annual event for Virginia Tech, was held on June 2-4, 1999. The 1999 symposium was co-sponsored by MPRG, the Division of Continuing Education, University International Programs, and the MPRG Industrial Affiliate Sponsors. Much of the success of our annual symposium, as well as the success of MPRG's research program, is due to the support of our industrial affiliates. Their support allows us to serve the wireless community through research, education and outreach programs. At the time of the 1999 symposium, the MPRG affiliates program included the following organizations: Army Research Office, AT&T Corporation, Bellsouth Cellular Corporation, Comcast Cellular Communications, Inc. , Datum, Inc. , Ericsson, Inc. , Grayson Wireless, Hewlett-Packard Company, Honeywell, Inc. , Hughes Electronics Corporation, ITT Industries, Lucent Technologies, Motorola, National Semiconductor, Nokia, Nortel Networks, Qualcomm, Inc. , Radix Technologies, Inc. , Salient 3 Communications, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Southwestern Bell, Tantivy Communications, Tektronix, Inc. , Telcordia Technologies, Texas Instruments, TRW, Inc. , and the Watkins-Johnson Company As can be seen from the Table of Contents, the papers included in this book are divided into six sections. The first five of these correspond to symposium sessions, and cover the following topics: Propagation and Channel Modeling (4 papers), Antennas (6 papers), Multiuser Detection (3 papers), Radio Systems and Technology (4 papers), and Wireless Data (3 papers).",

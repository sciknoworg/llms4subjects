            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This special volume brings together the latest advances in, and applications of, mechatronics and materials processing. It comprises 523 papers selected from the some 1000 papers originally submitted by universities and industrial concerns all over the world. The papers specifically cover the topics of manufacturing technology and processing, materials science and technology, mechatronics and automation. All of the papers were peer-reviewed, by selected experts, and chosen for their quality and relevance. This work will provide readers with a broad overview of the latest advances in the field of mechatronics and materials processing. It will also constitute a valuable reference work for researchers in the fields of mechatronics and materials processing.  A November 2011 conference offered a forum for engineers and scientists to present research results and applications in the field of mechatronics and materials processing. All of the peer-reviewed papers presented in this three-volume set have been reviewed by two expert referees. Volume 1 presents the latest work on manufacturing technology and processing. Some specific topics reported include design of integral-shaped milling cutter profiles, a cooperative optimal method for two-level models of a micro device, design and numerical analysis of the internal suction flow heat sink, and a study on the rapid progressive die design of sheet metal with a free-form surface. Volume 2 collects papers on material science and technology, addressing areas such as tribological applications considering roughness effects on grain flow, design of forming dies for a manifold airbag inflator, the effects of microwave drying on dyeing rate of cotton yarn, and preparation of flexible graphite sheets with fine flake graphite. Volume 3 contains papers dealing with mechatronics and automation. Some subjects covered include a broaching-load testing system of a hydraulic broaching machine, adaptive impedance control for a robot based on estimation of environmental parameters, fault diagnosis of a hoist gearbox based on time-domain analysis of EMD and fuzzy clustering, and an open automatic laser engraving system.

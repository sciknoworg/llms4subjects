            "abstract": "The information infrastructure \u2013 comprising computers, embedded devices, networks and software systems \u2013 is vital to operations in every sector: chemicals, commercial facilities, communications, critical manufacturing, dams, defense industrial base, emergency services, energy, financial services, food and agriculture, government facilities, healthcare and public health, information technology, nuclear reactors, materials and waste, transportation systems, and water and wastewater systems. Global business and industry, governments, indeed society itself, cannot function if major components of the critical information infrastructure are degraded, disabled or destroyed. Critical Infrastructure Protection XVII describes original research results and innovative applications in the interdisciplinary field of critical infrastructure protection. Also, it highlights the importance of weaving science, technology and policy in crafting sophisticated, yet practical, solutions that will help secure information, computer and network assets in the various critical infrastructure sectors. Areas of coverage include: Themes and Issues Smart Grid Risks and Impacts Network and Telecommunications Systems Security Infrastructure Security Automobile Security This book is the seventeenth volume in the annual series produced by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group 11.10 on Critical Infrastructure Protection, an international community of scientists, engineers, practitioners and policy makers dedicated to advancing research, development and implementation efforts focused on infrastructure protection. The book contains a selection of eleven edited papers from the Seventeenth Annual IFIP WG 11.10 International Conference on Critical Infrastructure Protection, which was held at SRI International, Arlington, Virginia, USA in the spring of 2023. Critical Infrastructure Protection XVII is an important resource for researchers, faculty members and graduate students, as well as for as well as for policy makers, practitioners and other individuals with interests in homeland security.",

                "This volume presents select papers presented at the 7th International Conference on Recent Advances in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering and Soil Dynamics. The papers discuss advances in the fields of earthquake engineering connected with structures. Some of the themes include soil structure interaction, dynamic analysis, underground structures, vibration isolation, seismic response of buildings etc. A strong emphasis is placed on connecting academic research and field practice, with many examples, case studies, and best practices. This volume will be of interest to researchers and practicing engineers alike."

                "This book presents the select proceedings of the 1st International 13th National Conference on Industrial Problems on Machines and Mechanism (IPRoMM 2020) and examines issues in the design, manufacture, and performance of mechanical and mechatronic elements and systems that are employed in modern machines and devices. The topics covered include robotics, industrial CAD/CAM systems, mechatronics, machinery associated with conventional and unconventional manufacturing systems, material handling and automated assembly, mechanical and electro-mechanical systems of modern machinery and equipment, micro-devices, compliant mechanisms, hybrid electric vehicle and electric vehicle mechanisms, acoustic and noise control. This book also discusses the recent advances in the integration of IoT and Industry 4.0 in mechanism and machines. The book will be a valuable reference for academicians, researchers, and professionals interested in the design and development of industrial machines.",

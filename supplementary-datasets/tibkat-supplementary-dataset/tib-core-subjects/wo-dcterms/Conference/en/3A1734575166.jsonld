            "abstract": "This book includes papers collected for the 25th Symposium and Annual Meeting of the International Society for Ceramics in Medicine (BIOCERAMICS 25), held in Bucharest, Romania, from 7-10 November, 2013. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The papers were selected by reviewing the full papers of authors whose abstracts submitted to the Symposium were accepted after a blind peer-reviewing process, and reflected the most recent progress made in the study of bioceramics and their applications in medicine. The papers are focused not just on synthesis, processing and characterization of bioceramics, but also on surface modification, tissue engineering, nanomaterials and drug delivery. Which means that bioceramics are facing advanced towards the regeneration of the tissue by biomimetic design of structure and integration of biological function to optimize the tissue response. The strong contribution related to the application of bioceramics and composite materials in dentistry and orthopedics presented in this book confirm the importance of these materials for clinical practice in medical units.  The 73 selected papers cover bioceramics for the next 25 years; apatites; calcium phosphates; characterization and testing; synthesis and biomanufacturing; composite materials; scaffolds and tissue engineering; coatings, surface engineering, and biomimetic materials; clinical applications in dentistry; and clinical applications in orthopedics. Specific topics include a freeze-cast nanostructured apatite scaffold obtained from the low temperature biomineralization of reactive calcium phosphates, preparing and characterizing micro-nanostructured anatasefilm, fish scales as a biocomposite of collagen and calcium salts, new titanium alloys potentially used for metal-ceramic application in medicine, the  evaluation of new dental software for shade matching, and the radiographic analysis of bone remodeling around hydroxyapatite coated femoral stems",

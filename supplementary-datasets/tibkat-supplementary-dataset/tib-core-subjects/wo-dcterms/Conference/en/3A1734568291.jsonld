            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The goal of this collection of peer-reviewed papers was to provide researchers from the fields of Information Science, Automation and Materials Systems with a forum for sharing new ideas, innovations and solutions. The 371 peer-reviewed papers are grouped into the chapters: 1: Information Science and Automation, 2: Industry and Computer Applications, 3: Network Technology and Materials Engineering, 4: Intelligent Information and Applications, 5: Information Systems, Automation and Control, 6: Materials Engineering, Information and Automation, 7: Programming, Image and Industrial Application. Overall, the contents provide a useful handbook on the field.  This six-volume proceedings collects selected, peer-reviewed papers from a 2011 conference held in China, highlighting current research in the fields of information science, automation, and material systems. Most papers describe industrial applications, with applications in education also represented. The papers are grouped in sections on information science and automation, industry and computer applications, network technology and materials engineering, and intelligent information and applications, in addition to automation and control in information systems and materials engineering, and image and industry applications of programming. A sampling of the range of specific topics: anti-jamming and LPI radar with spread spectrum technology, a self-embedding watermark for image restoration based on repeat correcting code, a subgraph-based selective classifier ensemble algorithm, and a novel trajectory control algorithm for intersection-seam automated welding. Some other areas considered are tactics for developing modern agricultural logistics in central China, generating real-time responsive balance recovery animation, wireless sensor networks for search and rescue operations, a particle-on-grid method for incompressible fluids, and, surprisingly, the shear strength characteristics of municipal solid waste. Networked management of non-book materials, protecting video surveillance systems from lightening, algorithms for routing protocol in wireless sensor networks, and the application of data mining in constructivist learning are some of the other subjects reported. The set contains b&w photos and images, but no subject index",

                "Precision Livestock presents the latest scientific results from worldwide research, field studies and practical application. The book contains peer-reviewed papers that were presented at the 1st European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.The papers focus on physiological identification and monitoring of animals, on farm and in transit, and on the operation of automatic milking systems. Major objectives are secure methods of animal identification for traceability; animal welfare and hygiene. The economic and health effects of implementing precision livestock husbandry are featured in many of them.This first conference was held in parallel with the 4th European Conference on Precision Agriculture - the links between both technologies were drawn and the possible interactions between them were shown for the first time. The potential is to integrate both technologies to encompass the whole farm. Peer-reviewed papers from the Precision Agriculture conference are presented in a companion proceedings, Precision Agriculture",

            "abstract": "In recent years, micro- and nanotechnologies became key technologies, having a significant effect on the development of new products and production technologies, as well as on novel medical diagnosis and treatment methods. Moreover, due to their enormous potential for new applications, micro- and nanotechnologies, in future, will increasingly affect our every days life, with an impact, comparable to that of the industrial revolution in the 19th century, or the developments in microelectronics in the 20th century. In most cases, micro- and nanotechnology go hand in hand with each other: nanotechnology devices need an implementation into a microtechnology environment, working as a linkage to the macroscopic world, whereas microsystems benefit from functionality given by nanotechnology components. In the past, numerous conferences and workshops were held on either micro- or nanotechnology issues, individually, neglecting all aspects, related to the combination and integration of these two key technologies. The International Forum on MicroNano Integration therefore, addresses micro and nanotechnologies with a strong focus on synergy effects provided by combination of both technologies. It hence, will provide a forum for researchers of these two communities ? from industries as well as from research institutes - for contacting, exchange, and starting common research activities",

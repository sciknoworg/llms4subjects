            "abstract": "Gettering and Defect Engineering in Semiconductor Technology are discussed here,with particular emphasis being placed on device applications. Fundamental aspects,as well as technological problems which are associated with defects in electronic materials and devices, are addressed.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The topics in this volume were selected on the basis that single-crystal Si, and Si-based, semiconductors will dominate microelectronics until far into the 21st century. The main reason for the overwhelming success of silicon technology is economic: the production cost per area increases by a factor of 5, or even 10, on going from 200 mm Si wafers to compound semiconductors or other substrate materials. Furthermore, the unceasing efforts in research on Si-based materials have been able to overcome some of the most stringent limitations on a Si-based technology. In fact, demonstrations of the feasibility of integrating IV-IV heterostructures and light-emitting devices into silicon technology, together with the promise of 450mm wafers combined with 70 nm technology, seem set to maintain the performance advantages that cause more than 95% of all manufactured semiconductor devices to be fabricated in silicon. However, the demands for wider applications of solid-state electronics are increasing demands to be made for devices having higher performances or very special properties. This makes research, on advanced materials and devices which are based upon other semiconductors, a highly relevant strand of semiconductor research for the near future. These proceedings span a wide variety of topics: going from silicon crystal growth and substrates, to technological processes and analytical techniques, to dopant-defect interactions, gettering, Si opto-electronics, radiation-hardness and nanoelectronics. A small section is also dedicated to compound semiconductors and materials other than silicon",

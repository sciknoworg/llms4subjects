                "This book includes a collection of researches that contains research data, discussions and conclusions focusing on several related geotechnical aspects of infrastructure. Topics include issues related to civil infrastructure such as temperature-induced lateral earth pressure on bridge abutment, subsidence of high speed rail and expressway, application of recycled rubber mats, railway ballast evaluation, hurricane protection floodwall, tunnel portal stability, deep excavation case study and properties of contaminated soils. Various types of research were used in the various studies, including field measurements, numerical analyses and laboratory measurements. This findings and results should lead to more resilient infrastructure design, maintenance and management, which will provide benefits to both civil engineering practitioners, researchers and students."

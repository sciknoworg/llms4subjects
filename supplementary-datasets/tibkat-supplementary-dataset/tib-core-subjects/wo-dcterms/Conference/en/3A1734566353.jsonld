            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The search for new catalytic materials has grown into a very important multidisciplinary research field; including novel strategies for catalytic materials synthesis, control and manipulation of solid-state chemistry and surfaces, innovative characterization techniques and rapidly expanding catalysis applications, and has thus attracted the attention of large numbers of scientists and engineers all over the world. This special volume on Advanced Materials Research comprises new contributions covering aspects of catalyst preparation and characterization, as well as various applications of catalysis. Among these contributions are: the syntheses of novel catalytic materials involving surface functionalized mesoporous materials, hybrid inorganic-organic solids, oxide nanotubes and nanorods, carbon nanotubes and activated carbon, carbides and nitrides, zeolites, ion exchange resins, rare-earth oxide doped solid superacids and superbases and double-layer hydrotalcites, etc. Also discussed are the application of catalysis to various reactions, such as: hydrogen production and storage, NO reduction and photocatalytic degradation of VOCs, electrocatalytic synthesis of fine chemicals, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, petroleum hydrodesulfurization, isomerization and alkylation of alkanes, transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel, etc. Although the present volume does not cover all topics in the area of catalytic materials, it reflects recent advances and future expected trends in this field, and will undoubtedly benefit scientists and investigators from the academic world, as well as industrial engineers. The 30 selected papers include the plenary lecture on nanostructured materials for hydrogen storage and discussions in the areas of synthesizing and characterizing catalysts, environmental catalysis, catalysts for petroleum hydrotreating and refining, catalysts for fuel production, and electrocatalysis. Among specific topics are influences of surface chemistry on the dehydrogenation kinetics of ammonia borane in porous carbon scaffolds, the synthesis and photocatalytic performance of hierarchical porous titanium phosphonate hybrid materials, the catalytic activity of sulfated zirconia promoted with cerium oxide, basic ion exchange resins as heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel synthesis, and a novel non-metal oxygen reduction electrocatalyst based on platelet carbon nanofiber",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).The present publication arises as a result of the cooperation between the Institute of Production Systems and Applied Mechanics (IPSAM), belonging to the Faculty of Materials Sciences and Technology (MTF) of the Slovak University of Technology (STU) and TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS. The book is aimed at publishing scientific achievements on the Novel Trends in Production and Systems as well as at enhancing the worldwide cooperation and recognition among young and senior academicians and/or practitioners, and specially those of the central European region. This edition has been enriched taking into account years of research and teaching activities in the field, experiences resulting from the scientific collaboration among higher education centers, e.g.: CECOL 2012, while at the same time by also counting on prestigious and disciplined scientific and organizing committees respectively, who made a strong analysis of each one of the submitted papers. Some of the main topics included in the book are those related but not limited to Mechanical and Machine Designs, Machining Tools, Trends in Production Devices and Systems, Production Logistics, Flexible/Intelligent Manufacturing Systems and Cells, Robotics and Automation, Rapid Prototyping, Trends in Applied Mechanics and Materials, Maintenance, New Teaching and Research Approaches, among others. Keyword:Manufacturing Process Design, Optimization and Control; Manufacturing Automation; Manufacturing Process Simulations, Material Flow Analysis, Maintenance, Production Planning, Production Scheduling, New Teaching and Research Approaches, Intelligent Manufacturing Systems and Cells, Robotics, Rapid prototyping, Machining tools, Welding, Assembly Some of the papers look at management and teaching and at production systems and logistics, but most focus on novel trends in technology. The topics include applying material requirements planning as a method of enhancing production logistics in a company, the impact of customized variety on the configuration complexity of an assembly process, verifying shaped surface manufacturability and surface quality of a stamping die's punch, the dynamical effects of housing of the axial piston hydromotor, and the possibility of steering product surface layer properties in a burnishing rolling process. \u2014 Business administration\u2014 Logistics\u2014 Technology management",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Composites have long held the center-stage of research and development in the materials community. The concept of combining metals, ceramics and polymers \u2013 having various types, shapes and properties - into a single material exhibiting properties that none of its individual components possess, has created endless scope for the imagination of scientists and engineers. It has ignited numerous fields of research and development, and revolutionized many applications. However, in spite of the many advantages of composite materials, there remain troubling underlying problems arising from the complexity of the systems, and these have hindered their full exploitation in everyday life. Such challenges to the composite materials community have been the driving force for holding composite materials conferences such as the celebrated Cross-Strait ones. This collection comprises 45 peer-reviewed papers covering the latest progress in the research and development of composite materials; including metal-, ceramic- and polymer-based composites. The areas covered include the synthesis, processing, structure, properties and performance of composite materials. The editors (of the State Key Lab of Metal Matrix Composites, the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, and National Cheng Kung U., all in China) present 47 selected papers from the Fifth China Cross-strait Conference on Composite Materials, held in October of 2006. Generally speaking the papers explore the synthesis, processing, structure, properties, and performance of metal, ceramic, and polymer based composite materials. A few examples of specific topics include fabrication of ceramic-metal composites by melt infiltration of moso-bamboo-derived porous SiC, novel composite anode containing tin compounds and carbonaceous materials for Li-ion batteries, development and photoluminescence of ZnO-ZnS core-shell nanotube and nanorod arrays, and preparation and flame ablation/oxidation behavior of ZrB2/SiC ultra-high temperature ceramic composites",

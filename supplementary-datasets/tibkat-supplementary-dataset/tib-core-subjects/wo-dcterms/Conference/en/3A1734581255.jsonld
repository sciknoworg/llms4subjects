            "abstract": "Flexible and printed electronics are rather new fields in China. In particular, the term of \"printed electronics\" was almost unheard of in China five years ago when Professor Cui setup the first research center dedicated to the R&D of this technology. The collection includes selected peer reviewed papers form the 5th International Conference on Flexible and Printed Electronics (ICFPE) was successfully held in Beijing on 21-23 October 2014. The 39 papers share the newest ideas in the fields of followed: Synthesis and characterization of organic and inorganic electronics materials for printed electronics; Ink formulation of nanomaterials and applications in printed electronics; Solution-processing and/or printing of organic and inorganic thin film transistors, solar cells and light emitting devices; Organic and inorganic flexible electronic devices and displays; Flexible and plastic sensors and their applications; Processes, techniques and equipment for printed electronics; Design of flexible and printable electronic systems; Manufacturing of printed circuit (PCB) boards and RFID antennas; Packaging and encapsulation of OLED/OPV and printed electronic devices. Keyword: organic and inorganic electronics materials, nanomaterials, organic and inorganic thin film transistors, solar cells, Organic and inorganic flexible electonic displays, Flexible and plastic sensors From over 200 conference presentations and posters, 39 were selected for publication. They discuss such topics as modeling and optimizing industrial inkjet printheads for fabricating printable electronics, preparing conductive ink for organic solar cell electrodes, the monolithic integration of a flexible micro thermal flow sensor, preparing triangular silver nanoplates and their application in printed electronics, and the controlled fabrication of flexible multi-walled carbon nanotubes/reduced graphene oxide hybrid ultra-thin films. \u2014 Electronics\u2014 Materials science\u2014 Mechanical engineering",

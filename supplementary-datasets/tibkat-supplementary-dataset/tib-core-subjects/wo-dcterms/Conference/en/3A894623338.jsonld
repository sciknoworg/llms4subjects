            "abstract": "The 65 papers from the July 1999 symposium reflect two major shifts in the computer and communications industries: the Internet and wireless mobility. Regarding the Internet, there are research topics related to services and applications, such as services platforms, integrated services, billing, security, service management, and applications in education and other areas. At the information level, the focus is on multimedia information, its engineering and management, and its streaming in the infrastructure. The papers also present advances in network architecture, network management, protocol design, multicast communication, and quality-of-service issues. At the core of the wireless environment, there is a set of wireless and digital signal processing technologies addressing clarity, reliability, power, and coding. Technological issues related to a wireless environment are access and networking protocols, cellular network architecture, and user authentication. No subject index.

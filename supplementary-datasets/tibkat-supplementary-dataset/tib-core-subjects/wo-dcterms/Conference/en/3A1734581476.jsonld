            "abstract": "This topical volume on \"Recent Developments of Diffusion Processes and their Applications: Fluid, Heat and Mass\" addresses diffusion in a wider sense with a special focus on technical applications. Diffusion phenomena play an important role in the development of modern engineering materials and related fields. Understanding these different transport phenomena at many levels, from atomistic to macro, has therefore long attracted the attention of many researchers in materials science and engineering and related disciplines. The present topical volume captures a representative cross-section of some of the recent advances in the area of diffusive transport. Reflecting the enormous breadth of the area, the range of topics covered is accordingly very large. Topics include classical mass diffusion problems such as phase transformations, corrosion behavior, thin layers and microstructures. Technical applications related to fuel production and energy conversion, biological and biomedical material are treated. Many of these topics are related to experimental measurements and methods as well as simulation and approaches to predict properties and processes. Keyword: materials science, Diffusion processes Reviewing recent developments in diffusive transport, engineers in various specialties consider classical mass diffusion problems such as phase transformation, corrosion behavior, thin layers, and microstructures; technical applications related to fuel production and energy conversion and biological and biomedical materials; and experimental measurements and methods, simulation, and approaches to predicting properties and processes. Among the topics are heat and mass transfer and energy aspects in combined infrared-convective drying of bee pollen, the interpretation of a marker experiment conducted during the formation of a higher oxide on the surface of a lower oxide, morphological evolution in hetero-epitaxial thin film structures at the nanoscale, effects of mechanical alloying on the structure and properties of iron powders, and the direct numerical simulation of the pressure drop through structured porous media. \u2014 Materials science\u2014 Physics\u2014 Thermodynamics",

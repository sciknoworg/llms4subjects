                "This book brings together a selection of best papers from The International Conference on Water and Flood Management, Bangladesh, 2021. The book chapters are based on contributions from multidisciplinary fields, such as nature-based solutions, hydro-meteorological forecasting, river restoration, coastal risk, episodic natural hazards, water risk and resilience, climate-resilient infrastructure, blue economy, and water management during the COVID-19 pandemic. With changing physical and socioeconomic risks due to changes in climate and anthropogenic interventions, integrated approaches to analyzing these processes and their interactions, along with integrating nature-based solutions, are gaining traction. With this special focus on science, policy, and practice to ensure sustainability in the water sector, the conference provided a platform for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to exchange their knowledge and experience."

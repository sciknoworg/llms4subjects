                "This book presents the proceedings of the 39th annual Midwest Biopharmaceutical Statistics Workshop (MBSW), held in Muncie, Indiana on May 16\u201318, 2016. It consists of selected peer- reviewed and revised papers on topics ranging from statistical applications in drug discovery and CMC to biomarkers, clinical trials, and statistical programming. All contributions feature original research, and together they cover the full spectrum of pharmaceutical R&D \u2013 with a special focus on emergent topics such as biosimilarity, bioequivalence, clinical trial design, and subgroup identification. Founded in 1978, the MBSW has provided a forum for statisticians to share knowledge, research, and applications on key statistical topics in pharmaceutical R&D for almost forty years, with the 2016 conference theme being \u201cThe Power and 3 I\u2019s of Statistics: Innovation, Impact and Integrity.\u201d The papers gathered here will be of interest to all researchers whose work involves the quantitative aspects of pharmaceutical research and development, including pharmaceutical statisticians who want to keep up-to-date with the latest trends, as well as academic statistics researchers looking for areas of application",

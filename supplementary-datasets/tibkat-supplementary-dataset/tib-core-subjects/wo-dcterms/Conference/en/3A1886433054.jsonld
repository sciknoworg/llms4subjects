                "This book discusses automated computing systems which are mostly powered by intelligent technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, image recognition, speech processing, cloud computing, etc., to perform complex automated tasks which are not possible by traditional computing systems. The chapters are extended version of research works presented at second PhD Research Symposium in various advanced technologies used in the field of computer science. This book provides an opportunity for the researchers to get ideas regarding the ongoing works that help them in formulating problems of their interest. The academicians can also be benefited to know about the current research trends that smooth the way to guide their students to carry out research work in the proper direction. The industry people will be also facilitated to know about the current advances in research work and materialize the research work into industrial applications."

                "This book comprises selected papers on advances in the field of health and environment safety that were presented at the International Conference on Advances in the field of Health, Safety, Fire, Environment, Allied sciences and engineering (HSFEA 2020). This book presents a number of research papers which focuses on basic concept of sustainable development and its role in modern world for clean development technology. The book also presents methods that can be used to effectively monitor and measure climate change and global warming. Further, the contents of this work stress the importance of maintaining safety and healthy work environments that are free of occupational health hazards. This book will be of interest to researchers, professionals, and policy makers alike",

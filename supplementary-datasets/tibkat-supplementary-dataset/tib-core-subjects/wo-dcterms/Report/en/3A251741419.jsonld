            "abstract": "Rez.: Time series studies are main topics in the international Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) programme. One major goal of JGOFS is to determine and understand the impact of processes in the upper layer of the oceans on the vertical flux of chemical constituents, its saisonality, regional gradients and depth variabilities. From 1992 to 1997 mooring systems were developed at three positions in the North Atlantic (33\u00b0N/21\u00b0W, 47\u00b0N/20\u00b0W, 53\u00b0N/21\u00b0W) containing time-series sediment traps and equipment to measure physical data. the seasonally resolved fluxes of particulate trace elements (TP K. Kremling) and of trace organic compounds (TP J.C. Duinker & E.E. Schulz-Bull) have been measured in different depths of the deep Atlantic Ocean. The investigations were carried out in close cooperation with the biological project (TP B. Zeitzschel). Another important objective was to study the suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the water column. The surface sampling was carried out by means of the Kiel pumping system (~10m depth). For deep water SPM sampling the \"Kiel in situ pumping system\" was used down to 4150 m. Some results of the investigations are summarized in the following: Significant variabilities of fluxes with season and depth (1000 m to maximum of 4000 m) were observed for \"biogenic elements\" only. On the other hand, we found a distinct large-scale increase of actual fluxes into the deep-sea traps to the south for Al, Co, Fe, Mn and V. Some constituents of organic carbon are more labile, e.g., amino acids. These compounds exhibit a declining ratio to POC with depth. The distribution pattern of anthropogenic chlorinated biphenyls (CB's) changes with depth by fractionation during solution and adsorption processes. It has been observed that with increasing depth during plankton blooms (coccolithophores) in organic matter as distinct alkenone ratio.",

            "abstract": "This report investigates the situation of women scientists in the Enwise (Enlarge Women In Science to East) countries, providing an insight into the situation from a historical, as well as a contemporary perspective. It puts the women and science issue into a new perspective, that of a wider Europe. The gender equality issue is a complex one. This report helps to understand how it has been shaped in the Enwise countries. It shows that while formal legislation is an absolutely necessary condition, it is not sufficient to guarantee equality. The report also calls for changes in mentalities and in working conditions. Contents: 1. From national icons to superwomen. Gender and social change from pre-communism to post-communism. - 2. Funding without freedom, freedom without funding. Higher Education and Research and Development sectors in the Enwise countries. - 3. The bees and the honey. Women in science in the Enwise countries. - 4. How far is the target? Measuring the participation of women scientists from the Enwise countries in the Research Framework Programmes. - 5. Fostering the talents and knowledge of women scientists from the Enwise countries. Recommendations. - Epilogue: Abundance or shortage? Gender and scientific excellence in the Enwise countries. - Annexes. - Abbreviations. - Enwise Expert Group (members) (HoF/text adopted)",

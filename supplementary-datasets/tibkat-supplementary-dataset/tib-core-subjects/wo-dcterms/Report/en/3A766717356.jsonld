            "title": "Minimal degree of the difference of two polynomials over Q, and weighted plane trees",
            "abstract": "A weighted bicolored plane tree (or just tree for short) is a bicolored plane tree whose edges are endowed with a positive integral weights. The degree of a vertex is defined as the sum of the weights of the edges incident to this vertex. In ordinary plane trees the weights of all edges are equal to 1. A weighted plane tree is a graphical representation of a pair of coprime polynomials P;Q 2 C[x] of the same degree (defined uniquely up to an affine transformations of the source and target variables) such that: (a) the multiplicities of the roots of P (respectively, of Q) are equal to the degrees of the black (respectively, white) vertices of the corresponding tree; (b) the degree of the difference R = P .. Q attains the minimum, possible for the given multiplicities of the roots of P and Q. In fact, the degree of P and Q is equal to the total weight of the tree in question while the degree of R is equal to its \\overweight\", meaning its total weight minus the number of edges. If, furthermore, such a tree is uniquely determined by the set of its black-and-white vertex degrees (we call such trees unitrees), then the corresponding polynomials are defined over Q. he search for the triples (P; Q;R) such that deg R = min, besides being an interesting problem in its own sake, is also related to some important questions in number theory. Dozens of number-theoretic papers, from 1965 [4] to 2010 [3], were dedicated to the study of these polynomials. Since the main interest of number-theorists lies in Diophantine equations, the most interesting triples (P; Q;R) are those defined over Q. In this paper we give a complete classification of the unitrees.",

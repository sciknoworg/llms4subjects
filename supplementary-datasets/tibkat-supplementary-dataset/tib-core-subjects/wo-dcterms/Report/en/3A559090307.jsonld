            "abstract": "Berlin as a city state is both local authority and federal state of the Federal Republic, as well as a location of many renowned institutions of research and culture. In close cooperation of the institutions of research with the IT service centre Berlin (ITDZ, the former Landesbetrieb f\u00fcr Informationstechnik) - which is the appropriate facility for the authorities of Berlin - a glass fibre network of a total extension of 856 kilome-tres of fibre optics (144 fibres each cable optic) for the common use of research and administration has been established and advanced since 1993. In 1994, when a resolution of the Senate of Berlin laid down the use of the appropriate fibre networks by the research facilities, this was the official beginning of the Berlin Research Area Information Network (BRAIN). The first seven interfaces in this fibre network in ATM technology (Classical BRAIN-ATM) were already established by the research facilities in 1995. In 1999, first systems run in Ethernet technology (Classical BRAIN-GE). These heterogeneous networks with different interfaces have been supported locally by the network administrators of the research facilities following global agreements. Management and advancement of the overall networks were encumbered by these local administrations. Based on the existing experience, Berlins research facilities agreed on the building and advancement of a technically new integrated network in gigabit Ethernet technology with standardised facilities and a centrally managed network ...",

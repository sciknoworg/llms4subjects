            "title": "Cryptography without one-way functions",
            "abstract": "We show that some problems in cryptography can be solved without using one-way functions. The latter are usually regarded as a central concept of cryptography, but the very existence of one-way functions depends on difficult conjectures in complexity theory, most notably on the notorious P 6= NP\u02ba conjecture. This is why cryptographic primitives that do not employ one-way functions are often called unconditionally secure\u02ba. In this paper, we suggest protocols for secure computation of the sum, product, and some other functions of two or more elements of an arbitrary constructible ring, without using any one-way functions. A new input that we offer here is that, in contrast with other proposals, we conceal intermediate results\u02ba of a computation. For example, when we compute the sum of k numbers, only the final result is known to (one of) the parties; partial sums are not known to anybody. Other applications of our method include voting/rating over insecure channels and a rather elegant and efficient solution of the two millionaires problem\u02ba. While it is fairly obvious that a secure (bit) commitment between two parties is impossible without a one-way function, we show that it is possible if the number of parties is at least 3. Then we show how our unconditionally secure (bit) commitment scheme for 3 parties can be used to arrange an unconditionally secure (bit) commitment between just two parties if they use a dummy\u02ba (e.g., a computer) as the third party. We explain how our concept of a dummy\u02ba is different from a wellknown concept of a trusted third party\u02ba. Based on a similar idea, we also offer an unconditionally secure k-n oblivious transfer protocol between two parties who use a dummy\u02ba. We also suggest a protocol, without using a one-way function, for the so-called mental poker\u02ba, i.e., a fair card dealing (and playing) over distance. Computational cost of our protocols is negligible to the point that all of them can be easily executed without a computer. Finally, we propose a secret sharing scheme where an advantage over Shamir&rsquo;s and other known secret sharing schemes is that nobody, including the dealer, endsup knowing the shares (of the secret) owned by any particular player",

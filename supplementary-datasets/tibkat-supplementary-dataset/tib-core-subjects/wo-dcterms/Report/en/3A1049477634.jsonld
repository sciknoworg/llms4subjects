            "abstract": "This country report is part of the \u201cImplementation of Nationally Determined Contributions\u201d (NDCs) project (FKZ 3716 4111 80), which considers NDC implementation in 10 countries: Colombia, Ethio-pia, Georgia, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Marshall Islands, Morocco, Peru, and Viet Nam. This project places a special emphasis on identifying potential barriers to NDC implementation and mitigation potentials which could go beyond the current NDCs. The country reports analyze the NDCs in terms of their robustness and coherence with other national or sectoral plans and targets, and put them into the context of additional mitigation potentials and other national circumstances. For countries where coal plays a critical role in consumption or national production, the analysis covers further details on this sector, including the economic relevance and lo-cal impacts of coal production or consumption. The content is based on available literature from re-search and public sector information on policies and institutions. To be able to analyze the content in more detail, the authors focus the research on a number of rele-vant fields of action. The fields of action were selected based on historic and projected sectoral emis-sions development, comprehensive literature on GHG mitigation potentials, identified barriers and emissions reductions as well as feasibility, costs, and co-benefits.The project was suggested and is financed by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Con-servation, Building and Nuclear Safety, supervised by the German Environment Agency and carried out by independent think tanks - NewClimate Institute and Wuppertal Institute.  The studies are a continu-ation of similar previous efforts (project numbers 3713 41 102, 3711 41 120, 360 16 022, 364 01 003 and 363 01 128) and aim to inform policy makers and the interested public about the implementation of NDCs in individual countries. The choice of countries is based on developing countries with which Germany works closely on climate change topics.The papers are scientific in nature, and all suggestions are derived by the authors from careful analy-sis, having in mind the individual backgrounds of countries. They aim to increase knowledge about im-plementation of mitigation potentials to meet the globally agreed goal of staying within a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C or well below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, without intending to prescribe specific policies.",

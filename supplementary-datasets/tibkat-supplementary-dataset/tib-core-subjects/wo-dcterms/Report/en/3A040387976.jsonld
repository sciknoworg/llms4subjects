            "abstract": "\"This report presents data for 33 occupied houses and buildings with solarassisted spaceheating systems, all extensively monitored and distributed throughout Europe. The report describes the projects, presents the measurements and discusses the performance, as well as the technical problems which have been experienced. The measurements show that the majority have performed less well than expected and were expensive in relation to their performance. However the study also indicates that significantly higher energy yields can be obtained, and shows possible ways of achieving them. It is clear that more attention should be paid to maximising the solar heat contribution per unit collector area or per unit of investment, and this report is intended to contribute to the development of an improved second generation of optimised solar heating systems, which promise higher energy yields and reliability with improved cost effectiveness. The main conclusions and recommendations on reporting formats, active space heating, and passive space heating are presented.\" - (Euro-abstracts, Section 1, Vol. 22, No 3, 1984)",

            "abstract": "\"The work reported here forms part of the EEC FAST programme. It examines the R & D and employment implications of emerging trends within the 'environmental industry'. A considerable amount of the research effort has been devoted to defining the nature, size and structure of the industry and employment within it and its future prospects. Clearly these are strongly conditioning the development of environmental policy and legislation, as well as key technological changes, both in product and process, of those activities which produce pollution. The last chapters review current pollution control technologies and the changing trends in the environmental industry, with an overview of current and emerging environmental problems and technological responses to them. They identify R & D 'gaps', and indicate the key areas for research and development that emerge as relevant for action at the level of the European Community.\" - (Euro-abstracts, Section 1, Vol. 22, No 9, 1984)",

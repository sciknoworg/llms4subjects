            "abstract": "We investigate the impact of link and path restoration on the cost of telecommunication networks. The surprising result is the following: the cost of an optimal network configuration is almost independent of the restoration concept if (i) the installation of network elements (ADMs, DXCs, or routers) and interface cards, (ii) link capacities, and (iii) working and restoration routings are simultaneously optimized. We present a mixed-integer programming model which integrates all these decisions. Using a branch-and-cut algorithm (with column generation to deal with all potential routing paths), we solve structurally different real-world problem instances and show that the cost of optimal solutions is almost independent of the used restoration concept. In addition, we optimize spare capacities for given shortest working paths which are predetermined with respect to different link metrics. In comparison to simultaneous optimization of working and restoration routings, it turns out that this approach does not allow to obtain predictably good results.",

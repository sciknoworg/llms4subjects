            "abstract": "\"The subject of this report is the biomethanization installation situated on a small poultry farm near Marche (Belgium). It consists of a plug flow digester made from a semi-interred, flexible plastic cylinder with a volume of 40 cubic metres. The poultry manure occupies the lower half of the cylinder and the biogas produced by anaerobic biological digestion is stored in the upper part. The gas is drawn from the cylinder at the correct pressure to feed various gas appliances on the farm and to fire the small boiler which heats the digester. The report describes the performance of this installation over a period of 20 months, during which the digester produced approximately 230 gigajoules in the form of biogas. The global energy yield of the installation is greater than 60%. If we deduct from the overall cost of the project those amounts connected with the prototype character of the installation, break-even point can be achieved for this type of small digester, which is not only a significant source of energy, but also has the advantage of producing a deodorized organic fertilizer.\" - (Euro-abstracts, Section 1, Vol. 22, No 1/2, 1984)",

            "title": "Reconciling theory and practice : a revised pole equation for W-CDMA cell powers",
            "abstract": "The performance evaluation of W-CDMA networks is intricate as cells are strongly coupled through interference. Pole equations have been developed as a simple tool to analyze cell capacity. Numerous scientific contributions have been made on their basis. In the established forms, the pole equations rely on strong assumptions such as homogeneous traffic, uniform users, and constant downlink orthogonality factor. These assumptions are not met in realistic scenarios. Hence, the pole equations are typically used during initial network dimensioning only. Actual network (fine-) planning requires a more faithful analysis of each individual cells capacity. Complex analytical analysis or Monte-Carlo simulations are used for this purposes. In this paper, we generalize the pole equations to include inhomogeneous data. We show how the equations can be parametrized in a cell-specific way provided the transmit powers are known. This allows to carry over prior results to realistic settings. This is illustrated with an example: Based on the pole equation, we investigate the accuracy of ``average snapshot approximations for downlink transmit powers used in state-of-the-art network optimization schemes. We confirm that the analytical insights apply to practice-relevant settings on the basis of results from detailed Monte-Carlo simulation on realistic datasets.",

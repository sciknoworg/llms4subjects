            "abstract": "New evolutionary supersymmetric systems whose right-hand sides are homogeneous differential polynomials and which possess infinitely many higher symmetries are constructed. Their intrinsic geometry (symmetries, conservation laws, recursion operators, Hamiltonian structures, and exact solutions) is analyzed by using algebraic methods. A supersymmetric  representation of the Burgers equation is obtained. An  KdV-component system that reduces to the Burgers equation in the diagonal  case  is found; the  Burgers equation admits and  modified KdV symmetry. A one-parametric family of  super-systems that exte nd the Burgers equation is described; we relate the systems within this family with the Burgers equation on associative algebras. A supersymmetric bosonfermion representation of the dispersionless Boussinesq equation is investigated. We solve this equation explicitly and construct its integrable deformation that generates two infinite sequences of the Hamiltonians. The Boussinesq equation with dispersion is embedded in a one-parametric family of two-component systems with dissipation. We finally construct a three-parametric supersymmetric system that incorporates the Boussinesq equation with dispersion and dissipation but never retracts to it for any values of the parameters.",

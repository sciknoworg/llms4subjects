            "abstract": "844 million people do not have access to clean water. As water shortages affect all aspects of life, drinking water scarcity is becoming one of the most pressing global problems, especially in remote areas. Ninety-six percent of the world's water is within the oceans, which, due to their excessive salinity, cannot be used for drinking water. The most commonly used technologies for seawater desalination are membrane processes and thermal processes. Among all current desalination technologies, reverse osmosis (RO) is the most reliable and simplest method. In the reverse osmosis process, high pressure is generated to push water against the osmotic pressure from the contaminated side of the membrane to the clean water side. A significant amount of energy is required to achieve such high pressures. Although fossil fuels are the most commonly used energy source for desalination plants, less than 15% of people in developing and sub-Saharan countries have access to these energy sources. Solar energy offers a promising alternative and would also be a widely available renewable energy resource [1] [2]. However, the large fluctuations in solar output, are a major challenge for photovoltaic-powered reverse osmosis (PVRO) systems. Therefore, the conventional systems currently available on the market require electricity storage (batteries) to compensate for these fluctuations and provide a constant situation for the operation of the system. However, batteries are very expensive and have a limited lifetime (3-5 years) [3], which is further reduced in hot and humid areas. The need for a replaceable battery increases production and maintenance costs for potable water. In addition to the above costs, the use of batteries requires several energy conversions steps. These conversions increase the complexity of the system and result in energy losses at each step, decreasing the efficiency of the overall RO process. In the Grino system, the battery unit is replaced by an innovative variable frequency generator (VFG) (patent pending). Standard RO units typically operate under constant conditions. Since the output power of photovoltaic (PV) modules varies between 0 and 1300 W/m\u00b2 throughout the day depending on the position of the sun, a conventional RO system pump can only operate at constant rated power for a limited period of time using a photovoltaic supply. Compared to the systems available on the market, the Grino system is said to be fully adaptable to the available solar power. For this purpose, Grino Water Solutions GmbH developed the power management unit (Fig. 1 and 2). This is intended to compensate for fluctuations in solar energy by regulating the speed of the pump and the pressure on the membranes.",

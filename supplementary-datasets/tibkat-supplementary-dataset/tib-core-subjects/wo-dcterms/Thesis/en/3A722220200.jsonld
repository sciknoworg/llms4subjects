            "abstract": "In this thesis, mechanisms for the onset of obesity were investigated. Expression studies were performed to analyse the obesity related factor DORin an animal model and a possible effect of translational control in early adipogenesis was proofed in a cell model.Differences in DOR expression were measured in diverse types of adipose and muscle tissue by qPCR. To test short term influences on DOR expression by nutritional factors, mice were fed different fat rich diets with 18% or 80% fat content for one week. Afterwards, DOR expression was compared to normal fed animals. Additionally, changes in DOR expression was investigated in genetically obese mice compared to control animals. For this, tissues derived from young (45 days old) and adult (100 days old) animals. Changes in DOR expression of mice fed a fat rich diet were influenced by the dietary fat content, the type of investigated tissue and sex of the animals. For genetically obese mice there was also a significant influence of sex on DOR expression observed. But no significant differences in DOR expression were detected between young and older mice. DOR might be part of a defence mechanism against fat storage in high fat diets or obesity ...",

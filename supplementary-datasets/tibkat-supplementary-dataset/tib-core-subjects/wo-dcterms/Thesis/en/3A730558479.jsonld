            "abstract": "The world population is growing, resulting in an increasing demand for food and energy plants. During the last decades the modification of landscapes into agricultural production units and the intensification of agricultural practises have led to a decline in biodiversity. Biodiversity is crucial for the stability of ecosystem services driven by biotic interactions, such as pollination and biological control. Pollination is important for reproduction of wild plants and it is estimated that 75 % of the world crops need animal pollination for obtaining optimal yields. In the northern hemisphere bees are the most important pollinators in the agricultural landscape. But there is evidence that we are facing a pollinator crisis since managed honey bees as well as wild bee populations are declining, especially in intensively managed areas. Agricultural intensification affects also predatory wasps, which are contributing to biological control of pest species. Parasitoids play an important role in regulating host species. Biodiversity loss of functionally important groups such as pollinators, predators and parasitoids can destabilize trophic interactions leading to cascading extinctions. The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of different landscape elements and habitat types, which are common in the agricultural landscape, on the communities of bees, wasps and their parasitoids with changing importance of habitat type along a gradient of landscape complexity. The study was carried out in the vicinity of the city of G\u00f6ttingen, Lower Saxony, Germany ...",

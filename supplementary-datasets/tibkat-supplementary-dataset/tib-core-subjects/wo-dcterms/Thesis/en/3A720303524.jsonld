            "abstract": "Macromolecular assemblies often undergo substantial structural rearrangements. Not only do functional states differ from each other, a single functional state also exhibits inherent conformational heterogeneity. A typical example is the yeast spliceosomal B-complex before and after catalytic activation by Prp2. Electron microscopy datasets of both states were compared and it could be verified that the complex undergoes a significant structural remodelling upon activation. Conformational heterogeneity limits the resolution of the 3D electron microscopy reconstruction or necessitates the solution of several distinct substructures  an often time consuming process that also requires large datasets. For many cases, reduction of conformational freedom within the sample would be advantageous: More structural information could be gained from a smaller dataset.The GraFix preparation protocol significantly improves the sample quality of macromolecules by stabilizing the sample chemically with glutaraldehyde, a crosslinking reagent, in a density gradient. Both chemical and physical modifications of the protocol were tested. Several compounds were added to the gradient and their effects on heterogeneity were evaluated on the 2D-level. However, the modifications did not lead to a definitive improvement in sample quality. Efforts were refocused on the temperature at which the sample is exposed to the crosslinking reagent ...",

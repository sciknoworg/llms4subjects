            "abstract": "Syrian agriculture faces new opportunities in a liberalized trading world. The European Union has been one of the most important new markets for the Syrian citrus output but trading among the neighbors has to expand in the future, specially, with the countries of (GAFTA) region and eastern Europa. This research identifies the export opportunities for Syrian citrus growers to the EU from the perspective of supply chain and answers the question of how the Syrian citrus sector to become more competitive and gain market share in the EU countries as the low cost of citrus production in Syria nowadays is not a strong reason although it helps. It also considers that the competition in the EU markets is the most determinant obstacle for the development of Syrian citrus exports through applying protectionist policies. The main findings of this research was based on a detailed study for the comparative advantages of Syrian citrus sector in addition to a general analysis for citrus supply chain in Syrian and European markets.",

            "title": "Natural Urban Resilience: Understanding general urban resilience through Addis Ababa\u2019s inner city",
            "abstract": "This dissertation describes the urban actors and spatial practices that contribute to natural urban resilience in Addis Ababa\u2019s inner city. Natural urban resilience is a non-strategical and bottom-up, everyday form of general urban resilience \u2013 an urban system\u2019s ability to maintain its essential characteristics under any change. This study gains significance by exposing conceptual gaps in the current un-derstanding of general urban resilience and highlighting its unconvincing applicability to African cities. This study attains further relevance by highlighting the danger of the ongoing large-scale redevelopment of the inner city. The inner city has naturally formed, and its urban memory, spaces, and social cohesion contribute to its primarily low-income population\u2019s resilience. This thesis argues that the inner city\u2019s demolition poses an incalculable risk of maladaptation to future stresses and shocks for Addis Ababa. The city needs a balanced urban discourse that highlights the inner city\u2019s qualities and suggests feasible urban transformation measures. \u201cNatural Urban Resilience\u201d contributes an empirical study to the debate by identifying those aspects of the inner city that contribute to general resilience and identifies feasible action areas. This study develops a qualitative research design for a single case study in Addis Ababa. The data is obtained through expert interviews, interviews with resi-dents, and the analysis of street scene photos, which are abstracted using Grounded Theory. That way, this thesis provides first-time knowledge about who and what generates urban resilience in the inner city of Addis Ababa and how. Furthermore, the study complements existing theories on general urban resilience. It provides a detailed understanding of the change mechanisms in resilience, of which it identifies four: adaptation, upgrading, mitigation, and resistance. It also adapts the adaptive cycle, a widely used concept in resilience thinking, conceptually for urban environments. The study concludes that the inner city\u2019s continued redevelopment poses an incalculable threat to the entire city. Therefore, \u201cNatural urban resilience\u201d recommends carefully weighing any intervention in the inner city to promote Addis Ababa\u2019s overall resilience. This dissertation proposes a pattern language for natural urban resilience to support these efforts and to translate the model of natural urban resilience into practice.",

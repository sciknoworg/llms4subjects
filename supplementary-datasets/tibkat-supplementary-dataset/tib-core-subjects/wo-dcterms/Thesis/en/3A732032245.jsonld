            "abstract": "Leaf senescence is an active process required for plant survival, and it is flexibly controlled, allowing plant adaptation to environmental conditions. Although senescence is largely an age-dependent process, it can be triggered by environmental signals and stresses. Leaf senescence coordinates the breakdown and turnover of many cellular components, allowing a massive remobilization and recycling of nutrients from senescing tissues to other organs (e.g., young leaves, roots, and seeds), thus enhancing the fitness of the plant. Such metabolic coordination requires a tight regulation of gene expression. One important mechanism for the regulation of gene expression is at the transcriptional level via transcription factors (TFs). The NAC TF family (NAM, ATAF, CUC) includes various members that show elevated expression during senescence, including ORE1 (ANAC092/AtNAC2) among others. ORE1 was first reported in a screen for mutants with delayed senescence (oresara1, 2, 3, and 11). It was named after the Korean word \u201coresara,\u201d meaning \u201clong-living,\u201d and abbreviated to ORE1, 2, 3, and 11, respectively. Although the pivotal role of ORE1 in controlling leaf senescence has recently been demonstrated, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the pathways it regulates are still poorly understood. To unravel the signaling cascade through which ORE1 exerts its function, we analyzed particular features of regulatory pathways up-stream and down-stream of ORE1. We identified characteristic spatial and temporal expression patterns of ORE1 that are conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum and that link ORE1 expression to senescence as well as to salt stress. We proved that ORE1 positively regulates natural and dark-induced senescence. Molecular characterization of the ORE1 promoter in silico and experimentally suggested a role of the 5\u2019UTR in mediating ORE1 expression. ORE1 is a putative substrate of a calcium-dependent protein kinase named CKOR (unpublished data). Promising data revealed a positive regulation of putative ORE1 targets by CKOR, suggesting the phosphorylation of ORE1 as a requirement for its regulation. Additionally, as part of the ORE1 up-stream regulatory pathway, we identified the NAC TF ATAF1 which was able to transactivate the ORE1 promoter in vivo. Expression studies using chemically inducible ORE1 overexpression lines and transactivation assays employing leaf mesophyll cell protoplasts provided information on target genes whose expression was rapidly induced upon ORE1 induction. First, a set of target genes was established and referred to as early responding in the ORE1 regulatory network. The consensus binding site (BS) of ORE1 was characterized. Analysis of some putative targets revealed the presence of ORE1 BSs in their promoters and the in vitro and in vivo binding of ORE1 to their promoters. Among these putative target genes, BIFUNCTIONAL NUCLEASE I (BFN1) and VND-Interacting2 (VNI2) were further characterized. The expression of BFN1 was found to be dependent on the presence of ORE1. Our results provide convincing data which support a role for BFN1 as a direct target of ORE1. Characterization of VNI2 in age-dependent and stress-induced senescence revealed ORE1 as a key up-stream regulator since it can bind and activate VNI2 expression in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, VNI2 was able to promote or delay senescence depending on the presence of an activation domain located in its C-terminal region. The plasticity of this gene might include alternative splicing (AS) to regulate its function in different organs and at different developmental stages, particularly during senescence. A model is proposed on the molecular mechanism governing the dual role of VNI2 during senescence.",

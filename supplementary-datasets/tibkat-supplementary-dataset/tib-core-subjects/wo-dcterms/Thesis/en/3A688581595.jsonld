            "abstract": "The understanding of the material properties, the organization and the assembly of the cytoskeleton remains challenging. In this thesis the viscoelastic properties of cytoskeletal networks were investigated using microrheology. An optical trapping based microrheology setup has been constructed, which is more compact and less sensitive to noise, while allowing sampling with higher bandwidth compared to existing setups. Passive and active one- and two-particle microrheology can be performed using two independent optical traps with different wavelengths, which are steerable with high precision using acousto- as well as electro-optical deflection. The custom-built microscope includes DIC and fluorescence illumination and high-precision three-dimensional positioning of the sample is achieved by a piezoelectric stage. The alignment, drift and noise performance of the setup has been tested in a simple viscous fluid and in living cells. High-bandwidth microrheological measurements in a variety of model systems were performed. Simple microtubule networks were investigated, as well as a nonequilibrium system of microtubules together with motor proteins. A composite network consisting of microtubules and F-actin with and without cross-linkers is described and its viscoelastic properties were measured over a wide range of frequencies. Furthermore, a nonequilibrium system involving microtubules and F-actin as well as microtubule-associated motor proteins has been characterized ...",

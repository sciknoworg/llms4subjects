            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: Rationale:The Default Mode Network (DMN) as the most prominent resting state network of the brain has been associated with internally oriented thinking (e.g. thinking about the past, i.e. autobiographical memory (AM)). An aberrant organization and activity of this network has been discussed to underlie rumination in depression via an increased internal orientation due to reduced capacities to down-regulate network's activity. The prevalence of AM disturbances and depressive symptoms is significantly increased in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients when compared to patients with other focal epilepsies and general population. Depression in TLE is largely assumed to be evoked by disease-related disturbances of brain networks. Since, the DMN has been found to be altered at a global and at a nodal level in TLE patients, the issue under investigation is to clarify to what extent network properties of the DMN might be able to account for cognitive and psychological symptoms frequently observed in TLE patients and to what extent AM disturbances and depressive symptoms might have common underlying correlates within the DMN, and how they are related to seizure freedom. For this purpose, three studies were conducted:In Study 1, associations of seizure freedom and DMN properties in TLE patients were investigated. In Study 2, it was assessed how DMN properties associated with seizure freedom are related to AM performance in these patients. In a third study, it was examined how DMN properties associated with seizure freedom and AM performance are connected to the prevalence of depressive symptoms in TLE patients. A graphtheoretical approach based upon resting state - functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data was used to investigate these questions.Methods:27 TLE patients were recruited from the Epilepsy Center of the Freiburg University Hospital. Twelve of them had been seizure free for at least one year of duration, 15 patients had ongoing active TLE. In addition, 15 healthy volunteers participated in the study. AM was assessed using the autobiographical part C of the Inventar fuer Gedaechtnisdiagnostik (IGD). Depressive symptoms were assessed using Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). An eight minute rs-fMRI was conducted using the following parameters: TR = 1750 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 70\u00b0, 3 x 3 x 5 m3 voxel size, 28 oblique axial slices. DMN was extracted using 13 predefined regions of interest (ROI). A graphtheoretical approac ...",

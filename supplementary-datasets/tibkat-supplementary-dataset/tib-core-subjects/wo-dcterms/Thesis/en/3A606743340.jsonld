            "abstract": "The HIV-1 Nef protein belongs to the so-called accessory proteins and is critical for optimal viral replication and the pathogenesis of AIDS. It is supposed that the functions of Nef require its membrane association. For many years it was thought, that this targeting is mediated by an N-terminal myristoylation site. But recent studies showed that also a non-myristoylated mutant can stably bind to cellular membranes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the N-terminal basic residues also play an important role in the association of Nef with cellular membranes via electrostatic interactions with the head groups of lipids. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the membrane anchor and the impact of the basic amino acid cluster on the interaction of Nef with artificial membrane systems. The results obtained with the wild type protein were compared with those ob-tained with a non-myristoylated mutant (Nef G2A) or with mutants with a reduced basic cluster (Nef KKAA, Nef R4A). Surprisingly, for all measurements performed with either large unilamellar vesicles or solid supported membranes, no stable binding of Nef to membranes was monitored even in the presence of the myristoyl anchor; in fact, the experiments show that the protein is able to perturb the membrane assembly ...",

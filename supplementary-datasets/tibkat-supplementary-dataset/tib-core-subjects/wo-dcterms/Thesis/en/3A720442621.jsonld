            "abstract": "Tropical humid mountain forests are hotspots of biodiversity and providers of important ecosystem services. In the light of increasing human pressure, effectively managed protected areas represent an important means to conserve these ecosystems. A fundamental basis for effective management of protected areas is the integration of scientific baseline data in management decisions. Especially in the tropics such baseline data are largely missing. This is also the case in our study area, Armando Berm\u00fadez National Park in the Dominican Republic. The aim of this research was to collect and analyze ecological and environmental data in this mountain national park and to provide baseline data for an improved management. The objectives of this study were: 1) Generation of a land cover/use map based on digital aerial photographs; 2) Analysis of the main vegetation types and modeling their spatial distribution; 3) Analysis of woody species richness/endemism and modeling their spatial distribution. For the land cover/use map 295 digital aerial photographs were orthorectified and mosaicked. The orthorectification process was hampered by the limited number of evenly distributed Ground Control Points and by the low textured aerial photos. Both the manual search for tie points and the integration of a Digital Elevation Model derived from 100 m contour lines led to a highly accurate orthorectification result. The visual interpretation of the mosaic was based on field samples, taking into account the characteristic elements of aerial photograph interpretation ...",

            "abstract": "Anaerobic methane oxidation, sulfate reduction, flux, ANME, sulfide, gas hydrate, chemosynthesis, cold seep. - Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a microbial process in marine sediments, by which sulfate is used as electron acceptor. The current hypothesis is that AOM is mediated by a consortium of methanotrophic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Research over the past 20 years has shown that AOM retains most of the methane in the sediment. In this thesis, the distribution and relevance of AOM in marine habitats with different methane fluxes was studied. Selected sediments and microbial mats were investigated to explain some of the factors regulating AOM. 1) At Hydrate Ridge, where fossil gases rise and gas hydrates dissociate in the surface sediment, AOM reveals some of the highest rates ever found in marine sediments and is characterized by high heterogeneity. 2) The sediments of Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay are characterized by high methane concentrations due to in situ methane production in organic-rich sediments. We were able to demonstrate that AOM is subject to seasonal changes. The organisms that mediate AOM in Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay ...",

            "abstract": "Climatic variations and human activity now and increasingly in the future cause land cover changes and introduce perturbations in the terrestrial carbon reservoirs in vegetation, soil and detritus. Optical remote sensing and in particular Imaging Spectroscopy has shown the potential to quantify land surface parameters over large areas, which is accomplished by taking advantage of the characteristic interactions of incident radiation and the physico-chemical properties of a material. The objective of this thesis is to quantify key soil parameters, including soil organic carbon, using field and Imaging Spectroscopy. Organic carbon, iron oxides and clay content are selected to be analyzed to provide indicators for ecosystem function in relation to land degradation, and additionally to facilitate a quantification of carbon inventories in semiarid soils. The semiarid Albany Thicket Biome in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa is chosen as study site. It provides a regional example for a semiarid ecosystem that currently undergoes land changes due to unadapted management practices and furthermore has to face climate change induced land changes in the future. The thesis is divided in three methodical steps. Based on reflectance spectra measured in the field and chemically determined constituents of the upper topsoil, physically based models are developed to quantify soil organic carbon, iron oxides and clay content. Taking account of the benefits limitations of existing methods, the approach is based on the direct application of known diagnostic spectral features and their combination with multivariate statistical approaches. It benefits from the collinearity of several diagnostic features and a number of their properties to reduce signal disturbances by influences of other spectral features. In a following step, the acquired hyperspectral image data are prepared for an analysis of soil constituents. The data show a large spatial heterogeneity that is caused by the patchiness of the natural vegetation in the study area that is inherent to most semiarid landscapes. Spectral mixture analysis is performed and used to deconvolve non-homogenous pixels into their constituent components. For soil dominated pixels, the subpixel information is used to remove the spectral influence of vegetation and to approximate the pure spectral signature coming from the soil. This step is an integral part when working in natural non-agricultural areas where pure bare soil pixels are rare. It is identified as the largest benefit within the multi-stage methodology, providing the basis for a successful and unbiased prediction of soil constituents from hyperspectral imagery. With the proposed approach it is possible (1) to significantly increase the spatial extent of derived information of soil constituents to areas with about 40 % vegetation coverage and (2) to reduce the influence of materials such as vegetation on the quantification of soil constituents to a minimum. Subsequently, soil parameter quantities are predicted by the application of the feature-based soil prediction models to the maps of locally approximated soil signatures. Thematic maps showing the spatial distribution of the three considered soil parameters in October 2009 are produced for the Albany Thicket Biome of South Africa. The maps are evaluated for their potential to detect erosion affected areas as effects of land changes and to identify degradation hot spots in regard to support local restoration efforts. A regional validation, carried out using available ground truth sites, suggests remaining factors disturbing the correlation of spectral characteristics and chemical soil constituents. The approach is developed for semiarid areas in general and not adapted to specific conditions in the study area. All processing steps of the developed methodology are implemented in software modules, where crucial steps of the workflow are fully automated. The transferability of the methodology is shown for simulated data of the future EnMAP hyperspectral satellite. Soil parameters are successfully predicted from these data despite intense spectral mixing within the lower spatial resolution EnMAP pixels. This study shows an innovative approach to use Imaging Spectroscopy for mapping of key soil constituents, including soil organic carbon, for large areas in a non-agricultural ecosystem and under consideration of a partially vegetation coverage. It can contribute to a better assessment of soil constituents that describe ecosystem processes relevant to detect and monitor land changes. The maps further provide an assessment of the current carbon inventory in soils, valuable for carbon balances and carbon mitigation products",

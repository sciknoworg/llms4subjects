            "title": "Functional specialization of Arabidopsis poly(A) polymerases in relation to flowering time and stress",
            "abstract": "Polyadenylation is a decisive 3\u2019 end processing step during the maturation of pre-mRNAs. The length of the poly(A) tail has an impact on mRNA stability, localization and translatability. Accordingly, many eukaryotic organisms encode several copies of canonical poly(A) polymerases (cPAPs). The disruption of cPAPs in mammals results in lethality. In plants, reduced cPAP activity is non-lethal. Arabidopsis encodes three nuclear cPAPs, PAPS1, PAPS2 and PAPS4, which are constitutively expressed throughout the plant. Recently, the detailed analysis of Arabidopsis paps1 mutants revealed a subset of genes that is preferentially polyadenylated by the cPAP isoform PAPS1 (Vi et al. 2013). Thus, the specialization of cPAPs might allow the regulation of different sets of genes in order to optimally face developmental or environmental challenges. To gain insights into the cPAP-based gene regulation in plants, the phenotypes of Arabidopsis cPAPs mutants under different conditions are characterized in detail in the following work. An involvement of all three cPAPs in flowering time regulation and stress response regulation is shown. While paps1 knockdown mutants flower early, paps4 and paps2 paps4 knockout mutants exhibit a moderate late-flowering phenotype. PAPS1 promotes the expression of the major flowering inhibitor FLC, supposedly by specific polyadenylation of an FLC activator. PAPS2 and PAPS4 exhibit partially overlapping functions and ensure timely flowering by repressing FLC and at least one other unidentified flowering inhibitor. The latter two cPAPs act in a novel regulatory pathway downstream of the autonomous pathway component FCA and act independently from the polyadenylation factors and flowering time regulators CstF64 and FY. Moreover, PAPS1 and PAPS2/PAPS4 are implicated in different stress response pathways in Arabidopsis. Reduced activity of the poly(A) polymerase PAPS1 results in enhanced resistance to osmotic and oxidative stress. Simultaneously, paps1 mutants are cold-sensitive. In contrast, PAPS2/PAPS4 are not involved in the regulation of osmotic or cold stress, but paps2 paps4 loss-of-function mutants exhibit enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress provoked in the chloroplast. Thus, both PAPS1 and PAPS2/PAPS4 are required to maintain a balanced redox state in plants. PAPS1 seems to fulfil this function in concert with CPSF30, a polyadenylation factor that regulates alternative polyadenylation and tolerance to oxidative stress. The individual paps mutant phenotypes and the cPAP-specific genetic interactions support the model of cPAP-dependent polyadenylation of selected mRNAs. The high similarity of the polyadenylation machineries in yeast, mammals and plants suggests that similar regulatory mechanisms might be present in other organism groups. The cPAP-dependent developmental and physiological pathways identified in this work allow the design of targeted experiments to better understand the ecological and molecular context underlying cPAP-specialization",

            "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common, severe, and chronic neurological diseases affecting approximately 1% of the world's population. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common epilepsy syndrome in adults. A large proportion of TLE patients (approx. 35-40%) respond not or inadequately to medication and show a progressive course of the disease with increasing frequency and severity of seizures. It is likely that each epileptic seizure promotes the development of new seizures. Despite considerable efforts, the molecular pathomechanisms of seizure development and chronification (epileptogenesis) are still largely unknown. However, there is increasing evidence of epigenetic changes as master switches\" in the control of pro-epileptogenic or seizure-associated gene expression. This project aims to systematically characterize cell-specific epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and related structural and functional changes in epileptogenesis. For this purpose, a neuronal primary cell culture model has been developed that demonstrated epileptogenic changes after transient addition of glutamate (10 \u00b5M for 10 min). Using calcium imaging, increased excitability and increasing synchronization of neuronal cells and networks in culture could be shown after a certain latency period. After 5-7 days of glutamate treatment, spontaneous recurrent SLEs could be recorded, which correspond in their profile to human seizures with a comparable duration. In cultures observed up to two weeks after glutamate stimulation, a further progression in terms of increasing seizure duration and severity was observed. The functional changes of the neuronal networks in the cultures correlated with extensive structural changes. The cellular composition of the network (e.g., glia, neurons, interneurons, progenitor cells), the dendrite length and branching of the neurons, as well as the synaptic plasticity, were investigated by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, epilepsy-associated candidate genes (ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, transcription ...\"",

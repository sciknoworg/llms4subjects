            "abstract": "The overall objectives of this thesis were (1) to evaluate a filter system to harvest plasma for identification of failure of passive transfer in newborn calves, (2) to evaluate 2 different treatment procedures after calving to improve harvesting of high-quantity and high-quality colostrum, and (3) to evaluate different analytical methods to assess failure of passive transfer in neonatal calves. To validate a filter system to harvest plasma for the assessment of failure of passive transfer (FPT) in neonatal calves, venous blood samples (serum and plasma) were withdrawn from 227 Holstein Friesian calves aged 1 to 7 d. Serum IgG concentrations were determined using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (gold standard), and failure of passive transfer was defined as IgG concentrations below 10 mg/mL. Serum was obtained through centrifugation, and plasma was extracted either through centrifugation or a disposable filter system (2-Drop-Filter, Pharmadoc, L\u00fcbeck, Germany). To assess the total proteins (TP) and total solids (TS) in serum and plasma, a handheld optical refractometer (Euromex Holland, Arnhem, the Netherlands) and 2 digital Brix refractometers (device 1: HI 96801 digital refractometer, Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, RI; device 2: Misco PA201, Misco, Solon, OH) were used. The optimal threshold for each device and each medium, i.e centrifuged serum, centrifuged plasma, and filtered plasma, was calculated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. The prevalence of failure of passive transfer in neonatal calves was 30% (67/227). The optimal threshold for the handheld optical refractometer using serum was 5.6 g/dL [sensitivity (Se) 70.1%; specificity (Sp) 80.0%; area under the curve (AUC) 0.85]. For centrifuged plasma, the optimal threshold was higher at 6.3 g/dL (Se 82.1%; Sp 68.1%; AUC 0.84), and for filtered plasma, the threshold was 6.0 g/dL (Se 56.7%; Sp 90.0%; AUC 0.80). The digital Brix refractometer (device 1: HI 96801) had the optimal threshold at 8.9% Brix using ...",

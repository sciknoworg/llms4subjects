            "abstract": "Acute phase is clinically characterized by homeostatic alterations such as somnolence, adinamia, fever, muscular weakness and leucocytosis. Dramatic changes in iron metabolism are observed under acute-phase conditions. Under conditions inducing non-hepatic tissue damage, serum iron level decreases. Liver is the central organ for iron homeostasis under physiological conditions. However, brain also requires iron for higher metabolic work under stress conditions. The exact mechanism and the changes of the gene expression and localization of the proteins involved in the iron regulation are not yet fully clarified. Current study aimed to compare the expressional changes and differential localization of the iron transport proteins; Transferrin receptor (TfR)-1 and 2, divalent-metal-transpoter-1 (DMT-1) and ferroportin-1(Fpn-1) in rat liver, brain and spleen during acute phase response due to experimental tissue damage. Muscle damage was induced by injecting turpentine-oil (TO) in hind limbs of rat and mice (wild type and IL-6 knock-out). Serum, liver, brain and spleen were removed. Serum and tissues were used for iron measurement ...",

            "abstract": "Primates have brains that are approximately twice as large as those of other similarly-sized mammals. Furthermore, also within the primate order brains have not only become increasingly large, but have also revealed a significant increase in cortical mass. The social brain hypothesis posits that this increase is due to the demands of life in a complex social group, and data regarding the relationship between brain size and social complexity support this view. Whether this pressure only affects &lsquo;social intelligence&rsquo; or leads to higher general cognitive capacities (including physical cognition) remains unclear. Furthermore, whether an increase in brains size predicts an increase in intelligence is highly debated. In the past years the bulk of research on the evolution of primate intelligence focused primarily on great apes and human children. To develop a full understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of primate intelligence, however, comparative data for monkeys are needed. Therefore I conducted a systematic interspecific comparison among and between apes and monkeys, covering a wide range of cognitive tasks, the so-called Primate Cognition Test Battery (PCTB). Specifically, I tested two Old World monkey species (olive baboons and long-tailed macaques) housed at the German Primate Center in G\u00f6ttingen and compared their performances to that of great apes tested by Herrmann and colleagues (2007). To get a better understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms that determined the monkeys&rsquo; performances and to assess the possible influence of different socio-ecological and phylogenetic factors on their capabilities, I analysed selected tasks in more detail and extended the test paradigms ...",

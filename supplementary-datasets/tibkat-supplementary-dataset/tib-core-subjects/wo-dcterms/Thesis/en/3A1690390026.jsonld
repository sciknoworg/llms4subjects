            "abstract": "Natural products and their derivatives have always been a source of drug leads. In particular, bacterial compounds have played an important role in drug development, for example in the field of antibiotics. A decrease in the discovery of novel leads from natural sources and the hope of finding new leads through the generation of large libraries of drug-like compounds by combinatorial chemistry aimed at specific molecular targets drove the pharmaceutical companies away from research on natural products. However, recent technological advances in genetics, bioinformatics and analytical chemistry have revived the interest in natural products. The ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a group of natural products generated by the action of post-translationally modifying enzymes on precursor peptides translated from mRNA by ribosomes. The great substrate promiscuity exhibited by many of the enzymes from RiPP biosynthetic pathways have led to the generation of hundreds of novel synthetic and semisynthetic variants, including variants carrying non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs). The microviridins are a family of RiPPs characterized by their atypical tricyclic structure composed of lactone and lactam rings, and their activity as serine protease inhibitors. [...]",

            "abstract": "Abstract: EBF1 is a key transcription factor regulating B lymphopoiesis. EBF1 has been shown to activate B cell- specific genes, repress genes associated with alternative lineages and \u201cpoise\u201d genes for expression at later stages of differentiation. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of EBF1 is required for the binding of na\u00efve progenitor chromatin, thus conferring \u201cpioneering\u201d activity upon EBF1 (57). Deletion of the CTD impairs EBF1 binding to a specific set of targets that includes genes involved B lineage specification. In contrast, another set of genes that are bound by EBF1 in concert with many other transcription factors do not depend of the CTD. Here, we delineated a small subdomain within the CTD, which is necessary and sufficient for its function. Through mass spectrometry analysis of binding partners of the EBF1 CTD, we identified FET family proteins, which are known for their phase separation properties. Bioinformatic analysis of the CTD predicted the small subdomain of the CTD as a prion-like intrinsically disordered region (IDR). In vitro assay also shows WT EBF1 protein phase separates as the salt concentration decreasing to physiological condition, while \u0394C EBF1 only shows much milder phase separation in the same condition compared to WT. After mixing EBF1 with FUS in vitro, WT EBF1 could be recruited to FUS liquid droplets, while \u0394C recruitment is much less. EBF1 forms puncta in the nuclei of primary progenitor B cells. Notably, these puncta possess liquid droplet characteristic, as determined by their sensitivity to 1,6-hexanediol treatment and their ability of fluorescent recovery after photo bleaching. These results lead to hypothesis that EBF1 C-tail very likely functions through the phase separation capacity of its intrinsically disordered region. The evidence that fusion of intrinsically disorder region from heterologous protein such as FET family and GATA3 to \u0394C, rescues the \u0394C defect further supports the hypothesis. Thus, the intrinsically disordered subdomain of the CTD may help EBF1 to access na\u00efve chromatin through its liquid-liquid phase separation property",

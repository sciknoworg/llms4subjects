            "abstract": "How does the brain work? This very broad and yet, very crucial and interesting question appealed scientists from various disciplines to itself. The fact that the operation of a system of neurons can not be understood without the collaboration of different sciences gave rise to the multi-disciplinary nature of neurosciences. For all the neuroscientists, the most basic question to deal with is how an individual neuron contributes to the rest of the system. Considering the brain as a computational unit, this question becomes as the understanding of the individual neuron as an information processor. The focus of this thesis project is understanding the mechanisms underlying the initiation of action potentials, which are the units of communication in a neural network, and the relation of these mechanisms with the important characteristics observed in real neurons, such as rapid action potential onsets and threshold variability. These characteristics are crucial and unique, and are in close relation with the linear response properties of neurons: For instance, the first few hundred microseconds of an action potential might reflect important properties of neural response, such as the ability of a neuron to respond efficiently to fast-changing time-varying inputs ...",

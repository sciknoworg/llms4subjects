            "title": "Modulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity by the human skin microbiome",
            "abstract": "With approximately 2 m2 the human skin is one of our largest organs and serves as the primary barrier against the external environment. As such, it is subject to environmental impacts and xenobiotic exposures. These include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Their ubiquitous occurrence results in constant human exposure, with many PAHs being suspected or established carcinogens. The best characterized model substance is benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) which is metabolized by eukaryotic cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases (CYPs) to form the highly mutagenic B[a]P-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE). Being environmental and industrial contaminants PAHs are predominantly addressed either for their environmental or toxicological fate. This includes their potential toxification and metabolism in eukaryotes as well as their microbial degradation in the environment. Yet, the latter is often driven by the PAHs potential to serve as a source of carbon and energy for microbial growth. With a plethora of underlying pathways this is as such of course also relevant for the human microbiome and the question of potential microbiome-mediated substance toxification. In preliminary work at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), it could be shown that PAH-metabolism is indeed a ubiquitous feature of the human skin microbiome. Using batch enrichment and skin swabs from 11 volunteers a total of 21 pure cultures were isolated, all of which used B[a]P as their sole source of carbon and energy. Building on these results this thesis subsequently investigated the respective microbial PAH-metabolism and \u2013toxification in vitro as well as assessing the potential host-impact and related microbiome-host interactions in situ. To address these questions in more detail a total of 4 skin isolates were examined further. These included two representatives of M. luteus, one B. licheniformis and one P. oleovorans, respectively. Using carbon-limited cultures, we could show that these skin commensals convert B[a]P into a number of highly ...",

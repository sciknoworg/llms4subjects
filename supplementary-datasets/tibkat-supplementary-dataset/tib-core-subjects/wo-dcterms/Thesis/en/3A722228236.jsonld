            "abstract": "It has been suggested that there are causal relationships between alterations in brain glia and major depression. In order to investigate whether a depressive-like state induces changes in brain astrocytes, we analyzed the modulation of astroglia-specific gene expression in the hippocampus of male rats using two models of chronic stress: chronic social stress (5 weeks, daily confrontations with a dominant male) and chronic restraint stress (3 weeks, immobilization 6h/day). Furthermore, the effects of chronic citalopram administration on hippocampal as well as prefrontal cortex (PFC) gene expression were assessed in the chronic social stress experiment.The expression of six astroglial genes was determined: N-myc-downregulated gene 2 (Ndrg2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), glutamate and aspartate transporter (GLAST), aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and the inward rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1). Furthermore, protein analyses in the hippocampus were performed by means of quantitative Western blots. Since so far, there was no reference gene validated for the PFC in experiments where animals were subjected to chronic social stress, the first step was to test several commonly used reference genes for expression stability in this part of the brain. In order to study hemispheric effects of stress in the PFC, the left and right hemispheres were analyzed separately ...",

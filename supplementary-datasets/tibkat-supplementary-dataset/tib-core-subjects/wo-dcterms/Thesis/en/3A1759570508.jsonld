            "abstract": "Abstract: This thesis is divided into 4 parts and they will lead to our main topic of gap phenomena in Lagrangian geometry. In the chapter one and two, we will review some general theories on the Willmore functionals and the Lagrangian geometry, we will also introduce our motivations and background problems there. The next chapter 3 is devoted to the gap phenomena in the area of the Willmore functional by Kuwert and Schatzle. The proof of their results is by developing a Simon's type identity ans using Bochner's technique to obtain the curvature estimates of second fundamental form and its trace-free part. Motived by their works, Luo and Wang developed a gap lemma for so called HW surfaces under the setting of Lagrangian geometry which will be introduced in chapter 4. But the study of the gap phenomena isn't completed. In the Euclidean case, the trace free part of the second fundamental form has a very nice geometrical meanings. Since a vanished trace free second fundamental form implies the surface to be a part of a plane or a standard sphere. However in Lagrangian geometry we can't use the classic trace free second fundamental form, instead we can consider the so called Lagrangian trace free second fundamental form which has a close relationship to a typical Lagrangian model, the Whitney sphere, due to Ros and Urbano's classification theorem. In the 5th chapter we will prove a Gap theorem for the Whitney sphere under the condition of small Lagrangian trace free second fundamental form. It can be viable through a classic result and oers a look at future prospects which is using this special trace free form to reformulate the Willmore equations",

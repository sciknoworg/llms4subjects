            "abstract": "Ubiquitin dependent protein degradation is a common principle in eukaryotic organisms to control appropriate temporal and spatial protein levels. Abnormal regulation leads to embryonic lethality in plants, insects and mammals and is responsible for the development of certain types of cancer in humans. Substrate specificity of degradation is mediated by E3-ubiquitin ligases, of which most contain a cullin as the core component. Cullin containing ligases are regulated by covalent modification with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8. The COP9 signalosome (CSN) and the deneddylating protein 1 (DEN1) are two abundant deneddylases capable of removing Nedd8 from CRLs. This study employs the fungal model organism Aspergillus nidulans to explore the function of deneddylation for development. (i) The homolog of DEN1 in the fungus, DenA, was identified and the developmental function was investigated. Genetic experiments revealed a crucial function of denA for the promotion of asexual development and the repression of sexual fruit body formation in the presence of light. Biochemical studies, as well as molecular and genetic analysis clearly indicate a deneddylase activity of DenA. Double deletion of denA and csnE results in a strain that can only grow vegetative. Impairment of asexual as well as sexual development in the double knock-out suggests that some developmental functions are shared between the two deneddylases. Both, denA and csnE deletion strains display distinct phenotypic characteristics, but overlap in their inability to inhibit the initiation of sexual development in light ...",

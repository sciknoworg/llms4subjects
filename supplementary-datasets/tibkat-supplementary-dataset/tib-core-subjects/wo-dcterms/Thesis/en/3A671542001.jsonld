            "abstract": "In the presented work the possibility of signal enhancement of high-resolution nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) in aqueous solution, with the intent of application to macromolecular biomolecules, was investigated.  Using stable radicals and microwave irradiation at low magnetic field (0.34 T), fast sample transfer to a high magnetic field (14.09 T) and following signal acquisition it was demonstrated that it is possible to observe dynamical nuclear polarization (DNP). Signal enhancement factors of up to 16 have been achieved. Furthermore the prerequisites and mechanisms of polarization transfer from the unpaired electrons of the radicals to the nuclei were investigated. In a further part of the work the NMR-based INPHARMA method for structural characterization of receptor-ligand-interaction in the context of structure-based drug design was extended so that it became possible to use the experimental data to directedly improve structural models by computational means. The necessary theoretical foundations have been formulated and were implemented into the software package XPLOR-NIH to allow for structure determination based on gradient and simulated annealing protocols.",

            "abstract": "Neurons in the mammalian primary visual cortex (V1) are often preferentially driven by only one of the two eyes and respond best to oriented bar stimuli at a particular position in the visual field. Most carnivorans and primates exhibit ordered columns of eye preference referred to as ocular dominance maps (ODMs). Similarly, orientation preferences in the V1 of these species are arranged into smooth and roughly periodic orientation preference maps (OPMs). Glires (rodents and lagomorphs), although in part clearly visual animals, apparently lack any orderly arrangement of preferred orientations. It is still controversial whether and how these dichotomic V1 functional architectures can be explained by the self-organized activity-dependent development of neuronal circuits and to what degree their development is influenced or dominated by biological constraints. In this dissertation, I investigate how simple optimization dynamics and biological constraints can be used to understand quantitative features of the V1 circuits in carnivorans and primates on the one side and Glires on the other. First, I focus on the interaction between postnatal brain growth and the development of ODMs in cat V1. I find that cat ODMs reorganize during a period of considerable postnatal growth. Characteristic features of this reorganization as well as the time scale on which it evolves are in good agreement with the predicted brain-growth-induced reorganizations in an optimization model for the activity-dependent formation of ODMs. Second, I develop a general mathematical formalism to analytically calculate OPMs predicted by optimization models for OPM development ...",

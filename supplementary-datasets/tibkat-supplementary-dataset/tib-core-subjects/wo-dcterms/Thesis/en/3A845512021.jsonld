            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: In the present work, a novel front side metallization architecture for silicon solar cells based on a fine printed silver seed-layer, plated with nickel, copper and silver, is investigated. Practical challenges with this type of metallization motivated associated research, and scientific insights into different aspects of this metallization approach and beyond were obtained. The work focuses on the printing of fine seed-layers with low silver consumption using screen-printing, the corrosion of the printed seed-layers by the interaction with electrolyte solutions and the encapsulation material on module level and on the long term stability of the cells due to copper migration.To realize fine contact structures and simultaneously low silver consumption by screen-printing a high yield stress of >400 Pa for the silver pastes were shown to be beneficial. Fine contact fingers with a width of 30 \u03bcm were reproducibly printed. Seed-layers printed with ink-jet, aerosol-jet, screen-printing and flexographic printing were used to produce industrial scale 156 \u00d7 156 mm2 solar cells. A total silver consumption for the front side metallization of less than 15 mg/cell was achieved with screen-printed seed-layers. This represents a reduction of the silver consumption of at least 80% compared to solar cells with fully screen-printed silver front side contacts.The analysis of the contact corrosion due to interaction with the electrolyte solutions revealed that a site specific dissolution of the glass layer inside the fired contacts is responsible for the observed contact adhesion loss. A model of the underlying reaction mechanism was developed which explains the experimental results and provides profound understanding of the interaction between solar cell contacts and electrolyte solutions. It was found that lead glass is dissolved within the acidic aqueous systems. Several factors were identified to shift this equilibrium in favour of pronounced glass dissolution, especially the presence of complexion or precipitation agents, low pH and a cathodic potential.The acceleration of the contact corrosion by a cathodic voltage was found to depend on the nobility of further ions in the system. If noble ions like silver or copper are present, the reduction of these species at the silver contact is preferred compared to the reduction of the dissolved lead, whereas ions similarly or less noble than lead, like nickel, enable the reduction of the dissolved species, whi ...",

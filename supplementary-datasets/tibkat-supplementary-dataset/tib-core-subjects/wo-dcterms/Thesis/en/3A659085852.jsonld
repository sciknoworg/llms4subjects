            "abstract": "This thesis investigates monitoring and fault management of next generation networks, in particular in environments where the network nodes within an Autonomous System (AS) are centrally controlled and managed. Existing works on network monitoring and fault management are developed in an isolated and extremely complex manner where the management protocols, such as SNMP, IPFIX and PSAMP, are separately designed and deployed without an overall consideration. To address this issue we propose a systematic framework for network monitoring and fault management, which takes account of monitoring protocol, traffic matrix composition and derivation, system rebooting, dynamic fault management and related security issues. We propose a new network monitoring framework which exploits the extensibility of the Internet Protocol (IP), especially for IP Version 6 (IPv6), the fundamental building block for next generation networks. This is implemented by defining a new IPv6 hop-by-hop extension header. Messages with such header would be able to carry metrics related to node and links along the path when they traverse the network. This approach is augmented with a path-based intrinsic monitoring protocol, which can effectively associate SNMP-based MIB information to a network path within the AS domain ...",

            "abstract": "Small-molecule optical probes have proven to be valuable tools for research and preclinical applications and are successively being incorporated into clinical practice as indispensable sensitive imaging diagnostics that allow for the non-invasive real-time monitoring of pathological alterations on a molecular level. The present work deals with the development, characterization, and application of novel enzyme-activatable optical probes based on the DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) scaffold as central, multifunctionalizable and highly flexible template. Within the first project of this work, the development of a sophisticated dual functional DOTAM-based fluorescent probe for cancer imaging is presented, combining favorable features of a targeted probe and a substrate-based probe. The probe comprises the DOTAM-scaffold as inherent structural motif of a cathepsin S activatable internally quenched fluorescent (IQF) substrate, as well as cRGDfK peptidic ligands that preferentially bind to \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrins, thus combining recognition motifs for two highly relevant and specific cancer targets. Biochemical profiling revealed that the probe and a non-targeted control analogue feature excellent in vitro activation kinetics towards cathepsin S exhibiting site-specific cleavage of the sequence, and that they are stable in presence of a series of common intracellular bioanalytes. Comparison to the non-targeted control probe revealed significantly better staining intensity of cancer cells for the dual functional probe, which correlated with the extent of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 receptors on the different cell lines. Moreover, staining was significantly impaired upon preincubation with cRGDfK peptide or the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d, implying integrin-mediated uptake and cathepsin-mediated activation of the targeted cathepsin S probe in cancer cells. In contrast, application in a healthy cell line resulted in negligible fluorescence intensities, suggesting high overall selectivity of the probe for cancer cells ...",

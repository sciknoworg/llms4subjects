            "abstract": "East Greenland, seismic reflection, sediment distribution. - Geophysical and geological investigations in the Arctic region are very important for a better understanding of the present day global climate. Changes in global climate is one of the highly speculative aspect in the Northern Hemipsphere, especially the onset of glaciation. Advances and retreats of grounded ice sheets during glacial-interglacial times play an important role in terms of the deposition of large sediment deposits. Depositional pattern on the continental slope and rise reflect interactions between the effects of ice sheet fluctuations, mass transport processes and bottom currents. The main focus of this thesis is the sedimentation history along the East Greenland margin in late Cenozoic times. Different seismic reflection surveys gathered between 1997 and 2003, represent the sedimentary structure along this margin from the shelf up into the deep sea area. A for the first time an applied seismostratigraphy on the Northeast Greenland margin made it possible to differenciate between glacial (younger than middle Miocene) and pre-glacial (older than middle Miocene) sediment units. Glacial advances and retreats appear not synchronous along the continental margin. Therefore, either north of 70 degrees N the extension of the shelf by glacial erosion seems to be more intensive like on the Southeast Greenland margin or the onset of glaciation started earlier in the north than in the south. The results of the modelling of different sediment maps enables a lot of varibiabilities in the sediment supply along the continental margin. The greatest total sediment amount is observed in the prolongation of glacial drainage outlets like the Scoresby Sund. Other influences on the sediment thickness along ...",

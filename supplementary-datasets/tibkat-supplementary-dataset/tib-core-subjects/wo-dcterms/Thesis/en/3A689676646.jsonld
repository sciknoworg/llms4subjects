            "abstract": "Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a potent inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a key regulator of purine biosynthesis. MPA is frequently used as an immunosuppressant drug to prevent acute graft rejection for kidney, liver and lung transplantation. The use of MPA is associated with GI toxicity which is a problem to the patients, and a challenge for clinicians. The present study was undertaken to identify novel molecular targets of MPA using a proteomics approach. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry were used to identify proteome alterations in human embryonic cells (HEK-293) following exposure to therapeutic concentrations of MPA. Cells were treated for 72 hours, and total cell lysate was resolved by 2-DE followed by QTOF-MS/MS analysis of all identified differentially regulated proteins. A total of 12 proteins were differentially regulated in HEK-293 cells following exposure to MPA. Among these, 7 proteins were up-regulated (complement component 1 Q subcomponent-binding protein, electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit, peroxiredoxin 1, thioredoxin domain-containing protein 12, myosin  ...",

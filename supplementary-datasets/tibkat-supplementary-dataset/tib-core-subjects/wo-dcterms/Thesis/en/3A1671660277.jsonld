            "abstract": "The energy sector is regarded as one of the decisive subsystems influencing the future of sustainable development. Consequently, there is a need for a comprehensive transformation of energy generation, conversion and use. The importance of building capacities for energy policy development in developing countries is bound up with the need to formulate global strategies to meet the challenges that humanity face, especially to achieve the targets manifested in the Agenda 2030 and Paris Agreement. The aim of this research is to better understand how to empower marginalised key societal actors, co-produce alternative discourses about energy futures and articulate those discourses to influence policy change within a context of illiberal democracies in Latin America. The research concerns the design, function and effectiveness of scientifically grounded participatory process, which has been justified theoretically and tested empirically. The process presupposes theoretical perspectives relating to theory, method and empirical application. The first draws on theories of sustainability transition and transformation, including transition management. The second draws on ideas taken from the knowledge co-production and transdisciplinary sustainability research. The empirical application, concerns the implementation of a Transdisciplinary Transition Management Arena (TTMA) and its effectiveness, measured by potential for the co-production of knowledge and for stimulating collective action. As result of the process, a conceptual model of the energy system, long-term visions and transformation strategies were developed. The TTMA processes demonstrated that cross-sectoral and inter-institutional, combined efforts, can help actors visualize possible, future alternatives for sustainable energy development and how to realize such alternatives. The structures provided were helpful for the emergence and empowerment of new sustainable-energy-transition coalitions in both Ecuador and Peru. Chapter 1 describes the general context in which this scientific project is developed and presents a synthesis of the processes and its main outcomes. The research results are described in detail in the scientific papers presented in chapters 2,3 and 4.",

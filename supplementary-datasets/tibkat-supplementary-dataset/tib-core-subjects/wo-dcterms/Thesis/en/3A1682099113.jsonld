            "abstract": "Abstract: Mitochondrial apoptosis is a form of controlled cell death used to remove defective or unwanted cells of a multicellular organism, acting in its development and maintenance.<br>As the name suggests, the mitochondrion lies at the heart of mitochondrial apoptosis: the permeabilization of its outer membrane (MOMP) is the critical step in the signaling pathway. MOMP allows the release of death-inducing factors from the organelle into the cytoplasm, sealing the fate of a cell during apoptosis.<br>The Bcl-2 family consists of proteins whose complex interplay regulates the molecular events upstream of MOMP. The family is sub-divided into two groups with opposing functionalities: the pro- and the anti-apoptotic ones, with the pro-apoptotic group further containing the multidomain pore-forming and the BH3-only members.<br>BH3-only proteins act as sensors of cellular stress and activate the pore-forming Bax and Bak. Mobilization of those proteins causes MOMP and can occur either directly through a BH3-only protein binding to Bax/Bak, or indirectly by blocking the hydrophobic groove of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, thus neutralizing them.<br>Bim is a potent BH3-only member, which is subject to several forms of regulation, including adjustment of its expression level. Furthermore, there are several factors which modulate interaction of Bim with other members of the Bcl-2 family. Dynein light chain 1 (DLC1) has been proposed to sequester Bim to the cytoskeleton and away from the mitochondria, inactivating it. Interestingly, a similar mechanism has been described for another BH3-only protein: Bmf, which can bind to the highly homologous DLC2.<br>Nevertheless, recent publications have shown that Bim and Bmf, rather than being sequestered by the cytoskeleton, are associated with mitochondria in healthy cells. In addition, further molecular functions like induction of dimerization and structural stabilization of its binding partners have been described for DLC.<br>The first focus of this study was the structural and functional analysis of the Bim- and Bmf-DLC interaction. Since such interactions are difficult to interrogate in intact cells, we decided to use recombinant proteins. We therefore designed a purification strategy, which allowed us to produce highly pure, full-length versions of the Bcl-2 family proteins BimL, Bmf, Mcl-1 and Bak, as well as the DLC1 and DLC2.<br>We found that recombinant BimL and Bmf spontaneously insert into isolated mitochondria as  ...",

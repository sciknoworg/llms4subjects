            "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with equilibrium problems with equilibrium constraints or EPECs. Concretely, we consider models composed by coupling together two-level optimization problems, the upper-level solutions to which are non-cooperative (Nash-Cournot) equilibria. One of the main goals of the thesis involves the formulation of dual stationarity conditions to EPECs. A model of oligopolistic competition for electricity markets is considered as an application. In order to profit from qualitative hypotheses concerning the structure of the considered models, e.g., inactivity of certain market participants at equilibrium, as well as to provide conditions useful for numerical procedures, the ablilty to formulate EPEC solutions in relation to the input data of the problem is of considerable importance. The way to do this requires a structural analysis of the involved optimization problems, e.g., constraints qualifications, regularity; the derivation of stability results for certain multivalued mappings, and the usage of transformation formulae for so-called coderivatives. Further important topics address the relationship between various dual stationarity types, e.g., S- and M-stationarity, as well as the extension of the considered problem classes to a stochastic setting, i.e., stochastic EPECs or SEPECs.",

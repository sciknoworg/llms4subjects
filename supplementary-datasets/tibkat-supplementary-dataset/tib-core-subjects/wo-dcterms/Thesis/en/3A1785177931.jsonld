            "abstract": "The computational power of work stations and supercomputers in data centers has increased almost exponentially in the last decades, at least when measured by the number of theoretical possible floating point operations per second. In this work, I use these resources to study chemical processes related to the surface chemistry of zinc oxide (ZnO), in particular, the efficient coupling of small linker molecules in the formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and the deactivation of hazardous chemicals from the environment. The adsorption of small molecules on ZnO is investigated purely by static geometry optimizations, whereas also ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) is employed in the study of the decomposition of hazardous materials. Although, both static and dynamic calculations, use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the atomic forces acting on the atoms, the two methods have vastly different demands on the computational resources. This fact finally triggered the third and largest project of my thesis, the performance optimization of the ab initio molecular dynamics code CPMD. In the first two parts of my thesis, the investigations on the interaction of molecules with a ZnO surface, I study two very different scientific questions: on the one hand, I determine the most stable binding motif of phenyl phosphonic acid (PPA) anchor groups in the formation of functional molecular films, on the other hand, I assess the applicability of ZnO for the catalytic deactivation of sulfur mustard (SM). Even though both studies focus on different aspects of the interaction between molecules and a ZnO surface, the applied modeling methods are very similar. The project on the adsorption of PPA on ZnO is done in close cooperation with the experimental groups of Prof. Dr. Gregor Witte and Prof. Dr. Stefanie Dehnen at the Philipps- University Marburg, Germany. Only their very detailed experimental studies allow me to narrow down my calculations such that I am able to provide essential new insights into the adsorption ...",

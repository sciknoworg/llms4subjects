            "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous and found in the atmosphere, aquatic environment, sediments and soils. For environmental risk assessments and the allocation of the polluter it is important to know the PAH sources. PAH contamination sites are usually the result of anthropogenic processes. Three major sources are known: i) petroleum, including crude oil and its refined products and coals (petrogenic PAHs), ii) burning of organic matter (pyrogenic PAHs) and iii) transformation products of natural organic precursors present in the environment (diagenetic processes). PAH contamination sites, which are influenced by almost all these anthropogenic processes are often river bank soils. In one case elevated PAH concentrations were found in river bank soils when building a retention area along the Mosel River. The source of the PAHs in this area was unclear and required the investigation of possible sources. To evaluate the PAH distribution along the Mosel River, a section of ~ 160 km along the river and a short section along the Saar River were investigated within this study. Concentrations of the \u00d316 EPA PAHs were as high as 81 mg kg-1 dry weight (dw). Additionally, coal particles were identified in some soils, which originated from mining activities in the Saarland region. PAH distribution patterns of the sixteen EPA PAHs suggest a mainly pyrogenic origin and in some cases a mixture of pyrogenic and petrogenic origin. For further source identifications a more detailed investigation was recommended and performed ...",

            "abstract": "Compactly, this thesis encompasses two major parts to examine mechanical responses of polymer compounds and two dimensional materials:  1- Molecular dynamics approach is investigated to study transverse impact behavior of polymers, polymer compounds and two dimensional materials.  2- Large deflection of circular and rectangular membranes is examined by employing continuum mechanics approach.  Two dimensional materials (2D), including, Graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),  exhibited new and promising physical and chemical properties, opening new opportunities to be utilized alone or to enhance the performance of conventional materials. These 2D materials have attracted tremendous attention owing to their outstanding physical properties, especially concerning transverse impact loading.  Polymers, with the backbone of carbon (organic polymers) or do not include carbon atoms in the backbone (inorganic polymers) like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), have extraordinary characteristics particularly their flexibility leads to various easy ways of forming and casting. These simple shape processing label polymers as an excellent material often used as a matrix in composites (polymer compounds).     In this PhD work, Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) is implemented to calculate transverse impact loading of 2D materials as well as polymer compounds reinforced with graphene sheets. In particular, MD was adopted to investigate perforation of the target and impact resistance force . By employing MD approach, the minimum velocity of the projectile that could create perforation and passes through the target is obtained. The largest investigation was focused on how graphene could enhance the impact properties of the compound. Also the purpose of this work was to discover the effect of the atomic arrangement of 2D materials on the impact problem. To this aim, the impact properties of two different 2D materials, graphene and MoS2, are studied. The simulation of chemical functionalization was carried out systematically, either with covalently bonded molecules or with non-bonded ones, focusing the following efforts on the covalently bounded species, revealed as the most efficient linkers.",

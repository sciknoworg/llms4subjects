            "abstract": "Soil colloids are classified to be in a size range of 1nm to 1\u00e6m. Their huge specific surface determines the interactions of the soil colloids, which differ from the behaviour of the same material in a bulk system. For a long time, this led for example to an underestimation of matter transport through the soil matrix, which is of major impact when it comes for example to toxicants reaching the ground water. Despite their relevance, the interactions of soil colloids are not understood yet. For the investigation of the dynamics in the colloidal systems, both high spatial resolution and the allowance of a complete and natural colloidal system, thus an aqueous system of at least several micrometre thickness, are necessary. These requirements are uniquely matched by soft X-ray microscopy. The spatial resolution of 20nm to 50nm matches with the colloidal size range, and due to the advantageous absorption features in the soft X-ray energy range, water layers of up to 10 \u00e6m thickness can be penetrated while a natural contrast is given for soil colloids. Thus, high resolution micrographs of soil samples in aqueous media can be obtained. Furthermore, by taking images at two different X-ray energies, elemental mapping can be applied to identify e.g. iron containing particles within the heterogeneous soil sample unambiguously ...",

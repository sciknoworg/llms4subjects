            "abstract": "Lipids and lipidic natural products occupy a pivotal role in the lifestyle of all organisms. To study their functions, access to synthetic standards and chemical tools is urgently needed. This thesis describes the total synthesis of three distinct lipidic natural products and the development of chemical probes for the deconvolution of their intriguing biological roles. In the first part, bacterial sulfonospingolipid, IOR-1A, was synthesized with a newly developed and modular total synthesis entailing a late-stage diversification step via decarboxylative cross-coupling, which allowed the preparation of IOR-1A-derived chemical probes. These probes were used in fluorescence microscopy and proteomics experiments to study the multicellular rosette-forming inhibitory activity of IOR-1A on the closest living single-celled relative to humans, the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta. The second part of the thesis elaborates on the first total synthesis of the fungal natural product sphingofungin C, a sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor. The highly modular approach entailed a decarboxylative amino acid synthesis enabling access to sphingofungin A, B, D, and four unnatural sphingofungin derivatives while being the shortest synthetic route reported towards this natural product family. Evaluation of the biological properties of the afforded sphingofungins suggested that this lipidic compound class could serve as a starting point for the development of new anti-protozoan therapies. The final part of this thesis discusses the first total synthesis of barnesin A, a newly discovered bacterial natural product. The novel synthetic approach allowed the elucidation of the correct stereochemistry of this lipodipeptide. Furthermore, the synthetically afforded quantities enabled the evaluation of barnesin A\u2019s inhibitory properties against a selection of proteases ultimately leading to the discovery that this intriguing natural product is a selective cysteine protease inhibitor.",

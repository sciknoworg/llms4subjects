            "abstract": "The lifestyle of Staphylococcus aureus leads to skin infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, especially in immunocompromised patients. In addition, the ability of S. aureus to form biofilms and the increasing occurrence of antibiotic-resistant variants causes serious problems not only in hospitals. In order to understand more about the virulence behaviour of S. aureus, proteins of unknown function offer new possibilities. In this study, the function of the previously hypothetical protein NWMN_0364 was analyzed. At the beginning there was only evidence that indicated a cell wall or virulence function. Using an infection assay, it could be shown that an S. aureus strain with a deletion mutation of the NWMN_0364 gene had a significantly reduced virulence. In order to find the reason for this reduced virulence, extracellular proteins were examined with a proteomic approach. This revealed that many virulence factors that are regulated by the SaeRS virulence regulation system were reduced in the deletion mutant. In addition, SaeP, the negative regulator of SaeRS, was less abundant in the mutant. This possible connection of NWMN_0364 with SaeRS was verified by transcription analyses, which showed that the transcripts of the sae operon and the virulence factors were reduced in the mutant. Interestingly, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in vivo revealed evidence of an interaction between NWMN_0364 and SaeP. To confirm this interaction, recombinant proteins from SaeP and NWMN_0364 were used, which showed an interaction in vitro. Using cross-linking experiments, NWMN_0364 showed that it binds to SaeP mainly with the C-terminal PepSY domain. Taken together, a hypothesis of the function of NWMN_0364 was created based on the experimental results of this study. NWMN_0364 is important for virulence activation through binding to SaeP and thus activation of the SaeRS system. Based on these findings, the protein NWMN_0364 was renamed PepSY containing, virulence regulating protein\" (Pvr).",

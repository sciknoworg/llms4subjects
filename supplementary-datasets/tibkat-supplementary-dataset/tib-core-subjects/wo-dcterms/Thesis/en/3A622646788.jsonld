            "abstract": "Interference, Wireles multi-hop ad hoc networks, Radio Disjont Multipath, Flow distribution. - In wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks, the simultaneous use of multiple routes may degrade the performance of applications due to mutual interference of discovered paths, irrespective of whether paths are physically node disjoint or link disjoint. Therefore, the selection of noninterfering routes is the main criterion to be addressed when using multiple routes simultaneously. This thesis introduces a new metric to select multiple routes by reducing the effect of interference between paths as far as possible and also selecting the least congested paths. The proposed protocol is named Radio Disjoint Multipath (RDM). The concept of the RDM protocol which can be applied to both reactive and proactive ad hoc protocols is developed and feasibility of the protocol is proven by an implementation and also through an analytical model. Furthermore, this thesis introduces a novel mechanism to distribute multiple flows as well as packets of a single flow based on the properties of the discovered path, which is computed considering the Background Traffic Load (BTL) of each path and the mutual interference between paths. In summary, all investigations presented in this thesis can help to enhance the application performance in different kinds of wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks of Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANET), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), by discovering RDM routes and using them simultaneously.",

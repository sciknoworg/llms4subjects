            "abstract": "Abstract: The work described in this thesis is an investigation of scalar-tensor theories.<br>Scalar-tensor theories generalise Einstein's theory of relativity by replacing the univeral coupling constant of gravity, the Planck mass, with a dynamical scalar field.<br>One motivation to consider scalar-tensor theories can be found within cosmology itself. Observations indicate that, during the very early universe, space underwent a period of accelerated expansion. This phase of expansion is called inflation. The most common method to implement inflation introduces a new scalar field to  generate the required vacuum energy.<br>It is not yet clear what the fundamental nature of this scalar field should be, and general relativity does not provide an answer to this question. Scalar-tensor theories, on the other hand, naturally explain the existence of such a field. During inflation it can be expected that tiny quantum gravitational corrections can be found in the imprint of the cosmic microwave background radiation. These corrections can be studied within the formalism of quantum geometrodynamics, which is a canonical, non-perturbative theory of quantum gravity. An important object in this formalism is the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, which governs the dynamics of the quantised degrees of freedom. Although the Wheeler-DeWitt equation describes a full theory of quantum gravity, it has a well-defined classical limit, and quantum gravitational corrections can be systematically derived from a semiclassical expansion.<br><br>The thesis starts with a review of the formalism of general relativity. It introduces a general class of scalar-tensor theories, and presents its properties. It reviews the formalism of inflation, and ends with the presentation of the formalism of inflation within the context of a general scalar-tensor theory.<br><br>Furthermore, it presents the consequences of a general scalar-tensor theory in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity. The basis for this investigation is the canonical approach to quantum gravity, called quantum geometrodynamics.<br>This is a canonical and non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity, in which the Hamiltonian of the theory of general relativity is quantised in an analogous way as in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The formalism is generalised to a general class of scalar-tensor theories. It is demonstrated how quantum geometrodynamics can be used to estimate the form and magnitude of the first quantum gravit ...",

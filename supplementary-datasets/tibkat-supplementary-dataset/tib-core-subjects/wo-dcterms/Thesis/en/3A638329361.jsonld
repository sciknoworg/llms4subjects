            "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) plays an important role in medical imaging. In contrast to techniques like Computerized Tomography (CT) providing information about the anatomy of the patients body, PET can be used to study the metabolism of the patient. Often both, functional and morphological, devices are combined in a single system in order to benefit from both techniques. Although PET is already used in daily routine, improvements in the underlying mathematical model are still possible. In general, the X-ray transform is used the analytical model for PET. The main drawback of this model in connection with PET is the fact that it is only suitable for particles that travel along straight rays. Scattered particles, which are a major problem in quantitative PET, are not considered by this model. In order to use the straight line model the scatter fraction is usually estimated based on physical considerations and subtracted from the measured data. After this correction the X-ray transform can be assumed as the correct model for PET. Obviously, this data correction leads to reduced statistics and strictly speaking the model is still  somehow wrong for PET ...",

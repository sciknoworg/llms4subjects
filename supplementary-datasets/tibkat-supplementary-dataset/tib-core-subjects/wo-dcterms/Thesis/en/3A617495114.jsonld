            "abstract": "The main topic of this dissertation are marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) in numerical general relativity. MOTSs are closed two-dimensional surfaces around black holes, at which the expansion of outgoing null rays vanishes. They are used to determine the approximate location of the event horizon at one instant of time or to give the mass and spin of the enclosed black hole. It was examined whether or how MOTSs can overlap when two black holes come close to each other. In contrast to previously published results from other groups no overlap was found, neither for the axisymmetric case nor for the inspiraling case of two black holes. This discrepancy was explained by the use of embedding diagrams. MOTSs are described by an elliptic partial differential equation. Newton methods can solve these kinds of problems. One change was examined that enlarges the convergent regime for these methods. For that the function under consideration was multiplied by an appropriate term. Alongside it was considered how eigenvalues can serve as an indicator for the convergence of the Newton method. These eigenvalues are taken from the iteration matrix that appears when solving one step of the Newton iteration. It is not possible to show the predictive power with mathematical rigour. Nevertheless in praxis the method shows good results.",

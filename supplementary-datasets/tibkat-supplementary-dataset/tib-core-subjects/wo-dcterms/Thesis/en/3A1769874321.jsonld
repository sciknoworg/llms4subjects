            "abstract": "In the last decades, additive manufacturing -commonly referred to as 3D printing- has gained growing attention driven by increasing digitalization in industry and the biomedical sector. The expression additive manufacturing is used to describe a variety of manufacturing technologies that produce construction parts in a layer-by-layer approach based on CAD files. In comparison to traditional subtractive manufacturing processes, additive manufacturing allows the cheap production of highly complex, individualized specimens in small product series in a short time. These advantages are particularly attractive for the biomedical sector to produce surgical models and patient-specific implants. In this context, the powder bed fusion laser beam melting process of polymers (PBF-LB/P) is very capable to produce geometrically complex and porous specimens for their use as bone implants. However, the choice of suitable powder materials is very limited up to now. The available materials can be divided into two categories of unfilled polymeric powders, which are almost exclusively based on polyamide 12, and a few filled composite powders. These composite powders are physical mixtures on the micrometer scale of polyamide 12 and additives such as carbon fibers or glass beads. This limited material selection results from the high material requirements imposed by the powder bed fusion process (PBF-LB/P). A suitable powder material needs to provide a wide thermal process window, a well-developed adsorption behavior in the wavelength of the CO2 laser, and high powder flowability. In this PhD thesis, a colloid-based bottom-up process chain is presented to produce tailored supraparticles for the powder fusion process (PBF-LB/P). In a first step, polymeric and additive primary particle dispersions are prepared. These dispersions are then spray dried either as a pure polymeric dispersion to produce polymer supraparticles or as a dispersion mixture to produce composite supraparticles. The dispersion droplet serves as confinement for the ...",

            "abstract": "Business process management has become a key instrument to organize work as many companies represent their operations in business process models. Recently, business process choreography diagrams have been introduced as part of the Business Process Model and Notation standard to represent interactions between business processes, run by different partners. When it comes to the interactions between services on the Web, Representational State Transfer (REST) is one of the primary architectural styles employed by web services today. Ideally, the RESTful interactions between participants should implement the interactions defined at the business choreography level. The problem, however, is the conceptual gap between the business process choreography diagrams and RESTful interactions. Choreography diagrams, on the one hand, are modeled from business domain experts with the purpose of capturing, communicating and, ideally, driving the business interactions. RESTful interactions, on the other hand, depend on RESTful interfaces that are designed by web engineers with the purpose of facilitating the interaction between participants on the internet. In most cases however, business domain experts are unaware of the technology behind web service interfaces and web engineers tend to overlook the overall business goals of web services. [...]",

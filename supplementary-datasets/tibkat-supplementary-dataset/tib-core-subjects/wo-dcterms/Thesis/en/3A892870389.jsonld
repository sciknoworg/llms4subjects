            "abstract": "Abstract: Tunable lenses are crucial elements for a wide range of applications including wavefront<br>sensors and miniaturized imaging systems. However, the profile of conventional<br>tunable lens is spherical, rendering them inherently prone to spherical aberration.<br>The practical implication of this is the narrowing of the usable optical aperture. For<br>space limited imaging applications, this is a significant factor limiting the imaging<br>performance. To overcome this limitation, a novel type of aspherical tunable lens<br>with an optimized aspherical profile over a focal length range is necessary.<br>To realize a diffraction-limited tunable aspherical lens, in this thesis, for the first<br>time a generalized method to design liquid-tunable aspherical lenses based on a variable<br>thickness membrane is presented. The iterative design method uses analytical<br>methods, finite element analysis simulations and ray tracing analysis to optimize the<br>membrane profile, such that the spherical aberration can be reduced under uniform<br>pressure load.<br>Based on this method, a first prototype lens with 2.75mm aperture is designed<br>to achieve diffraction-limited performance. Near diffraction-limited performance at<br>the nominal focal length of 7.6mm is experimentally demonstrated.<br>Using the same method, a second prototype lens is developed by engineering the<br>membrane profile, yielding a membrane stiff enough to withstand gravity-induced<br>aberrations when the lens is oriented in vertical direction, and which can be shaped<br>into a perfect optical surface under pressure load. A 3mm diameter lens is realized<br>and experimentally demonstrated orientation independent diffraction-limited<br>performance at the nominal focal length of 8 mm. A drastic reduction in spherical<br>aberration is documented compared to conventional liquid-tunable lenses.<br>Apart from acting as a single element, in order to demonstrate the potential application<br>for space limited imaging systems, two individual objectives with focusing<br>and zoom function integrated with this type of lens were designed. The systems<br>are realized on an optical platform, resulting in a highly compact optical system.<br>The focusing system is able to image the object placed at different distances ranging<br>from 5mm to infinity. The highly compact zoom system with the thickness of<br>6.5mm can continuously shift the focal length from 4.5mm to 9 mm, yielding a 2<br>times magnification",

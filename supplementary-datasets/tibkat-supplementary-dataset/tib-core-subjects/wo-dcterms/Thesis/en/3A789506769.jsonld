            "abstract": "For the first time the transcriptional reprogramming of distinct root cortex cells during the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis was investigated by combining Laser Capture Mirodissection and Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae Medicago genome array hybridization. The establishment of cryosections facilitated the isolation of high quality RNA in sufficient amounts from three different cortical cell types. The transcript profiles of arbuscule-containing cells (arb cells), non-arbuscule-containing cells (nac cells) of Rhizophagus irregularis inoculated Medicago truncatula roots and cortex cells of non-inoculated roots (cor) were successfully explored. The data gave new insights in the symbiosis-related cellular reorganization processes and indicated that already nac cells seem to be prepared for the upcoming fungal colonization. The mycorrhizal- and phosphate-dependent transcription of a GRAS TF family member (MtGras8) was detected in arb cells and mycorrhizal roots. MtGRAS shares a high sequence similarity to a GRAS TF suggested to be involved in the fungal colonization processes (MtRAM1). The function of MtGras8 was unraveled upon RNA interference- (RNAi-) mediated gene silencing. An AM symbiosis-dependent expression of a RNAi construct (MtPt4pro::gras8-RNAi) revealed a successful gene silencing of MtGras8 leading to a reduced arbuscule abundance and a higher proportion of deformed arbuscules in root with reduced transcript levels. Accordingly, MtGras8 might control the arbuscule development and life-time. The targeting of MtGras8 by the phosphate-dependent regulated miRNA5204* was discovered previously (Devers et al., 2011). Since miRNA5204* is known to be affected by phosphate, the posttranscriptional regulation might represent a link between phosphate signaling and arbuscule development. In this work, the posttranscriptional regulation was confirmed by mis-expression of miRNA5204* in M. truncatula roots. The miRNA-mediated gene silencing affects the MtGras8 transcript abundance only in the first two weeks of the AM symbiosis and the mis-expression lines seem to mimic the phenotype of MtGras8-RNAi lines. Additionally, MtGRAS8 seems to form heterodimers with NSP2 and RAM1, which are known to be key regulators of the fungal colonization process (Hirsch et al., 2009; Gobbato et al., 2012). These data indicate that MtGras8 and miRNA5204* are linked to the sym pathway and regulate the arbuscule development in phosphate-dependent manner.",

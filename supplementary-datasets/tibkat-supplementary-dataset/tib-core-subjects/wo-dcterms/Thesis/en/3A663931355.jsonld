            "abstract": "Parkinson\u015b disease (PD) is a progressive neuropathological disorder that is characterized by the presence of intra-cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy Bodies (LBs). LBs represent insoluble protein aggregates with \u00e1-Synuclein (\u00e1S) as a major component. LBs also mark lesions found in a range of related disorders, collectively referred to as synucleinopathies. Recent studies suggest that pathogenesis could result from small pre-fibrillar intermediates of the aggregation pathway, i.e. soluble oligomers of misfolded \u00e1-Synuclein. So, it is not decided yet whether the soluble oligomers or the final products of the \u00e1S aggregation (i.e. the \u00e1S fibrils) are cause of the disease, meaning that the nature of pathogenic \u00e1S species is still unresolved. To understand the nature of pathogenic \u00e1S species and to investigate whether accumulation of soluble pre-fibrillar oligomers of \u00e1S is responsible for the increased neurotoxicity in PD, I have used rationally designed structural variants of \u00e1S with different aggregation properties and tested their biological properties in Drosophila melanogaster, which lacks an \u00e1S gene in the wild type genome. Two of the designed variants, TP-\u00e1S and A56P-\u00e1S, have a remarkably decreased propensity to aggregate, and they form more pre-fibrillar soluble oligomeric species in aggregation assays in vitro ...",

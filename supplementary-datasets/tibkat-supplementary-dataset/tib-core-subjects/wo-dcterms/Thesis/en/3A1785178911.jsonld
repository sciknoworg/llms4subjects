            "abstract": "In the treatment of tumors multimodal treatment settings consisting of surgery, radio(chemo)therapy and immune therapies such as CAR-T cells or immune checkpoint inhibitors are increasingly exploited. In this context, the immune phenotype of tumor cells has a major impact on the anti-tumor immune response as well as on the composition of the tumor microenvironment. A promising approach to further enhance anti-tumor immune response is the additional use of hyperthermia (HT), i.e., heating the tumor tissue to supraphysiologic temperatures between 39 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C for mostly 60 min. A key technique is the use of radiative hyperthermia systems in the frequency range from 13.56 MHz to 2.45 GHz. However, little is known about the extent to which the heating method used in hyperthermia affects the immunophenotype of treated tumor cells, and whether possible differences between conventional warm-water and radiative hyperthermia can be attributed to thermal effects alone or also to non-thermal effects. In the present work, a lab system with closed fluid loop and modular heating units, i.e., warm-water bath heating (CH) or microwave heating (MH) at 915 MHz or 2.45 GHz, was set up to study ex vivo effects of HT under sterile and reproducible conditions. One prerequisite was that fluid circulation alone does not affect the cells. In addition, all heating units and system variations had identical (total) volumes, covered the target temperature range between 37 \u00b0C and 48 \u00b0C, and allowed tissue-like flow rates between 2 ml/s and 5 ml/s. Experiments were carried out and procedural methods were applied to determine flow conditions and axial diffusion. Additionally, the thermal conditions were investigated not only by temperature measurements at the inlet and outlet, but also by numerical simulations, using the commercial program COMSOL\u00ae Multiphysics\u2122. The microwave heating unit for 915 MHz was developed computer-based. Simulations allowed a detailed insight into heating procedures and revealed similarities and differences. For ...",

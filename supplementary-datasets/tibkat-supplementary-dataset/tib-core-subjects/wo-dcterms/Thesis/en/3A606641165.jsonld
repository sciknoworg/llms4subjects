            "abstract": "GRACE, ocean bottom pressure, finite elements, ocean mass variability, bottom pressure recorder. - The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provides estimates of the Earth's time-variable and static gravity field with an unprecedented accuracy. As fluctuations of the gravity field on sub-annual time scales are mainly induced by mass redistribution on the Earth's surface, GRACE is potentially able to monitor oceanic mass variability and redistribution. Current gravity data products, however, suffer from aliasing effects due to insufficient accuracy of background models. This study compares different filter mechanisms and develops a new filtering approach which uses information on ocean circulation patterns derived from model simulations with the Finite Element Sea - Ice Ocean Model (FESOM). To obtain a realistic representation of the ocean mass budget on interannual time scales in the FESOM model, the computation of sea surface height is extended in order to consider the effect of surface freshwater fluxes and internal mixing. The river runoff forcing is modified to balance the net evaporation on long time scales. For validation, we utilize in-situ ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from a global bottom pressure data base. For the correction of tides, variations derived from the tidal model (FES2004), also used as a background model in the GRACE data processing, are subtracted from the in-situ data. In general, the validation of GRACE-derived anomalies against in-situ time series indicates a good agreement between the two data sets. Especially, for the high latitude arrays GRACE captures ...",

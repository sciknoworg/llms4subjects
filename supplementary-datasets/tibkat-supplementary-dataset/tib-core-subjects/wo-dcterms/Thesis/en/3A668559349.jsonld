            "title": "Exosomes act as molecular vehicles contributing to cellular cholesterol efflux",
            "abstract": "Exosomes are small vesicles of 50-100 nm diameter that derive from intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and are secreted into the extracellular environment upon fusion of multiversicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. Release of exosomes is reported for a variety of cell types and serves numerous functions including the shuttle of RNA, proteins and lipids for cell-to-cell communication, antigen presentation, and disposal of obsolete or superuous molecules. Exosomes display a cell type-specific lipid composition, for example those released by B lymphocytes are enriched in cholesterol. Since a tight regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is indispensable for the structural and functional integrity of each cell, we asked whether exosomes contribute to this process by facilitating cholesterol egress. This study shows that generation and release of exosomes is regulated by cellular cholesterol levels. While exosome release was decreased after methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol depletion of oligodendroglial cells, loading of cholesterol led to its increase. It is further demonstrated that flotillin-2, a membrane associated protein enriched in exosomes, is impaired in its exosomal secretion after mutating its putative cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) sequences. SiRNA-mediated down-regulation of flotillin-2 significantly reduced exosomal cholesterol release, highlighting flotillin's importance for cholesterol trafficking. Translocation of cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes to the ER and Golgi compartments has previously been shown to depend on NPC1 and NPC2 proteins ...",

            "abstract": "Research indicates that SES is relevant for students\u2019 educational decisions and outcomes and that people\u2019s justice perceptions are important for their performance and behavior. However, in Germany, the role of SES has received little attention in the area of higher education. In addition, justice perceptions are often not considered in higher educational contexts. The current dissertation tried to fill both voids\u2014by seeking to extend the knowledge and understanding of the roles of students\u2019 SES and students\u2019 justice perceptions in social science study programs. The first study in this dissertation addressed the question of whether first-semester social science students\u2019 objective SES would be related to the characteristics students brought to their study programs. The second study addressed the questions of whether psychology students\u2019 objective SES would predict their academic achievement and whether psychology students\u2019 subjective SES would explain additional variance beyond objective SES. In addition, different measures of subjective SES were investigated. The third study addressed the question of whether psychology students\u2019 justice perceptions could be assessed with a questionnaire that originated in organizational psychology. In addition, associations between students\u2019 justice perceptions and student characteristics were investigated. The main results of the studies revealed that objective SES was associated with only some of the characteristics students brought to their studies (e.g., school grades, number of hours spent working side jobs) but not others (e.g., intelligence). In addition, objective SES and most measures of subjective SES did not predict psychology students\u2019 academic achievement\u2014with the exception of a trinity of measures of subjective SES that disentangled classical aspects of SES and that were adapted to higher education. Finally, to a large extent, it appears to be possible to assess students\u2019 justice perceptions with a questionnaire from organizational psychology. These and additional findings are discussed and placed in a broader context, recommendations for future research are derived, and conclusions are drawn.",

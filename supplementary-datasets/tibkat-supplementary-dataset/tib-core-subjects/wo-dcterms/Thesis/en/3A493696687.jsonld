            "abstract": "This paper presents an automatic approach for segmentation of the liver from computer tomography (CT) images based on a 3D statistical shape model. Segmentation of the liver is an important prerequisite in liver surgery planning. One of the major challenges in building a 3D shape model from a training set of segmented instances of an object is the determination of the correspondence between different surfaces. We propose to use a geometric approach that is based on minimizing the distortion of the correspondence mapping between two different surfaces. For the adaption of the shape model to the image data a profile model based on the grey value appearance of the liver and its surrounding tissues in contrast enhanced CT data was developed. The robustness of this method results from a previous nonlinear diffusion filtering of the image data. Special focus is turned to the quantitative evaluation of the segmentation process. Several different error measures are discussed and implemented in a study involving more than 30 livers.",

            "abstract": "The past decades have witnessed the development of new pharmaceutical compounds that modulate receptor function by targeting allosteric sites. Allosteric sites are, by definition, domains topographically distinct from the orthosteric binding pocket where the natural ligand binds. Exploring the possibilities of linking orthosteric and allosteric pharmacophores in one compound to yield 'bitopic' compounds is a strategy derived from the message-address\" concept by Schwyzer , first applied to GPCRs by Portoghese et al. This concept explicitly underlines the orthosteric/allosteric combination, in opposite to the more general umbrella term bivalent. The broad possibilities of bitopic ligands in the pharmaceutical field are under continuous study. Bitopic compounds are promising pharmaceutical tools for taking advantage of the allosteric binding to achieve subtype selectivity while preserving high affinity at the receptor. The development of bitopic ligands, based on the idea of combining high affinity (via orthosteric sites) with high selectivity (via allosteric sites), have led to the development of highly selective bivalent ligands for GPCRs , such as for the opioid receptors , muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), serotonin receptors, cannabinoid receptors, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors. This concept has even been extended to other receptors, for examples nicotinic receptors and other proteins, such as acetylcholinesterases and the tyrosine kinase receptors TrkA and TrkC. The reasons to pursue a bitopic ligand approach are various. An improved affinity for the target GPCR and/or an improved selectivity either at the level of receptor subtype, or at the level of signaling pathway. Another advantage of bitopic ligands over purely allosteric ligands is that the former rely on the appropriate presence of endogenous agonist tone to mediate their effects, whereas a bitopic ligand would engage the orthosteric site irrespective of the presence or absence of endogenous tone. By way of introduction to the hybrid approach, a review of the concept of hybrids compounds targeting the cholinergic system is presented in section A of this thesis. Recent updates in hybrid molecule design as a strategy for selectively addressing multiple target proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is here reported . This represents the potential and the growing interest in hybrid compound as pharmacological tools to achieve receptor subtype selectivity and/or, to study the overall functional activity of the receptor. Until now, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have proved to be a particularly fruitful receptor model for the development and characterization of bitopic ligands. In this thesis, several examples of new muscarinic bitopic approach are reported in the results section. A study of bipharmacophoric ligands composed of the muscarinic positive allosteric modulators (BQCAderived compounds) linked with chain of various lengths to different orthosteric building blocks is reported in the result part 1. Synthesis and examination of the potential pharmacological characteristic of Oxotremorine-BQCAd compounds and Xanomeline-BQCAd hybrid derivatives are described in results parts 2 and 4, respectively. Moreover, the bitopic concept has even been extended to other proteins, such as acetylcholinesterase. In the result part 5 an overview of the new Tacrine-Xanomeline hybrids aiming to improve the inhibitory potency of the acetylcholinesterase and simultaneously to increase the cholinergic tone, via the xanomelinic portion acting on the M1 receptor is given. A new trivalent approach is presented for the first time to deepen the study of the M1 muscarinic receptor in the result part 6. Moreover, the synthesis of a new series of iperoxo-derived alkane, bis(ammonio)alkane-type and rigidified chain ligands is given in the result part 7 together with some prospects for further research.",

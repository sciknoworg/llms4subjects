            "abstract": "The thesis deals with the problem of optimal consumption under uncertainty. Here, we distinguish uncertainty and risk. Risk denotes the fact that the future development of the stock market is random but the investor knows which future scenarios are possible and knows their probabilities - the so-called market measure. In contrast to this we denote by uncertainty the fact that market participants usually do not know the market measure or at least not exactly. There exists extensive economic literature on the modeling of such a decision problem. In this thesis the agent optimizes his consumption and investment strategy with respect to a robust utility functional. We investigate the investment problem in a general semimartingale market. The agent can invest an initial capital and a random endowment. To find a solution to the investment problem we use the so-called martingale method. We prove that under appropriate assumptions a unique solution to the investment problem exists and describe it. A further result is that primal and dual problem are convex conjugate functions ...",

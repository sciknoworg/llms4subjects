            "abstract": "Stress facilitates the development of psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals. Previous studies have well documented the impact of stress on glutamatergic excitatory transmission in limbic brain regions, but little is known about stress effects on the GABAergic network. The aims of the present thesis were 1) to investigate effects of acute as well as chronic restraint stress on activities of interneurons in the hippocampal formation and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of adult male rats; and 2) to identify the neurophysiological mechanisms which may contribute to potential pathogenetic processes of chronic stress. In the first part of this thesis, effects of stress and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) on hippocampal GABAergic transmission and network function were studied, focusing on two perisomatic interneurons, the parvalbumin (PV) and the cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons. Whole-cell voltage clamping of CA1 pyramidal neurons of acute hippocampal slices revealed a rapid increase of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) following bath application of the potent glucocorticoid receptor agonist DEX. This effect of DEX was mediated by a nongenomic glucocorticoid receptor which evoked nitric oxide (NO) release from pyramidal neurons. Retrograde NO signaling caused the augmentation of GABA release from the interneurons and additionally increased CCK release from CCK interneurons which in turn further enhanced the activity of the PV interneurons ...",

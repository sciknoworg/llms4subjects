                "Flow-experience is widely understood as a source of creativity and innovation, physical and mental peak performances, and well-being. The flow-experience is defined as the optimal experience of a person performing an activity. The aim of this dissertation is to measure flow-experience implicit, mobil and processoriented while walking and running. Running apps serve as an application context, in which flow-experience as a measure of well-being, should complement the performance-related metrics such as distance traveled, calories burned, etc. Thereby it should create the foundation to develop run apps that improve the conditions of experiencing flow while running. The present work gives a description of the search for a valid implicit measurement method of flow-experience that allows process-oriented real-time processing and can be implemented on a smartphone with additional technical equipment. The dissertation introduces candidates for an implicit measurement method of flow-experience and presents three studies with runners and walking people, in which relationships between these potential candidates and explicit features of the flow-experience measured by the flow-short-scale, were tested. The present work proves significant relationships between flow-experience and two of the candidates while running and offers several starting points for further research.",

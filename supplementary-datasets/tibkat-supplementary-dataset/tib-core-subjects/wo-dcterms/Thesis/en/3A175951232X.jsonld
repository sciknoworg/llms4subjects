            "title": "An Examination of Demographic Differences in Obtaining Investment and Financial Planning Information",
            "abstract": "Financial literacy and financial education are important components of modern life. The importance of financial literacy is increasing for financial consumers because of the weakening of both government and employer-based retirement systems. Unfortunately, empirical research shows that financial consumers are not fully informed and are not able to make proper choices even when appropriate information is available. More research is needed as to how financial consumers obtain investment and financial planning information. A primary data study was conducted to understand the differences between the demographic categories of gender, age, education-level, and income-level with the means of obtaining investment and financial planning information. In this research study, which selected a population from the LinkedIn platform, statistical differences between gender, age, education-level, and income-level were confirmed. These differences helped to confirm prior research in this field of study. Practical opportunities for commercial outreach to specific populations became evident through this type of research. Providers of investment and financial planning information can access their targeted audience more effectively by understanding the demographic profile of the audience, as well as the propensity of the demographic profile of the audience to respond. As this type of research is relatively easy to construct and administer, commercial outreach for providers of investment and financial planning information can be conducted in a cost-efficient and effective manner",

                "The search for novel phenomena that exceeds and interconnects our existing knowledge is at the heart of every scientific effort. Physics, and particularly solid-state research, is no exception. If anything, the technological advancements of the last decades have made the need for new concepts even more apparent. A prototypical example here is the beginningbreakdown of Moore\u2019s law in the semiconductor industry, where electronic components shrunk down to a few nanometres in size. This greatly enhanced the performance of, e.g., integrated circuits, but leads to a dead end since the further shrinking of structures is inhibited by their instability on a nanoscale [1], [2]. Such an issue cannot be solved by engineering efforts alone since it is the very physics that blocks the way. In the foreseeable future, disruptive technological advancement will rely on new physical concepts as a basis, and current efforts in solid-state physics research reflect this, as considerable resources are assigned to the studyof phenomena that are yet described as \u201cexotic\u201d. One of such novel phenomena is the existence of non-trivial topological phases of matter. Theoretically proposed by Haldane in 1988 [3], [4], the concept of topology lied mostly dormant until 2007, when K\u00f6nig et al. identified HgTe quantum wells as the first real world system with non-trivial topology [5], [6]. Besides the interesting implications for fundamental research, the emergence of the so-called bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) from non-trivial topology initiated an ever-growing research field within the physics community. The BBC enforces a conductive channel at the interface between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial material, in which electron backscattering is prohibited [3]\u2013[8], yielding robust metallic conductanceindependently of defects and local structural instabilities. This potentially opens a pathway for completely new concepts in (micro-) electronics.To this day, all experimentally confirmed topologically non-trivial materials either have an exceedingly small bulk band gap [9], rendering them uninteresting for technological applications since a substantial share of the overall electric current would flow though the bulk, diminishing the advantages of the topologically protected interface conductance, or exhibit microscopic sample sizes like bismuthene on SiC substrates [10]. Additionally, all experimentally found topological insulators are band-insulators [9], [11]. The honeycomb transition metal oxide sodium iridate (Na2IrO3) is a promising material in this context, as it exhibits a band gap (Mott gap) comparable to the band gaps of common semiconductors and a rich variety of proposed and experimentally reported electronic and magnetic properties [12]\u2013[20]. Among the anticipated properties is the emergence of a non trivial topological phase, which was first proposed in 2009 [21]. This prediction was reinforced 2several times, with the latest according work being published in 2019 [22]\u2013[25]. The Mott gaparises from concurrent crystal field splitting, spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard repulsionapparent on similar energy scales in the material, making Na2IrO3 a strongly correlated Mottinsulator. Non-trivial topology would render Na2IrO3 to be the first topological insulator with a large energy gap as well as the first strongly correlated topological insulator. Combined with sample diameters of up to 1 cm, the material would be interesting for technological application.Yet, after more than a decade of research, the experimental findings on the Na2IrO3 electronic structure are largely incoherent, where even the reported Mott gap size varies between 0.34 eV and 1.2 eV [18], [26]\u2013[29] and the role of the surface with its different terminations is poorly understood.This thesis provides a comprehensive study of the electronic properties of Na2IrO3, focusing on its surface. For this, scanning probe and transport measurements on freshly cleaved samples were performed in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). The new findings yield insights to a variety of disputed properties of Na2IrO3, including the spectral characteristics at the surface and their interpretation in the context of strong electron correlation as well as macroscopic transport properties and the physical picture behind them. Most important, the new results evidence the existence of a highly conductive surface channel as well as states within the Mott gap at the surface.In this work, various physical phenomena apparent in Na2IrO3 are covered, ranging from strong correlation over topology to transport phenomena. To provide a basis for this, a comprehensive introduction to the predicted and examined properties of Na2IrO3 is given in the chapters 2 and 3. Here, chapter 2 focuses on the Na2IrO3 bulk as well as the related Mott physics, whilechapter 3 covers the surface characteristics as well as physical properties associated with topology. Additional physical properties found in experiments that do not arise from the Mottphysics or the surface electronic structure are presented in chapter 4. This is followed in chapter 5 by the presentation of the experimental techniques and sample preparation procedures used in the scope of this thesis. All measurement setups are home-built and new techniques were developed specifically for the work on this thesis. For the two central methods, being scanning tunnelling microscopy and macroscopic transport measurements, an introduction to the relevant theoretical concepts and to applicable transport phenomena is given in chapter 5 as well. The scanning probe results are then presented and discussed in chapter 6. Chapter 7 covers the transport results and their discussion. Finally, a joint discussion on the Na2IrO3 surface electronic structure, incorporating the findings from both methods, is given in chapter 8, before the thesis is concluded with a summary and an outlook.$yLinzenz"

                "This thesis focuses on two classes of cationic phosphines. In the first part, the previously developed cationic pyridinio-phosphines were investigated further in respect to their coordination chemistry towards Ir and their applications in pi-acid catalysis. In the second and major part, a new class of cationic phosphines, the cationic phospholes are introduced. The cationic phospholes were prepared in a concise and scalable synthesis. With four different cationic phospholes in hand, their electronic properties were investigated by means of IR-spectrometry, P-NMR of Se-adducts and cyclic/squarewave voltammetry. Their structural characteristics could be shown by X-ray analysis and buried volume calculations. The reactivity of the prepared compounds in oxidations and Diels-Alder reactions could be shown, as well as their coordination chemistry towards Au(I). From the synthesized Au-complexes, three were tested in catalysis, where they showed high reactivity and selectivity in the tested hydroarylation- and cyclisation-reactions.$yLinzenz",

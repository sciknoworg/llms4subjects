                "The automotive industry is undergoing a profound change. According to the researches done by this work, it is obvious that such a situation has a decisive influence not only on the scope and the form of the knowledge, which should be available to the involved participants in the automotive industry even in an ideal way, but also on the way in which relevant knowledge is exchanged among these participants. In the end, there is a loss of know-how in the process of the generation and transfer of knowledge for the after-sales service under the changed conditions and structures in the automotive industry and in the automotive aftermarket. This loss of know-how is amplified because of few user-friendly alignments by the groups of these participants or these individual participants, for which the technology-centric behavior of research and development engineers is just an example in this work. Furthermore, this work is also devoted to the question of the future form of knowledge management for securing the know-how for the automotive service.",

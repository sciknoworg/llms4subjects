                "Microvascular Decompression represents an effective treatment for hemifacial spasm. The use of lateral spread responses (LSRs) monitoring remains a useful intraoperative tool to ensure adequate decompression of the facial nerve. Objective: To assess the value of LSRs intraoperative monitoring as a prognostic indicator for the outcome of microvascular decompression in hemifacial spasm. Methods: Our study included 100 patients prospectively. The patients were classified into 4 groups whether LSRs were totally, partially, not relieved or not detected from the start. According to clinical outcome, the patients were classified into 4 groups depending on the clinical course after surgery and the residual symptoms if any. Then, correlations were made between LSRs events and treatment outcome to detect its reliability as a prognostic indicator. Results: LSRs were relieved totally in 56% of the patients, partially relieved in 14%, not relieved in 10% and were not detected in 20% of the patients from the start. HFS was relieved directly after operation in 62% with clinical improvement of 90-100%. 31% described 50-90% improvement over the next 3 months after surgery. Almost all of these 31% (28 out of 31 patients) reported further clinical improvement of 90-100% within one year after surgery. 3% suffered from a relapse after a HFS-free period and 4% reported minimal or no improvement describing 0-50% of the preoperative state. The percentage of the satisfied patients with the clinical ...",

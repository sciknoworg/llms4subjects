            "title": "Synaptic targeting of neurotransmitter receptors is regulated by neurobeachin",
            "abstract": "In neuronal network, information is transferred mainly via chemical synapses. Typically, a neuron receives thousands of inputs, which are transmitted by the activation of a large number of receptors present at postsynapses. Therefore, the functional integrity of synapses is tightly dependent on the localization and function of postsynaptic receptors. The receptor transport, anchoring, and turnover at postsynaptic sites all contribute to synaptic strength and are controlled by multiple trafficking, sorting, motor, and scaffolding proteins. In this study, Neurobeachin (Nbea), a neuron specific BEACH domain protein, was identified as a novel essential regulator of the trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors to postsynapses. The deletion of Nbea leads to a reduction in GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission due to reduced surface expression of GABAA and glutamate receptors. AMPA- type glutamate receptors are trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus of the Nbea KO neurons, and kainate, NMDA, and GABAA receptors do not reach the synapses in Nbea KO neurons. However, the total expression levels of pre- and postsynaptic proteins, the maturation and surface expression of membrane proteins, as well as presynaptic function and synapse formation are unperturbed upon Nbea loss. Thus, under resting conditions Nbea organizes the synaptic delivery of neurotransmitter receptors directly from the endoplasmic reticulum to synapses and thereby exerts a major influence on synaptic transmission ...",

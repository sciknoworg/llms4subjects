            "title": "Calcium hydroxide as antibacterial implant coating",
            "abstract": "In modern medicine hip and knee joint replacement are common surgical procedures. However, about 11 % of hip implants and about 7 % of knee implants need re-operations. The comparison of implant registers revealed two major indications for re-operations: aseptic loosening and implant infections, that both severely impact the patients' health and are an economic burden for the health care system. To address these problems, a calcium hydroxide coating on titanium was investigated in this thesis. Calcium hydroxide is a well-known antibacterial agent and used with success in dentistry. The coatings were applied with electrochemically assisted deposition, a versatile tool that combines easiness of process with the ability to coat complex geometries homogeneously. The pH-gradient during coating was investigated and showed the surface confinement of the coating process. Surface pre-treatment altered the surface morphology and chemistry of the titanium substrates and was shown to affect the morphology of the calcium hydroxide coatings. The influence of the coating parameters stirring speed and current pulsing were examined in various configurations and combinations and could also affect the surface morphology. A change in surface morphology results in a changed adhesion and behavior of cells and bacteria. Thus, the parameters surface pre-treatment, stirring speed and current pulsing presented a toolset for tailoring cellular response and antibacterial properties. Microbiological tests with S. aureus and S. epidermidis were performed to test the time-dependent antibacterial activity of the calcium hydroxide coatings. A reduction of both strains could be achieved for 13 h, which makes calcium hydroxide a promising antibacterial coating. To give insight into biofilm growth, a protocol for biofilm staining was investigated on titanium disks with S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Biofilm growth could be detected after 5 days of bacterial incubation, which was much earlier than the 3 weeks that are currently assumed in medical ...",

                "STEM-Subjects, IRIS, Interests and Recruitment in Science, choice of studies, study continuance, study dropout.",
                "International studies have shown, that only a few young people choose to study within the field of the so-called STEM-subjects of mathematics, computer science, natural sciences and technology. (Jacob & Simpkins 2006; National Science Board, 2006 EU, 2004). To create and obtain a sustainable, knowledge-based economy in a modern society, well-educated men and especially more women in STEM-subjects are essential (EU, 2004). Based on these facts, the present thesis aims to investigate the factors influencing the choice of studies, the continuance in these studies and the dropout of these at Austrian universities. Measures, which make STEM fields of study more attractive to young people, will be identified. Based on the Expectancy - Value Model of Achievement - related Choices (Eccles et al, 1983;. Eccles & Wigfield, 2002), Tinto's model of student retention (Tinto, 1993) and the selfefficacy theory by Bandura (1997) an own research model has been developed. The data is generated in a large-scale questionnaire survey, in which 1336 STEM-students at Austrian universities, in their second semester (women N = 668, men N = 668), participated. The respondents are selected by means of predefined fields of ISCED code assigned studies. In addition to the questionnaire survey, qualitative interviews are conducted at three different times of measurement. Subjects are exclusively female students of studies of Biology Bachelor and Biology with teaching option (first interview series NB = 9, NL = 9; second interview series NB = 8, NL = 6; third interview series NB = 2, NL = 2). The choice of study pathways, continuance in these studies and the dropout of STEM students are influenced by a multitude of factors."

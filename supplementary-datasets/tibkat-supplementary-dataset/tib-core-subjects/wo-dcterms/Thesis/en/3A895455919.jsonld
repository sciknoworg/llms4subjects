            "abstract": "High spatial resolution (HSR) multispectral and object height data are becoming increasingly available in the urbanized regions of the world. The synergistic utilization of these data sources holds a large potential for the fine-scale characterization of a city because they are of high descriptive power and non-redundant. However, despite this promising development, detailed and area-wide maps of important settlement parameters, like land cover (LC), urban site characteristics (USCs), and urban structure types (USTs), are still lacking in many municipalities. One reason for this observation is the methodological challenge of turning the wealth of geospatial data into reliable thematic information. Accordingly, there is a strong need for accurate and transferable software solutions being able to produce some of the key data sets for human settlement monitoring from HSR multispectral and object height data. The present work aims at addressing this need. The overall goal of the dissertation was to develop methods for the fusion of HSR multispectral and object height data as well as to showcase their utility in the context of different urban environmental mapping and monitoring applications. It therefore intended to make both a technical and an applied contribution to the field of urban remote sensing. Particular emphasis was put on mapping urban LC, USCs, and USTs, as well as the usage of USCs to study urban land surface temperature (LST) and the surface urban heat island (UHI) effect. These settlement parameters were chosen because they are thematically connected, difficult to obtain from other data sources, and of high relevance for urban planning. To meet the above goal, a comprehensive literature review was conducted in advance. The review helped identifying current deficits within the chosen research fields and led to the formulation of specific thesis objectives. The latter determined the practical agenda of this work, comprising an overall number of four studies.",

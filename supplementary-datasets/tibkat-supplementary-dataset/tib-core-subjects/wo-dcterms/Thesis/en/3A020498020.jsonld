            "abstract": "\"Northeim is a town on the Leine River situated in the hilly region of Lower Saxony between Hildesheim and G\u00f6ttingen; to historians it is known as the location of William Sheridan Allen\u2019s path-breaking study of the Nazi Machtergreifung. The book was based on a 1962 dissertation at the University of Minnesota, and Allen first published it while at the University of Missouri in Columbia in 1965. Within two years, it appeared in England and was translated into German and French. Allen had settled at the State University of New York in Buffalo by the time I read the second, revised edition (New York 1984), which I used to write this review. In the forty years since its publication, Allen\u2019s readable history became a standard for undergraduates in North America; and his microhistory of the Machtergreifung has been replicated in most German localities. A number of American scholars in particular have followed in Allen\u2019s footsteps: Peter Fritzsche, David Imhoof, Rudy Koshar, and others, including myself. Part of the reason for the interest of American doctoral students in German Mittelst\u00e4dte is, of course, pragmatic. When one has limited time and money for a research trip abroad, it seems reasonable to select for study an \u2018\u00fcberschaubare\u2019 provincial town. The peculiarities of American culture is surely another reason that historians from the United States look for the German equivalent of \u2018middle America\u2019 in what Mack Walker called \u2018German home towns\u2019. But in the end, German historians from many countries, including Germany, have adopted Allen\u2019s method because close investigations of events \u2018on the ground\u2019 offer a necessary balance to modern German histories \u2018writ large\u2019.\" (Abstract)",

            "abstract": "Short-term plasticity is a fundamental property of all synapses but its underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, the functional role of the well-known second messenger, cAMP, was studied at the calyx of Held synapse, a giant glutamatergic synapse in the auditory brainstem. By combining electrophysiological recordings of the pre- and postsynaptic compartments with Ca2+ imaging and Ca2+ uncaging, it was found that elevation of cAMP concentration increased intracellular Ca2+ sensitivity for transmitter release, especially at lower Ca2+ concentrations. The change in Ca2+ sensitivity was limited to the fast-releasing synaptic vesicles, but not the slowly-releasing vesicles. Fitting of the data using a simplified allosteric model indicated that cAMP increased the fusion 'willingness', thereby facilitating transmitter release. It was suggested that synaptic vesicles have to be positionally primed to the release sites close to the Ca2+ channel cluster for cAMP to modulate intracellular Ca2+ sensitivity. In addition to exocytosis, I have used time-resolved capacitance measurement to examine whether cAMP modulates endocytosis. It was found that lowering the concentration of cAMP in the terminal as well as inhibition of PKA activity slowed down the rate of endocytosis during strong stimulation ...",

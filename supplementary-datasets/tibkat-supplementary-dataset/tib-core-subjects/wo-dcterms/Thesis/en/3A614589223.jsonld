            "abstract": "Theoretically, to fully describe the change in the medium around a point one needs three components of translation, six components of strain, and three components of rotation. It is expected that collocated measurements of translations and rotations may help (1) correcting translation signals recorded by classical seismometers for contamination by ground rotations, (2) extracting additional information on earthquake source properties, soil-structure interactions, and properties of the subsurface, and (3) providing additional ground motion information to earthquake engineers for seismic design. Thus, in addition to translations and strains, the rotational part of ground motions should also be recorded. However, the lack of instrumental sensitivity did not allow seismologists to observe rotational motions for decades. Recently, ring laser technology has provided the means to develop instruments that allow in principle the observation of rotational motions in a wide frequency band and epicentral distance range. Here we present the observations of rotational ground motions around a vertical axis in the P coda (the section between the onsets of direct P- and S- waves) of tele-seismic signals on a ring laser sensor at the Fundamental Observatory Wettzell, southeast Germany. The studies focus on finding the explanation for the observed P coda rotations as well ...",

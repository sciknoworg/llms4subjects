            "abstract": "Standard freeze-drying processes pose several challenges to the pharmaceutical industry. For example, the random nature of ice nucleation during conventional freezing by shelf temperature cooling ramps can result in pronounced differences in pore morphology and drying behavior within one batch and during the transfer and scale-up of freeze-drying cycles. Furthermore, recent advances in personalized medicine lead to an increasing need for smaller batch sizes and more manufacturer flexibility concerning the packaging material and changes between packaging formats. Current innovations in process control technologies and packaging material address these challenges but represent deviations from the basic principles of a standard freeze-drying process. Consequently, an effect on process and product is feasible. Equipment manufacturers have introduced several commercially available, controlled ice nucleation technologies into the market. By controlling the degree of supercooling, these technologies can be used to address a major factor of different product behavior during transfer and scale-up of freeze-drying cycles, as well as to provide benefits such as lower product resistances and increased sublimation rates during primary drying. Advances in molded vial manufacturing enabled manufacturers to produce molded vials with an improved homogeneity in the vial wall thickness. Novel packaging materials, such as prepackaged nested vials or polymer caps, allow for easier processing of smaller batch sizes. Knowledge of the effect of these non-standard process control technologies and packaging materials on process development, drying behavior and product quality is essential for their optimal use in pharmaceutical freezedrying. Consequently, this thesis investigates the effect of controlled ice nucleation technologies on freeze-drying process data and product quality attributes. Model systems are subjected to different freezing phase modifications with controlled ice nucleation to provide guidelines for optimally ...",

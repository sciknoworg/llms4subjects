            "abstract": "The thesis attempts to identify social mechanisms that connect different forms of resentment \u2013 intolerance towards social minorities, anti-democratic views, electoral radical right-wing support \u2013 to (changes in) the social and demographic structure of society, economic conditions, policies, and party politics set against the specific historic backgrounds of European countries. \u201cRadical Right-Wing Support among Urban Voters\u201d investigates how immigration into cities \u2013 where most immigrants into European countries tend settle \u2013 increases electoral radical right-wing support, in the context of poverty, residential segregation and the history of immigration into neighborhoods. The analysis makes use of unique contextual data on neighborhoods in 34 German cities between the years 2014\u20132017 enriched with election data. \u201cThe Residential Context as Source of Deprivation\u201d investigates the political rural\u2013urban divide in current democracies: In regions exposed to precarious demographic developments \u2013 heavy emigration, aging populations, few children, skewed adult sex ratios \u2013 shops, services, events, and transportation infrastructure thin out, social support systems suffer, and so on, leaving residents feeling disadvantaged. In worldwide comparison, East Germany is more strongly affected by these demographic developments than any other region. The study uses an yearly East-German survey covering the years 2000\u20132014 enriched with regional contextual data to show long-term effects of demographic developments on anti-immigrant and nationalist attitudes as well as on democratic discontent. \u201cDynamics of Immigrant Resentment in Europe\u201d focuses on differences between countries by undertaking the first comprehensive test of all social explanations of immigrant resentment predominant in the research literature across 30 European countries between the years 2002\u20132016, relying on the European Social Survey and comprehensive contextual data.",

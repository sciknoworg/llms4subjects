            "abstract": "The phenomenon of retarded luminescence in alkali halides and rare gas crystals, as well as the experimental possibility of short-time resolved observation of excitonic evolutions in general, leads our attention to the problem of the temporal evolution of coupled exciton-phonon systems. In earlier work on this subject usually a semiclassical approximation was employed, i.e., the phonon system was treated classically, the exciton system quantum mechanically. However, in certain ranges of the system parameters this procedure leads to results that contradict the exact solution even qualitatively. An exact numerical solution, however, is almost impossible, except in the simplest cases. In the present thesis therefore a new method for the calculation of the temporal dynamics of coupled exciton-phonon system is introduced, which is based on unitary transformations. The system is subjected to a tractable, parameterized unitary transformation, where the parameters of the transformation are chosen such that the transformed Hamiltonian becomes as diagonal as possible with respect to a given basis of the state space. The method is demonstrated for the exemplary case of the dimer-oscillator model, the simplest model showing the antagonism between self-trapping and delocalization of the exciton which is characteristic for coupled exciton-phonon systems. The results for the energy eigenvalues and the temporal evolution are compared to the solutions obtained by numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. In summary it can be said that unitary transformations can be used to calculate not only static properties, but also the temporal dynamics of coupled exciton-phonon systems. The next step would be to generalize the method to more complicated systems, such as spatially extended, translatory invariant systems or the 222 model.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions of grasslands has received increasing attention in recent years. Scientists have sought to disentangle this complex relationship by sown biodiversity experiments and observational studies. However, both methods have their advantages and shortcomings. Hence, by using a complementary approach, namely a removal experiment involving manipulation of established vegetation, we might gain new and interesting insight into the effects of biodiversity on productivity and other ecosystem functions. In this study, a removal experiment was set up in the Solling Uplands in 2008 where a permanent grass sward was manipulated by herbicides to obtain either pure grass swards (dicot reduced) or swards with relatively high amounts of forbs and legumes (moncot reduced), on top of untreated control swards. Species numbers were larger than 10/m2 and thus covered the upper part of the usually examined logarithmic scale. They were comparable to average spechies richness on European grassland. The manipulated swards were then examined under different environmental conditions, i.e. we created a gradient in management intensity, regulated by both the cutting regime and the nutrient supply. Three main aspects were investigated. At first, we were interested to see how the herbicide application changed the grass swards and if we could create an appropriate biodiversity gradient on our experimental area ...",

            "abstract": "A point process is a mechanism, which realizes randomly locally finite point measures. One of the main results of this thesis is an existence theorem for a new class of point processes with a so called signed Levy pseudo measure L, which is an extension of the class of infinitely divisible point processes. The construction approach is a combination of the classical point process theory, as developed by Kerstan, Matthes and Mecke, with the method of cluster expansions from statistical mechanics. Here the starting point is a family of signed Radon measures, which defines on the one hand the Levy pseudo measure L, and on the other hand locally the point process. The relation between L and the process is the following: this point process solves the integral cluster equation determined by L. We show that the results from the classical theory of infinitely divisible point processes carry over in a natural way to the larger class of point processes with a signed Levy pseudo measure. In this way we obtain e.g. a criterium for simplicity and a characterization through the cluster equation, interpreted as an integration by parts formula, for such point processes. Our main result in chapter 3 is a representation theorem for the factorial moment measures of the above point processes. With its help we will identify the permanental respective determinantal point processes, which belong to the classes of Boson respective Fermion processes. As a by-product we obtain a representation of the (reduced) Palm kernels of infinitely divisible point processes. In chapter 4 we see how the existence theorem enables us to construct (infinitely extended) Gibbs, quantum-Bose and polymer processes. The so called polymer processes seem to be constructed here for the first time. In the last part of this thesis we prove that the family of cluster equations has certain stability properties with respect to the transformation of its solutions. At first this will be used to show how large the class of solutions of such equations is, and secondly to establish the cluster theorem of Kerstan, Matthes and Mecke in our setting. With its help we are able to enlarge the class of Polya processes to the so called branching Polya processes. The last sections of this work are about thinning and splitting of point processes. One main result is that the classes of Boson and Fermion processes remain closed under thinning. We use the results on thinning to identify a subclass of point processes with a signed Levy pseudo measure as doubly stochastic Poisson processes. We also pose the following question: Assume you observe a realization of a thinned point process. What is the distribution of deleted points? Surprisingly, the Papangelou kernel of the thinning, besides a constant factor, is given by the intensity measure of this conditional probability, called splitting kernel.",

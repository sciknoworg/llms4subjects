            "title": "The contribution of N-terminally modified amyloid beta to the etiology of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease",
            "abstract": "A heterogeneou s mixture of amyloid beta (A\u00df) isoforms exists in the brains of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) patients. Despite decades of research, relatively little is known about the precise contribution of these variousA\u00df species to the development and progression of AD. Recent work has identified pyroglutamate-modified amyloid beta (A\u00df pE) as a particularly abundant and toxic peptide. Transgenic mice designed to specifically overproduceA\u00df pE exhibit neuron loss and behavioral deficits. Unfortunately, general breeding issues and the severe pathology found in these models restrict their use for additional transgenic studies. In the first project of this thesis, the TBA42 mouse model was generated to overcome these problems and further explore the consequences ofA\u00df pE accumulation in vivo. Using immunohistochemistry, it was shown that TBA42 mice develop region-specific intraneuronal and extracellularA\u00df /A\u00df pE deposits accompanied by progressive gliosis. Decreased anxiety and altered rearing behavior were the earliest and most persistent behavioral changes identified in this model. TBA42 mice also displayed age-dependent deficits in motor performance and working memory. The phenotype observed in the TBA42 model is comparable to otherA\u00df pE -generating transgenic mouse lines. However, the moderate pathology and behavioral impairments of TBA42 mice make them suitable for further transgenic experiments ...",

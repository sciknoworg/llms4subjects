            "abstract": "The transcriptional regulation of the cellular mechanisms involves many different components and different levels of control which together contribute to fine tune the response of cells to different environmental stimuli. In some responses, diverse signaling pathways can be controlled simultaneously. One of the most important cellular processes that seem to possess multiple levels of regulation is photosynthesis. A model organism for studying photosynthesis-related processes is the unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, due to advantages related to culturing, genetic manipulation and availability of genome sequence. In the present study, we were interested in understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying photosynthesis-related processes. To achieve this goal different molecular approaches were followed. In order to indentify protein transcriptional regulators we optimized a method for isolation of nuclei and performed nuclear proteome analysis using shotgun proteomics. This analysis permitted us to improve the genome annotation previously published and to discover conserved and enriched protein motifs among the nuclear proteins. In another approach, a quantitative RT-PCR platform was established for the analysis of gene expression of predicted transcription factor (TF) and other transcriptional regulator (TR) coding genes by transcript profiling. The gene expression profiles for more than one hundred genes were monitored in time series experiments under conditions of changes in light intensity (200 \u00b5E m-2 s-1 to 700 \u00b5E m-2 s-1), and changes in concentration of carbon dioxide (5% CO2 to 0.04% CO2). The results indicate that many TF and TR genes are regulated in both environmental conditions and groups of co-regulated genes were found. Our findings also suggest that some genes can be common intermediates of light and carbon responsive regulatory pathways. These approaches together gave us new insights about the regulation of photosynthesis and revealed new candidate regulatory genes, helping to decipher the gene regulatory networks in Chlamydomonas. Further experimental studies are necessary to clarify the function of the candidate regulatory genes and to elucidate how cells coordinately regulate the assimilation of carbon and light responses.",

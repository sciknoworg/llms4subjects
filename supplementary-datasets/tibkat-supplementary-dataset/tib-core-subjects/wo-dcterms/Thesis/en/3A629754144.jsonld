            "title": "Study on a novel thermoelectrical micro-droplet sensor",
            "abstract": "MEMS, thermoelectricity, micro-droplet, micro-sensor. - Due to the limited functionalities and considerable expense of the currently prevailing principles for characterizing tiny drops, Prof. Dr. W. Lang et al. proposed a groundbreaking method through observing the thermal behaviour of a concerned droplet upon its impinging upon a thermoelectric micro-flowmeter. M. Maiwald et al. have experimentally proved the feasibility of this proposal. This submitted thesis exhibits both theoretical explanation of the multi-region multi-phase process and technical aspects of development of a novel thermoelectric micro-droplet sensor. With low Weber numbers (c.a. 11) of the tiny drops, deformation and advancing of droplets are neglected. The final diameter of the meniscus is determined with help of Overall Energy Balance approach. Considering the temperature profile of the underlying membrane, one can mesh the meniscus in slices parallel with the heater, then apply the extended general heat conduction equation to the slice element. Based on the assumptions that the droplet in quiescent atmosphere can be approximated with a spherical cap with base radius $b$ and contact angle $\\alpha$, and the problem is considered as a quasi-steady type, the analysis starts with the energy equation of a differential volume in the vapour mixture above the evaporating splat. The analytic models following two vaporization scenarios are compared with the data acquired by M. Maiwald et al. By introducing the assumptions that the liquid is incompressible and Newtonian, and the role of gravity/gravitation can be ignored, Navier-Stokes equations are applied to the infinitesimal volumes inside the droplet. Solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations gain a more precise insight into deformation and spreading of the droplet. The general heat conduction equation governs the temperature distribution across the liquid and the membrane. As to evaporation, the Clausius-Clapeyron saturation relation can be adopted to calculate the phase transfer. These phenomena are coupled through liquid mass, contact surface, and temperature-dependent parameters. With proper boundary conditions and initial conditions, numerical calculations were carried out, where free surfaces were tracked using Volume of Fluid algorithm together with the Fractional Area/Volume Obstacle Representation method. The confirmed analytic modelling techniques ...",

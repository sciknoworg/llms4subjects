            "abstract": "Addiction, as a chronic and relapsing condition, is defined as a disorder of the brain, characterized by the continuation of drug use despite the knowledge of its negative consequences. Several theoretical models propose a framework for the development and maintenance of addictive behaviors in general. These models address different processes of brain structure and function. First, incentive sensitization theory proposes a disruption of the brain reward network. According to this theory, reward processes are altered in form of a hypersensitivity to drug-associated rewards and a desensitization to non-drug-related rewards. Second, threat and punishment processing may be disrupted in the aversion related brain network in the case of an addictive disorder. Addicted individuals may present a desensitization to aversive drug-related cues as proposed by threat/ punishment desensitization theory. Third, dual systems theory proposes a lack of control\" to resist temptations to take drugs. This lack occurs in form of weaker prefrontal control network activations in response to drug-related cues. The assumptions made by these models are not contradictory, but rather address different aspects of drug-related processes in the brain. In tobacco use disorder (TUD), empirical evidence addressing particularly or simultaneously altered reward, threat/ punishment and cognitive control processes is lacking. As TUD represents one of the most common substance use disorders (SUDs) in general, a better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings could help to inform prevention strategies and improve cessation rates. The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate and integrate hypotheses on neural alterations in TUD. Therefore, alterations in reward, threat and cognitive control processes in TUD subjects compared to never-smokers (NS) and within the group of TUD subjects were investigated in form of: (1) altered reward processing in the brain reward network",

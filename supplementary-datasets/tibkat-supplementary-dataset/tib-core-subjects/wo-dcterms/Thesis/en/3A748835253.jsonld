                "Universities represent the highest level of education, yet they are notoriously slow in responding to a rapidly changing world. Deeply entrenched elitism and routines, a continued emphasis on reproductive learning, and the continued dominance of disciplinary thinking, have, in many instances, created bastions of educational conservatism, unable to contribute meaningfully to the development of people, businesses and communities within a finite global ecosystem.This book focuses on an African university's efforts to become more innovative and responsive to community needs and the challenges posed by sustainability. A central concept is innovation competence as a pre-requisite for transforming learning, research and consultancy. Making change in society requires innovation competences over and above disciplinary expertise and these competences have to be learnt by both staff and students.Kibwika not only shows that it is imperative that African universities re-orient their programmes to produce graduates capable of enhancing innovation and social change in the community, he also provides a number of solid stepping stones for capacity building and curriculum development that, in time, will result in an innovative university able to contribute to a world that is more sustainable than the one currently in prospect"

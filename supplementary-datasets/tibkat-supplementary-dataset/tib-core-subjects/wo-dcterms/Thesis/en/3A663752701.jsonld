            "abstract": "Members of the vertebrate Numb family of cell fate determinants have been shown to play multiple roles throughout early embryogenesis including an essential role during the development of the nervous system. The Numb proteins interact with multiple binding partners and correspondingly exhibit multiple functional activities such as the inhibition of the Notch pathway. However, the molecular mechanism of action during vertebrate development remains unclear. NumbL, but not Numb, is expressed in the areas of primary neurogenesis of Xenopus and is found to be positively regulated by the Neurogenin proneural factors and negatively by Notch. While overexpression of NumbL results in a mild increase in differentiated neurons, the knockdown of NumbL leads to a loss of proneural markers downstream of Neurogenin and increases neural progenitor markers. Furthermore, this thesis work provides evidence that NumbL interacts with the AP-2 complex and that this interaction is required for NumbL function during primary neurogenesis. Interestingly, the inhibition of neurogenesis in the absence of NumbL appears not to be the consequence of an increase in the inhibitory Notch signalling pathway.",

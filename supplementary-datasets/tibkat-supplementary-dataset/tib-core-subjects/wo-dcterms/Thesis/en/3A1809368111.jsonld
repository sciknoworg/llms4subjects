            "abstract": "Optogenetics became successful in neuroscience with Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, as an easy applicable tool. The success of ChR2 inspired the development of various photosensory proteins as powerful actuators for optogenetic manipulation of biological activity. However, the current optogenetic toolbox is still not perfect and further improvements are desirable. In my thesis, I engineered and characterized several different optogenetic tools with new features. (i) Although ChR2 is the most often used optogenetic actuator, its single-channel conductance and its Ca2+ permeability are relatively low. ChR2 variants with increased Ca2+ conductance were described recently but a further increase seemed possible. In addition, the H+ conductance of ChR2 may lead to cellular acidification and unintended pH-related side effects upon prolonged illumination. Through rational design, I developed several improved ChR2 variants with larger photocurrent, higher cation selectivity, and lower H+ conductance. (ii) The light-activated inward chloride pump NpHR is a widely used optogenetic tool for neural silencing. However, pronounced inactivation upon long time illumination constrains its application for long-lasting neural inhibition. I found that the deprotonation of the Schiff base underlies the inactivation of NpHR. Through systematically exploring optimized illumination schemes, I found illumination with blue light alone could profoundly increase the temporal stability of the NpHR-mediated photocurrent. A combination of green and violet light eliminates the inactivation effect, similar to blue light, but leading to a higher photocurrent and therefore better light-induced inhibition. (iii) Photoactivated adenylyl cyclases (PACs) were shown to be useful for light-manipulation of cellular cAMP levels. I developed a convenient in-vitro assay for soluble PACs that allows their reliable characterization. Comparison of different PACs revealed that bPAC from ...",

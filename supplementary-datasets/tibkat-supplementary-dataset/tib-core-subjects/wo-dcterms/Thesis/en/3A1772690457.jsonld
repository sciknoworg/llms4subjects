            "abstract": "Objectives: The experiments were designed to optimize the combinations of 3D-printing parameters for PEEK with a fused filament fabrication (FFF) process and to quantitatively evaluate the quality of 3D printed small parts, with the ultimate objective to 3D print small PEEK parts such as personalized dental implants. Methods: This research was conducted using an experimental FFF 3D printer and PEEK filament. Standard PEEK parts were 3D printed for bending and compression tests. Based on the Box-Behnken design, a three factors based experiment was designed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Nozzle diameter, nozzle temperature and printing speed were involved. The density and dimensional accuracy of these printed parts were evaluated, and the bending and compression tests were conducted. With the optimized parameters, dental implants were printed with the same printing system. Results: The nozzle diameter was found to be the most significant parameter affecting the bending and compression performance of the printed PEEK samples, followed by printing speed and nozzle temperature. The highest accuracy in sample width was obtained with a 0.6 mm nozzle while the most accurate diameter was obtained with a 0.4 mm nozzle. A combination of 0.4 mm nozzle diameter, 430 \u00b0C nozzle temperature and printing speed of 5 mm/s was beneficial to get the densest samples and therefore the best bending strength; reduced internal defects were possible with a 0.2 mm nozzle, a higher nozzle temperature of 440 \u2103 and slower printing speed thus performed better bending modulus. The best compression properties were achieved with 0.6mm nozzles, with relatively low influence of the other parameters. Dental implants printed with 0.15 mm nozzle were achieved in our experiment. Conclusions: Optimal parameter combinations have been found to get the best bending or compression properties. The optimized parameters for better dimension accuracy were also obtained depending on the shape of the specimens. Dental implants made from PEEK were ...",

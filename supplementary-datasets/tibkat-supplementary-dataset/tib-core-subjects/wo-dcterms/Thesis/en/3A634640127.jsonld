            "title": "Efficient multilevel solvers and high performance computing techniques for the finite element simulation of large-scale elasticity problems",
            "abstract": "In the simulation of realistic solid mechanical problems, linear equation systems with hundreds of million unknowns can arise. For the efficient solution of such systems, parallel multilevel methods are mandatory that are able to exploit the capabilities of modern hardware technologies. The finite element and solution toolbox FEAST, which is designed to solve scalar equations, pursues exactly this goal. It combines hardware-oriented implementation techniques with a multilevel domain decomposition method called ScaRC that achieves high numerical and parallel efficiency. In this thesis a concept is developed to solve multivariate elasticity problems based on the FEAST library. The general strategy is to reduce the solution of multivariate problems to the solution of a series of scalar problems. This approach facilitates a strict separation of 'low level' scalar kernel functionalities (in the form of the FEAST library) and 'high level' multivariate application code (in the form of the elasticity problem), which is very attractive from a software-engineering point of view: All efforts to improve hardware-efficiency and adaptations to future technology trends can be restricted to scalar operations, and the multivariate application automatically benefits from these enhancements. In the first part of the thesis, substantial improvements of the scalar ScaRC solvers are developed, which are then used as essential building blocks for the efficient solution of multivariate elasticity problems.",

            "abstract": "The JAK/STAT signalling cascade is one of the most conserved pathways in the animal kingdom. Aside from its developmental roles, the JAK/STAT pathway is needed for stem cell maintenance, and its mis-regulation is associated with various malignancies, ranging from solid tumours to myeloproliferative disorders. Using Drosophila as a genetically tractable model organism has enabled the identification of the main JAK/STAT pathway components. This work was aimed at identifying downstream effectors of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway which are be responsible for the generation and progression of blood tumours. Gene expression profiling identified 1197 loci that are regulated either directly or indirectly at different time points by the main pathway ligand UPD. Bioinformatic analysis of the 1197 genes showed a temporally dynamic distribution of functional categories relevant to immunity. Furthermore promoter analysis illustrated differential distribution of high and low affinity binding sites of the JAK/STAT pathway transcription factor among up-regulated genes. The significance of ten UPD-regulated genes in mediating tumourigenesis in flies was also validated in vivo. Among these are genes that are important in cell polarity, a function that has recently emerged as being important for polarised JAK/STAT signalling in epithelial cells ...",

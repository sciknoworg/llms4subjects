            "abstract": "The human specific gram-negative bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (Nme, meningococci) is a common colonizer of the upper respiratory tract. Upon becoming invasive, Nme can cause meningitis and life-threatening sepsis. The most important immune defense mechanism in invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is the complement mediated killing of bacteria. The complement cascade is activated through different pathogen associated patterns and finally leads to the lysis of the bacteria by the membrane attack complex. In addition to the direct bacterial killing, the complement system is also an important player in different inflammatory processes. A hallmark of IMD is an overreaction of the immune system and the release of the potent anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a by the complement system is an important factor hereby. There are three anaphylatoxin receptors (ATRs), the C3aR, the C5aR1 and the C5aR2, capable of detecting these anaphylatoxins. It has already been shown that blocking the ATR C5aR1 strongly benefitted the outcome of IMD in a murine sepsis model. However, the roles of ATRs C3aR and C5aR2 in IMD are still unclear. This work aims to analyze the role of these ATRs in meningococcal sepsis and to identify possible underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, a possible involvement of the complement system, the ATRs and the type II CRISPR/Cas system on nasopharyngeal colonization is analyzed. In vivo depletion experiments showed that without neutrophils or monocytes/macrophages the complement system alone was not able to clear a low dose Nme infection, which highlights the importance of cellular components in IMD. Analyzing the role of the ATRs in knock-out mice with high dose Nme infections, revealed that the lack of C5aR2, like the lack of C5aR1, was beneficial for the outcome of meningococcal induced sepsis. In contrast, the lack of C3aR in knock-out mice was detrimental. The positive outcome associated with the C5aRs could be reproduced by using an antagonist against both C5aRs or an antagonist specifically against C5aR1 in ...",

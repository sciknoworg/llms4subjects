            "abstract": "Abstract: In fluorescent microscopy, improvements in spatial and temporal resolution open new insights into the interactions of fluorescently labeled proteins. Total internal reflection fluorescent structured illumination microscopy (TIRF-SIM) is a unique approach combining high acquisition speeds with a two-fold increased lateral resolution in comparison to the classical Rayleigh limit at very high contrast.<br>A great part of this work was the construction of a novel TIRF-SIM implementation that enables simultaneous dual-color super-resolution imaging of dynamic, low fluorescent samples at several Hertz with illumination switching times of two to five milliseconds. The design is based on mechanical beam steering and phase shifting devices as well as a Michelson interferometer, thus avoiding diffractive elements.<br>The fast TIRF-SIM setup is employed to gain a clearer view on the cell wall synthesis in Bacillus subtilis, as we still lack fundamental knowledge of how bacteria build, expand and maintain their cell wall. The cytoskeletal protein MreB is an essential component of the bacterial cell-shape generation system. It is hypothesized, that MreB filaments mechanically couple several synthesis motors that putatively synthesize the cell wall, whereas the filaments\u2019 traces mirror the trajectories of the motors. The cell wall synthesis machinery proteins RodA and PbpH are closely associated with MreB and play essential roles in the synthesis process.<br>By imaging these proteins with TIRF-M and TIRF-SIM, directional movement and non-continuous motion patterns could be analyzed in enhanced details. Based on a multi-motor transport model, a mechanistic Brownian dynamics simulation was developed that was able to reproduce measured transport quantities like velocity and number of transport pauses and direction reversals. These new insights support the model of MreB being transported by several motors, where PbpH and RodA are likely candidates for synthesis motors based on their measured and simulated motion patterns",

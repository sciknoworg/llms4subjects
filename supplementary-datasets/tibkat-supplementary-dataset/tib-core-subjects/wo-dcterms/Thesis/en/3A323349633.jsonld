            "abstract": "Calculating molecular vibrational spectra using quantum chemical methods is a standard application nowadays. Due to long computing times use is made of the harmonic approximation with a subsequent scaling of the obtained frequencies by empirically determined scaling factors. An alternative to this procedure is given by scaling the force constants rather than the vibrational frequencies. This opens the possibility to pay respect to the different nature of the internal coordinates. Consequently, significantly higher accuracy can be gained by this approach. In this work examples from the field of organic chemistry were chosen in which the computed spectra provide answers to specific problems. In detail, the identification of polychlorinated dibenzodioxines, the determination of the molecular structure of azulene, and the mechanistic examination of the molecular rearrangement of benzofuroxan were studied. As a prerequisite for these studies transferable scaling factors were determined for the scaling of the force constant matrices. Besides these applications novel ab initio techniques are presented which aim at better harmonic force constants by including electron correlation effects. Two aspects were considered in detail: (1) New transformation techniques and approximative treatments were investigated to enhance the efficiency of well-known methods. (2) Furthermore, new ab initio methods were developed. All studies considered here focus on the local correlation concept of Pulay and Saeb\u00f8. For the local MP2 method a new integral transformation of the internal exchange matrices is presented. Dispersion energies are modeled by a neural network. With respect to the development of new ab initio methods local QCISD energy gradient theory was derived. A comparison of this theory with conventional QCISD gradient theory is provided. Benchmark calculations for molecular structures and vibrational spectra are presented.",

            "abstract": "There is a great demand for the development of highly fluorescent and specific probes that enable a sensitive and early detection of malignancies and a separation from healthy tissue in a non-invasive way by in vivo imaging. The main drawback of fluorescence imaging in vivo is the autofluorescence, which hampers the detection of probe-derived signals. In this study, two novel fluorescence probes were investigated concerning their suitability for visualization of tumors in mice: a pH-sensitive dye, CypHer5E conjugated to the tumor specific antibody Herceptin (pH-Her) as well as polystyrene nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes (15, 25, and 100 nm) and surface modifications (NH2, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and Herceptin) loaded with the broadband fluorophore Itrybe. For this purpose, time-domain near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging was applied in nude mice bearing orthotopic HER2-positive (KPL-4) and HER2-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast tumor xenografts. The pH-sensitivity and functionality of pH-Her was confirmed by spectroscopic measurements and in cell-based assays. In HER2-positive tumor-bearing mice, pH-Her, which increases fluorescence in the acidic environment of the tumor only, combined with subtraction of autofluorescence led to an increased contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and thereby an improved sensitivity of tumor detection, when compared to the always-on fluorescent conjugate Alexa Fluor 647-Herceptin (Alexa-Her) ...",

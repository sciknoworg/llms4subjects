            "abstract": "Common dairy cow nutrition changed from pasture-based feeding to barn systems with the incorporation of preserved feed with corn silage as the main component in the diet. Cows on pasture take up high amounts of essential fatty acids, especially \u03b1-linolenic acid. Corn silage, on the other hand, is rich in linoleic acid but contains low levels of fat and \u03b1-linolenic acid. The unsaturated \u03b1-linolenic and linoleic acid are classified as essential fatty acids because of the inability of mammals, including ruminants, to synthesize them endogenously de novo and must be obtained by feed, particularly in the form of fresh grass. Conjugated linoleic acid is a bioactive compound formed either in the rumen, by biohydrogenation from essential fatty acids, or is synthesized in mammary gland tissue. Therefore, feeding regime and forage type strongly affect the essential fatty acid status and n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio as well as the conjugated linoleic acid status of dairy cows. The essential fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid isomers might have distinct metabolic modulating characteristics and functions in dairy cows and conjugated linoleic acid effects can be partly independent of or synergistic to the effects of essential fatty acids. An insufficient essential fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid supply might lead to impaired metabolic functions and additional supplementation with these fatty acids could potentially be useful in stabilizing the metabolism of a dairy cow, independently or in combination with each other, by compensating for an insufficient energy intake during the transition period, which could be utilized as a strategy to promote animal health and welfare. Therefore, a study with high-yielding dairy cows was conducted that aimed to assess the scope of impact of a combined essential fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid supplementation on performance and energy utilization during the transition period and to inspect changes in milk composition with a reflecting milk fatty acid pattern resulting from ...",

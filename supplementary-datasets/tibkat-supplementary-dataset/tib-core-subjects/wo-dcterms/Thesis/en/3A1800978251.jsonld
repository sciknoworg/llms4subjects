            "abstract": "Articular cartilage is a highly specialized tissue which provides a lubricated gliding surface in joints and thereby enables low-friction movement. If damaged once it has a very low intrinsic healing capacity and there is still no treatment in the clinic which can restore healthy cartilage tissue. 3D biofabrication presents a promising perspective in the field by combining healthy cells and bioactive ink materials. Thereby, the composition of the applied bioink is crucial for defect restoration, as it needs to have the physical properties for the fabrication process and also suitable chemical cues to provide a supportive environment for embedded cells. In the last years, ink compositions with high polymer contents and crosslink densities were frequently used to provide 3D printability and construct stability. But these dense polymeric networks were often associated with restricted bioactivity and impaired cell processes like differentiation and the distribution of newly produced extracellular matrix (ECM), which is especially important in the field of cartilage engineering. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was the development of hyaluronic acid (HA)-based bioinks with a reduced polymer content which are 3D printable and additionally facilitate chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and the homogeneous distribution of newly produced ECM. Starting from not-printable hydrogels with high polymer contents and restricted bioactivity, distinct stepwise improvements were achieved regarding stand-alone 3D printability as well as MSC differentiation and homogeneous ECM distribution. All newly developed inks in this thesis made a valuable contribution in the field of cartilage regeneration and represent promising approaches for potential clinical applications. The underlying mechanisms and established ink design criteria can further be applied to other biofabricated tissues, emphasizing their importance also in a more general research setting. ; Gelenkknorpel erm\u00f6glicht durch seine gleitf\u00e4hige ...",

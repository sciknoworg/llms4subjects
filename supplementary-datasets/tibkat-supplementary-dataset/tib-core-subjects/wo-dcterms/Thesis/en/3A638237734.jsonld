            "abstract": "Sulfate-reduction, anaerobic oxidation of methane, cold seep, metagenomics. - The anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulfate (AOM) removes more than 90% of the methane produced in marine sediments. The process is mediated by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Previous studies focusing on the archaeal part of ANME/SRB consortia yielded as yet only a fragmentary understanding of this process. Additionally, whereas ANME clades have been repeatedly studied with respect to phylogeny, key genes, and genomic capabilities, little is known about their sulfate-reducing partner. Thus, in order to change this situation, this thesis focused on SRB associated with AOM.In the first part of this thesis, SRB associated with Archaea from the ANME-2 clade were investigated. Sequences of bacterial 16S rRNA genes retrieved from ANME-2/SRB enrichment cultures supported a previous hypothesis that ANME-2 associated SRB belong to the SEEP-SRB1 group within the deltaproteobacterial Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) group. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and probes for newly defined SEEP-SRB1 subgroups (a-f), bacteria from the SEEP-SRB1a subgroup were identified as the dominant sulfatereducing partners in ANME-2 consortia in samples from six different AOM sites. In contrast to their abundance as ANME-2 partners, single SEEP-SRB1a cells were very rare (<1%) in all but one of the examined samples. This suggested a highly adapted if not even obligate syntrophic lifestyle of the SEEP-SRB1a group in ANME-2 consortia. Additionally, SEEP-SRB1a was also detected as an alternative partner of archaea of the ANME-3 clade which was previously described to be predominantly associated with SRB of the Desulfobulbus group.In the second part of this thesis, the diversity of SRB in AOM habitats ...",

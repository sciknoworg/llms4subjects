            "abstract": "The rapid spread and high prevalence of CWD in North American cervids have raised concerns about a potential risk to human health. Experimental transmission of CWD to various species has been reported. It was demonstrated by others, that CWD is transmissible to squirrel monkey but so far not to cynomolgus macaques. We investigated prion propagation in cell lines, overexpressing transgenic PrP from humans (Homo sapiens), cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri Sciureus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus Virginianus) to simulate interspecies transmission of CWD in vitro. The permissive HpL3-4 and SH-SY5Y cell lines were retrovirally transduced with PrP of the respective species. We characterised the produced cell lines in detail for transgene integration, transcription, protein expression and cell surface abundance of ectopically expressed PrP. The relative and absolute number of integrated genomic copies and the transcription rate of transgenic PrP were comparable among all cell lines according to quantification by qPCR. Analysis of the glycopattern of transgenic prion protein expressing cell lines confirmed that glycosylation is not dependent on PrP donor species, but on the recipient host cell line. The abundance of transgenic PrP on the cell surface was validated by FACS analysis. All generated cell lines were inoculated with different prion infections agents and tested for prion propagation in vitro ...",

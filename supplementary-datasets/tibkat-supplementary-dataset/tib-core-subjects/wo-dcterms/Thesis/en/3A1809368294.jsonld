            "abstract": "The presented works aimed on the analysis of new impurities in APIs and medicinal products. Different subtypes of LC were coupled to suitable detection methods, i.e. UV and various MS techniques, depending on the chemical natures of the analytes and the analytical task. Unexpected impurities in medicinal products and APIs caused several scandals in the past, concomitant with fatalities or severe side effects in human and veterinary patients. The detection of nitrosamines in sartans led to the discovery of nitrosamines in various other drugs, of which the antibiotic rifampicin was analyzed in this work. An examination of the synthesis of rifampicin revealed a high potential for the formation of 4-methyl-1-nitrosopiperazine (MeNP). An LC-MS/HRMS method suitable for the quantification of MeNP was applied in the analysis of drugs collected from Brazil, Comoros, India, Nepal, and Tanzania, where a single dose of rifampicin is used in the post-exposure prophylaxis of leprosy. All batches were contaminated with MeNP, ranging from 0.7-5.1 ppm. However, application of rifampicin containing up to 5 ppm MeNP was recommended by the regulatory authorities for the post-exposure prophylaxis of leprosy. In the 1990s the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin attracted attention after causing fatalities in the USA, but the causative agent was never identified unequivocally. The related substance sisomicin was recognized as a lead impurity by the Holzgrabe lab at the University of W\u00fcrzburg: sisomicin was accompanied by a variety of other impurities and batches containing sisomicin had caused the fatalities. In 2016, anaphylactic reactions were reported after application of gentamicin. A contamination of the medicinal products with histamine, an impurity of the raw material fish peptone used upon the production, could be identified as the cause of the adverse effects. Batches of gentamicin sulfate, which had been stored at the University of W\u00fcrzburg since the earlier investigations, were analyzed regarding their contamination with ...",

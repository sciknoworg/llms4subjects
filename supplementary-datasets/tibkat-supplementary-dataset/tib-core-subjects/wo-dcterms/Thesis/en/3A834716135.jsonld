            "abstract": "P. indica, a root endophytic fungus, lives in beneficial relationship with plants and protects them from biotic and abiotic stresses. Despite its positive impact on the host, little is known about the genes involved in stress tolerance. In Arabidopsis, a whole cascade of genes participates in abiot-ic stress tolerance responses, starting from stress perception to transcriptional activation of downstream target genes. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) limitation is one of the major abiotic stresses for plants used in agriculture. P. indica is known to improve the nutritional status of the plant by transporting soluble Pi to the host. I identified target genes of P. indica under low Pi (LP) stress conditions in Arabidopsis roots. Understanding the function of the genes and their gene products is of critical importance for the development of transgenic strategies and to improve low Pi stress tolerance in crops. Furthermore, WRKY6 functions as a repressor of several Pi-related processes in LP-exposed Arabidopsis roots, among them are Pi transporter and metabolism genes. Besides stimulation of the Pi metabolism in the wrky6 mutant under LP conditions, P. indica also in-duced root growth development and this effect was stronger in the wrky6 background than in the WT. Using this system, I showed that the three unrelated factors \u201cpresence of P. indica\u201d, \u201cPi lim-itation\u201d and \u201cabsence of WRKY6\u201d promote Pi metabolism and root development in Arabidopsis. I identified genes, which participate in establishing the benefits for the plant.",

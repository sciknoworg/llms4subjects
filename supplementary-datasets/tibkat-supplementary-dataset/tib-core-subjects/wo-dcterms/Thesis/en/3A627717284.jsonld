            "title": "Multi-dimensional radiative transfer in circumstellar disks",
            "abstract": "In this thesis a radiative transfer model for the simulation of protoplanetary disks was developed. As a basis served the general stellar atmosphere package PHOENIX (Hauschildt et al. 1999). Substantial modifications accounting for accretion disk properties have been implemented. The disk is divided into rings and the vertical structure is calculated for each one. A summation of all rings gives a so-called 1+1D disk structure description. The models have been tested and were confronted with high-resolution infrared spectra of the inner disk of T Tauri stars which display rich molecular emission line spectra. The models can reproduce the observational data nicely identifying the properties of the gas in the disk. Furthermore, the simulation of the radiative transfer was extended to 3 dimensions providing a more realistical treatment of the problem. Two major projects were followed with this method. On the one hand, the influence of disk asymmetries, caused e.g. by planets, on the line profile were investigated by means of a 2-level model atom. Second, the influence of the radial radiative transfer of the disk structure was simulated using an iterative method employing both the 1D code for the determination of the hydrostatic equilibrium and the calculation of the opacities as well as the 3D code for the radiative transfer and the temperature correction. The former simulation showed that line asymmetries caused by density waves in the inner disks can be detected in some cases. The latter demonstrated that the disk is heated by radial diffusion leading to a measurable vertical blow-up.",

                "The research project focusses on the theoretical foundation, empirical research and practical advancement of a crosslinguistic approach between the language subjects English and Latin at German grammar schools. At the centre of attention is the so called model \"Latein Plus\", which was introduced in Germany in the 1990s primarily to support the subject Latin. As the research project aims to show, this model is to be considered a rare example of a crosslinguistic approach to foreign language teaching established at German schools. English Language Teaching has not paid much attention to this model up to now, although engaging in crosslinguistic approaches is considered to be highly topical due to ELTa s responsibility for lifelong language learning. The aim of the research project is to gain insights into theoretical and practical conditions that are necessary for teaching and learning English and Latin cognates crosslinguistically. Within a collaborative action research project, data is collected with the help of interviews, questionnaires, document analyses and collaborative problem solving."

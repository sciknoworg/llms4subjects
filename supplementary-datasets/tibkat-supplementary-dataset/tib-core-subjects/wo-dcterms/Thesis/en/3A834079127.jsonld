            "title": "Multi-sensor synergy for persistent scatterer interferometry based ground subsidence monitoring",
            "abstract": "Ground subsidence is a common phenomenon which causes disturbances and damages on the Earth\u2019s surface. Especially in urban areas, it poses risk to life and property. Establishing solutions for damage prevention requires knowledge of subsidence behavior over time and space, which entails the collection of geospatial information. The present work investigates the ground surface dynamics over a field of deep mining in Sondershausen, Germany based on multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Deformation patterns are extracted by means of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), a technique that exploits the spatio-temporal characteristics of interferometric signatures from persistent scatterers. Since the impact of subsidence on surface structures varies spatially, high-risk areas can only be identified when the subsidence profile is known. To model the geometry of the subsidence bowl, the present study extends the extracted point information to a surface of estimations by interpolation. Furthermore, by the synergistic usage of PS estimations from different satellite sensors, this research addresses the problem of undersampling in critical areas, which is a common limitation of the PSI approach. The methodology developed here estimates missing information, i.e. refines the initial model, by deformation map of a different sensor covering a different time interval. In order to extend the period of monitoring as well as to improve the spatial and temporal sampling, the ground subsidence in Sondershausen is monitored with a multi-sensor SAR dataset. The C- and L-band acquisitions of the sensors ERS-1/2 (1995\u20132005), Envisat-ASAR (2004\u20132010) and ALOS-PALSAR (2007\u20132010) are used to derive 15 years of subsidence information at the location of persistent scatterers. From a temporal viewpoint, the obtained deformation maps indicate a non-linearly decreasing trend of ground subsidence, which is consistent with the backfilling history of the mine. From a spatial viewpoint, the results suggest one major subsidence trough located in the urban area of Sondershausen and a minor one found in the nearby village of Gro\u00dffurra. The PSI deformation maps and models are validated in reference to the available leveling measurements covering the site in Sondershausen. In general, the validation results suggest a good agreement between the PSI and surveying models with the normalized root-mean-square error (RMSE) lower than 0.11. However, some significant deviations of ERS estimations are also found for a critical region. In this area the absence of persistent scatterers contributes largely to the observed differences. Consequently, the spatial refinement by synergy is applied to this region. The integration of points from ASAR or PALSAR deformation maps result in an improvement in the modeled geometry of the subsidence trough. With this improvement the RMSE calculated for the ERS model is decreased from 0.061 to 0.054. The application demonstrates the synergistic potential of multi-sensor PSI analysis to improve the interpretation of ground subsidence characteristics and, thus, to increase the confidence of risk assessment.",

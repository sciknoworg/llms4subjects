            "abstract": "Diphtheria toxin (DT) expressing Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the etiological agent of the classical respiratory diphtheria. Since the introduction of diphtheria toxoid vaccines cases of respiratory diphtheria declined significantly over the years. Nevertheless, local outbreaks, e.g. in the former Soviet Union in 1990s, in Venezuela or Yemen are reported and consistently associated with poor access to vaccination. Despite the constant high global vaccination coverage, the number of reported diphtheria cases increased within the last years. However, beside C. diphtheriae, other pathogenic corynebacteria e.g. C. ulcerans, C. pseudotuberculosis and the novel identified C. silvaticum are known to cause severe infections in humans and animals. Regardless of the medical and veterinary importance, only few virulence factors besides diphtheria toxin and phospholipase D are known. In frame of this thesis, the basic molecular and proteomic characterization and characterization of the infection process of pathogenic corynebacteria were carried out. A group of non-toxigenic tox-gene bearing (NTTB) C. ulcerans, isolated from wild animals, were assembled into a wild life cluster. Dangel and co-workers first designated this group as a novel species Corynebacterium silvaticum, in 2020. A member of this novel species is strain W25, who was identified as C. ulcerans, firstly (Busch et al., 2019). Phylogenomic analyzes revealed, that strain W25 belongs to a novel species along with a C. pseudotuberculosis strain PO100/5 and C. ulcerans KL1196 (M\u00f6ller et al., 2020b). Genome analyses revealed 172 unique genes in C. silvaticum and two missing enzymes, a pullulanase type I and a 1,4-\u03b1 amylase, which results in a lack of the ability to ferment starch. The main characteristic of this species is the NTTB phenotype. An examination of the tox-gene sequence in W25 showed a two base (GG) insertion which results in a pseudogene due to a frameshift mutation. RNA hybridization experiments and detection methods for the diphtheria toxin ...",

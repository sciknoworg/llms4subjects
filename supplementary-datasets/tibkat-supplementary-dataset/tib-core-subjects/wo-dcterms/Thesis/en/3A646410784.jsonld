            "title": "Comparative QTL mapping in diploid and alloploid Brassica species to analyze fixed heterosis",
            "abstract": "The spontaneous hybridization of related species by combining their genomes (alloploidy) has played a prominent role in plant evolution. Main reasons for the success of allopolyploids are the favourable interactions between loci on homoeologous chromosomes which is similar to the positive interactions between different alleles of the same locus causing classical heterosis in heterozygous genotypes. Those favourable interactions between homoeologous loci should result in an increased performance of allopolyploids compared to their parental species, even in homozygous genotypes. Therefore, such positive epistatic interactions can be called fixed heterosis\u02ba. Brassica napus (genome constitution AACC) is a very suitable model system to analyze fixed\u02ba heterosis and intergenomic dominance because artificial resynthesized\u02ba lines can easily be developed from diploid parental species B. rapa (AA) and B. oleracea (CC). It is also possible to produce genotypes of the constitutions AAAC or ACCC. When comparing such genotypes with the mean of their parents (AA and AACC or AACC and CC, respectively), the occurrence of intergenomic dominance\u02ba can also be investigated. The aim of this project was (i) to analyze the effect of intergenomic dominance for different dosages of the A and C genome in tetraploids and triploids, and (ii) to perform a comparative mapping of QTL involved in fixed heterosis between the parental species B. rapa and B. oleracea and the allopolyploid. For the analysis of intergenomic dominance all possible crossings between the diploid and tetraploid homozygous parental lines and the resulting resynthesized rapeseed were performed for two different combinations of the A and C genome  one B. rapa var oleifera and one B. oleracea var. alboglabra, and one B. rapa var. trilocularis and one B. oleracea var. alboglabra. Via bud pollinations and for the cross AACCxCCCC additional via embryo rescue seeds were developed ...",

            "abstract": "Land-use intensification is identified as one of the major threats for biodiversity worldwide. The number of endangered species is increasing and only few species mostly generalists seem to benefit from land-use intensification. Consequently, land-use intensification affects species with specific life-history trait characteristics stronger than others. Different levels of land-use intensity provide different biotic and abiotic contexts for interacting species and thus can influence multitrophic interactions differently. Land-use intensity influences many ecological aspects, but regions with different environmental context can modify such effects. Therefore, in my thesis I asked how land-use intensity affects ecological variables such as species richness, abundance and the occurrence of endangered species (chapter II), ecological and life-history trait characteristics (hereafter referred as traits) (chapter III) and multitrophic interactions (chapter IV). I was interested, if effects differ between regions. For my study in chapter II I used butterflies and day-active moths (hereafter termed Lepidoptera) as a target group. I obtained the threat status from Red Lists of Germany to identify endangered species. I expected a decline of Lepidoptera species richness, abundance and the occurrence of endangered species with increasing land-use intensity dependent on the region. In chapter III I excluded day-active moths from the dataset used in chapter II, because only for butterflies sufficient data on ten selected ecological and life-history traits were available in the literature. I expected traits to change with increasing land-use intensity from characteristics of specialists to such of generalists due to frequent habitat disturbances ...",

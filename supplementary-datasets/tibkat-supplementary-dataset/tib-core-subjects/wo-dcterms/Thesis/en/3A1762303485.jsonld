            "title": "The voice of walls : a grounded theory study of the gezi movement\u00b4s graffiti",
            "abstract": "Gezi movement is the broadest and most unprecedented social movement of Turkey's recent history. The movement has emerged in Istanbul, diffused just in a few days into 80 cities of the country with the participation of 3.5 million people and uttered crucial issues and demands that accumulated within the Turkish society before its rapid dissolution. The questions of \"What the Gezi movement means?\" and \"What is the emergent Gezi spirit?\" have been and will be one of the major problematics for the relevant scholarship. This thesis generates a constructivist grounded theory analysis on one of the most widespread forms of Gezi movement's activism; graffiti. The study is built on the three major theoretical arch stones; social movements, space and graffiti, and in this way, it discovers, interprets and theorises the patterns of Gezi graffiti in order to build an interpretative analysis. The theory that is generated by the study, suggests that beyond all the novel forms of collective identities, actions and discourses, the movement is about the overlooked ancient and chronic issues, which pertain to Turkish social and political formation.",

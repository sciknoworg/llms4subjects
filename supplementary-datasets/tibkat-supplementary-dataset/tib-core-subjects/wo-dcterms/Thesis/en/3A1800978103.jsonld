            "abstract": "T lymphocytes (T cells) represent one of the major cell populations of the immune system. Named by the place of their development, the thymus, several types can be distinguished as the \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, the mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT), and the natural killer T (NKT) cells. The \u03b1\u03b2 lineages of CD4+ THelper and the CD8+ T cytotoxic cells with the T cell receptor (TCR) composed of \u03b1- and \u03b2-chain are major players of the adaptive immune system. In the thymus, CD4+ and CD8+ single positive (SP) \u03b1\u03b2 cells represent the ultimate result of positive and negative selection of CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes. The DP population derives from the double negative (DN) thymocytes that develop from bone marrow-derived progenitors through different stages (DN1-DN4) that are characterized by CD25 and CD44 surface expression. NFATc1, a member of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors family, is critically involved in the differentiation and function of T cells. During thymocyte development, the nuclear expression of NFATc1 reaches the highest level at the DN3 (CD44-CD25+) stage. The hematopoietic cell-specific ablation of NFATc1 activity results in an arrest of thymocyte differentiation at the DN1 (CD44+CD25-) stage. On the other hand, over-expression of a constitutively active version of NFATc1 results in an impaired transition of DN3 cells to the DN4 (CD44-CD25-) stage, suggesting that a certain threshold level of NFATc1 activity is critical at this point. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis allowed us the identification of NFATc1/A target genes involved in lineage development as the Tcra and Tcrb gene loci. Furthermore, we identified multiple NFATc1-regulated genes that are involved in \u03b3\u03b4 T cell development. In the mouse models, Rag1Cre-Nfatc1fl/fl and Rag1Cre-E2fl/fl, in which the activity of NFATc1 or inducible NFATc1 in the latter is impaired during the early stages of thymocyte development, we observed increased numbers of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. These \u03b3\u03b4 T cells showed an unusual ...",

            "abstract": "This longitudinal study, conducted from February to December 2018 in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, aimed to compare the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in conventional and organic pig farms. A total of three conventional and four organic farms took part in the study. One of the organic farms (farm 4) was distributed over two sites, which were considered as two separate epidemiological units. Furthermore, faecal samples were collected from feral pigs near Greifswald in autumn/winter 2018/2019 and analysed for their ESBL status. ESBL-positive E. coli, especially of the CTX M type, were found in all fattening farms, so that the study confirms, as expected, that antibiotic resistance is widespread in pig fattening and affects both conventional and organic farms. The results of the bacteriological investigation showed that the percentage of ESBL-positive pens was greater on conventional farms (55.2%) than on organic farms (44.8%) (p < 0.001). A detailed analysis of the individual farms showed that the percentage of ESBL-positive pens was very similar in the conventional farms (54.3 - 61.9%), while there was a wide variation between 7.7 and 84.2% among the organic farms. There were indications that the farms of origin, from which weaner pigs were purchased, can have a major influence on the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in the fattening farms. Resistance testing using the resistance screening test showed that the proportion of pens with multi-resistant E. coli was similar in conventional (28.6%) and organic (31.5%) farms. The proportion of pens with ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli was even higher in organic farms (17.3%) than in conventional farms (9.2%) (p = 0.007). However, it can be deduced from the observations with regard to multi- and ciprofloxacin resistance of the individual farms that a high proportion of ESBL-positive fattening groups does not always mean a high proportion of multi-resistant or ciprofloxacin-resistant groups, but that farm-specific variations are possible.

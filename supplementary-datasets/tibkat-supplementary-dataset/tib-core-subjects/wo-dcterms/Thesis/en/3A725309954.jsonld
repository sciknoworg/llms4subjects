            "abstract": "Fatty acids are essential components of cellular life. However, in their natural form they cannot enter metabolism but in fact they need enzymatic activation by coenzyme A to become metabolically accessible. One enzyme class catalyzing such a reaction is called long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (LACS). Although the chemical aspects of this reaction are well understood the biological impact remained largely unknown, since pronounced phenotypes of LACS mutants have not been reported so far. However, in this project it has been shown that deletion of these activities can lead to severe phenotypes affecting processes throughout the whole plant life cycle. The observations were made by the establishment of a LACS mutant collection with dozen of double and triple knock-out lines. Some lines showed reduced or even absent fertility and reduced surface wax levels caused by a reduced synthesis of very long chain lipids. Other mutants showed light dependent phenotypes resulting in severely altered plant morphology. These modifications were most likely due to perturbations of the lipid metabolism. In this context, a reduced flux between prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathway is assumed based on radiolabeled flux analysis. In addition, embryo development and storage lipid synthesis were reduced in some lines indicating important roles of specific LACS enzymes also in these processes ...",

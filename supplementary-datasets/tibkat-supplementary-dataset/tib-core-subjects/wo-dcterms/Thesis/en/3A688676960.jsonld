            "abstract": "Despite zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an important model for understanding vertebrate development during the last decades, sex determination and differentiation are not clear. To date no sex chromosome has been identified. On the contrary a number of genes have been linked to sex determination process in zebrafish. Environmental factors, such as water temperature, have an effect on sex determination mechanism. Till now only few studies were conducted on temperature dependent sex determination and differentiation in zebrafish. The targets of the thesis are investigating the influence of elevated rearing temperature at 35\u02bfC on sex determination during the early stages (embryogenesis) and later on the sex differentiation during larval development in zebrafish. In the first experiment, effect of early heat shock (35\u02bfC) during the embryogenesis was analyzed onto phenotypic sex in zebrafish. The fertilized eggs were generated by crossing a mitotic gynogenetic male with three golden coloured females and subjected the embryos to heat treatment of 35\u02bfC applied from 5-10 hpf, 5-24 hpf and 5-48 hpf, which corresponds to the following developmental stages: gastrula, gastrula to segmentation, and gastrula to pharyngula stage, respectively ...",

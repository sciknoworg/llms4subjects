            "title": "Role of Neuroligins at the inhibitory postsynaptic compartment of the Retina",
            "abstract": "Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell adhesion proteins central to synapse maturation and function.There are four isoforms of Neuroligins (14) expressed in the rodent brain. Neuroligins 1 and 2 are localized at excitatory and inhibitory postsynapses, respectively. In contrast, the distribution and underlying function of the other two isoforms (Neuroligins 3 and 4) at central synapses have remained largely unresolved. Neuroligins are also expressed in humans, and interestingly, mutations in Neuroligins 3 and 4 have been found in a subset of autistic patients.The current study aims at characterizing the distribution and function of Neuroligins in the well-structured network of the mouse retina by using isoform-specific antibodies and single deletion mutant mice. The retina is well suited for both detailed anatomical analyses and functional assays, making it a robust system to study the role of Neuroligins in the formation and maintenance of a functional neural circuit and hence information processing.The role of Neuroligin 2 in synaptic transmission and network function was first investigated. Throughout the retina, Neuroligin 2 is localized preferentially to inhibitory GABAergic postsynapses and largely precluded from glycinergic or glutamatergic postsynapses. Accordingly, the lack of Neuroligin 2 results in a severe reduction of GABAA receptor clustering at the inner synaptic layer, and in further subtle alterations of the retinal circuitry. Altogether, these impairments are detrimental to the coding of visual information by retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina. Taken together, these results indicate that Neuroligin 2 is essential for the functional integrity of GABAergic signaling and as a consequence, for information processing ...",

            "abstract": "Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) is a peptide derived from proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2 and \u03b3-secretases. While multiple isoforms of this protein are present in the human brain, to date research on A\u03b2 has focused on the pathological effect of the predominant A\u03b21-42 species as the major component of senile plaques present in Alzheimer\u00b4s disease brains. More recently, the discovery of A\u03b2 presence at low levels in normal healthy brains has prompted investigation of its physiological function. These new findings have reported a previously unknown positive regulatory effect of A\u03b2 on long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory, suggesting its beneficial physiological role when present in low concentrations in the brain (Puzzo et al., 2008;Puzzo et al., 2011). Interestingly, the N-terminal A\u03b2 fragment has been suggested to be particularly effective in this neuromodulation (Lawrence et al., 2014;Richter et al., 2018). Despite of several hints pointing to role of A\u03b2 and other APP-derived fragments in the regulation of presynaptic function, a systematic investigation has not been performed yet. To close this gap, we explored the potential role of physiological concentrations of APP/A\u03b2-derived fragments in the modulation of presynaptic activity and the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this process. We identified distinct effects of N- and C-terminal part of A\u03b21-42 on recycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in cultured primary neurons. While the N-terminal A\u03b2 fragment (A\u03b21-16) enhanced synaptic transmission via an increase in the fraction of recycling pool of SVs, the C- terminal fragment (A\u03b217-42) had no effect. The observed enhancement of SV recycling driven by the N-terminal A\u03b2 fragment required functional alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\u03b17nAchRs). It was completely blocked by \u03b1-Bungarotoxin (BgTx), a selective antagonist of these receptors, and was absent in neurons from \u03b17nAchRs knockout mice. Our data suggested that A\u03b2 acts as a positive allosteric modulator of \u03b17nAchRs rather than an ...",

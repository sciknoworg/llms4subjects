            "abstract": "Targeted protein ubiquitylation that occurs in eukaroytes is often performed by cullin-RING-based E3 Ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), a superfamily of E3s. These types of ligases are composed of a modular E3 core containing a cullin and a RING domain protein, and a substrate specificity module usually composed of a linker protein and a substrate recognition subunit (SRS). The combination of distinct substrate specificity modules with core components creates unique CRL complexes that bind distinct sets of substrates. The rather uncharacterized F-box and WD40 repeats containing protein 5 (Fbxw5) represents a special SRS, since it has the potential to assemble into two different types of CRLs: via its F-box domain into Cul1-based (SCF) complexes and via DWD boxes into Cul4A-based complexes. Up to date, it has remained elusive, whether Fbxw5 assembles into functional SCF complexes in vivo. Here, we show that in mammalian tissue culture cells under normal growth conditions, overexpressed and endogenous Fbxw5 predominantly assembles into SCF complexes and we identify the epidermal growth factor kinase substrate 8 (Eps8) as the first target of SCFFbxw5. Eps8 is a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton remodeling and receptor endocytosis that  when upregulated  can contribute to increased migration and invasiveness of cancer cells. Fbxw5 interacts with Eps8 endogenously, reconstituted SCFFbxw5 ubiquitylates Eps8 in vitro, and down-regulation of Fbxw5 in HeLa cells can result in stabilization of Eps8, indicating that SCFFbxw5 targets Eps8 for degradation in vivo ...",

            "title": "Varve and event layer chronology of Lake Suigetsu (Japan) back to 40 kyr BP and contribution to the international consensus atmospheric radiocarbon calibration curve",
            "abstract": "The main intention of the PhD project was to create a varve chronology for the Suigetsu Varves 2006' (SG06) composite profile from Lake Suigetsu (Japan) by thin section microscopy. The chronology was not only to provide an age-scale for the various palaeo-environmental proxies analysed within the SG06 project, but also and foremost to contribute, in combination with the SG06 14C chronology, to the international atmospheric radiocarbon calibration curve (IntCal). The SG06 14C data are based on terrestrial leaf fossils and therefore record atmospheric 14C values directly, avoiding the corrections necessary for the reservoir ages of the marine datasets, which are currently used beyond the tree-ring limit in the IntCal09 dataset (Reimer et al., 2009). The SG06 project is a follow up of the SG93 project (Kitagawa & van der Plicht, 2000), which aimed to produce an atmospheric calibration dataset, too, but suffered from incomplete core recovery and varve count uncertainties. For the SG06 project the complete Lake Suigetsu sediment sequence was recovered continuously, leaving the task to produce an improved varve count. Varve counting was carried out using a dual method approach utilizing thin section microscopy and micro X-Ray Fluorescence (\u00b5XRF). The latter was carried out by Dr. Michael Marshall in cooperation with the PhD candidate. The varve count covers 19 m of composite core, which corresponds to the time frame from \u224810 to \u224840 kyr BP. The count result showed that seasonal layers did not form in every year. Hence, the varve counts from either method were incomplete. This rather common problem in varve counting is usually solved by manual varve interpolation. But manual interpolation often suffers from subjectivity. Furthermore, sedimentation rate estimates (which are the basis for interpolation) are generally derived from neighbouring, well varved intervals. This assumes that the sedimentation rates in neighbouring intervals are identical to those in the incompletely varved section, which is not necessarily true. To overcome these problems a novel interpolation method was devised. It is computer based and automated (i.e. avoids subjectivity and ensures reproducibility) and derives the sedimentation rate estimate directly from the incompletely varved interval by statistically analysing distances between successive seasonal layers. Therefore, the interpolation approach is also suitable for sediments which do not contain well varved intervals. Another benefit of the novel method is that it provides objective interpolation error estimates. Interpolation results from the two counting methods were combined and the resulting chronology compared to the 14C chronology from Lake Suigetsu, calibrated with the tree-ring derived section of IntCal09 (which is considered accurate). The varve and 14C chronology showed a high degree of similarity, demonstrating that the novel interpolation method produces reliable results. In order to constrain the uncertainties of the varve chronology, especially the cumulative error estimates, U-Th dated speleothem data were used by linking the low frequency 14C signal of Lake Suigetsu and the speleothems, increasing the accuracy and precision of the Suigetsu calibration dataset. The resulting chronology also represents the age-scale for the various palaeo-environmental proxies analysed in the SG06 project. One proxy analysed within the PhD project was the distribution of event layers, which are often representatives of past floods or earthquakes. A detailed microfacies analysis revealed three different types of event layers, two of which are described here for the first time for the Suigetsu sediment. The types are: matrix supported layers produced as result of subaqueous slope failures, turbidites produced as result of landslides and turbidites produced as result of flood events. The former two are likely to have been triggered by earthquakes. The vast majority of event layers was related to floods (362 out of 369), which allowed the construction of a respective chronology for the last 40 kyr. Flood frequencies were highly variable, reaching their greatest values during the global sea level low-stand of the Glacial, their lowest values during Heinrich Event 1. Typhoons affecting the region represent the most likely control on the flood frequency, especially during the Glacial. However, also local, non-climatic controls are suggested by the data. In summary, the work presented here expands and revises knowledge on the Lake Suigetsu sediment and enabls the construction of a far more precise varve chronology. The 14C calibration dataset is the first such derived from lacustrine sediments to be included into the (next) IntCal dataset.

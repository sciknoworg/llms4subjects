            "abstract": "Social health inequality has received considerable attention in public health and social epidemiological research for many years. Numerous empirical studies document the relationship between declining social status and poor health also in Germany. Despite extensive research and public interest, this \"social gradient\" shows no tendency to decrease over time. Due to the topicality and relevance of the subject, the thesis examines social determinants of health in Germany. The thesis starts with presenting the development of the research field on an international level and discussing theoretical foundations. Using a systematic cross-reference search, an extensive literature review summarizes the current state of research of empirical studies in Germany. The results indicate for a variety of diseases a relation with factors at the individual and socio-spatial level. The classification and comparison of these studies allows the identification of new research perspectives. These form the basis of the empirical analyses, which use rich survey data from the Robert Koch Institute's \"GEDA\" study. First, the influence of social determinants on health status is examined at the national level. The results illustrate that the socioeconomic factors income, education and employment exert an independent and significant influence on health, even when intermediary factors are taken into account. By linking the data with aggregated spatial information, it can further be shown that the social gradient varies based on the location\u2019s attractiveness and that specific factors such as a high density of physicians or low particulate matter pollution are associated with good subjective health. Second, the Ruhr area is analyzed as a specific region with regard to social differences in morbidity and utilization of medical services in the elderly population. The results show social disparities for all diseases considered - especially for hypertension, obesity, coronary heart disease and COPD. Medical service utilization, however, only partially reflects this higher burden of disease. The results allow a better understanding of the influencing factors as well as the burden of disease and healthcare needs of socially disadvantaged population groups. Based on these results, perspectives for improving health equity in Germany and structurally weak regions are discussed. The thesis thus provides new insights into social inequality in health in Germany and contributes to social epidemiological research.

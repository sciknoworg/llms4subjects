            "abstract": "Mykoplasmen, Lungenseuche, Pleuralerguss. - The current study focused on transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm) in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo. For in vivo study, pleural effusion (PE) from cattle experimentally infected with Mmm was used for proteomic characterization of in vivo adapted Mmm. For ex vivo study, a system of growing Mmm in non-inactivated bovine serum was established and tested as a method of implementing 3R sytem (Replace, Reduce or Refine animal tests) for studying about Mmm. For the in vitro study, Mmm grown in an artificial media with standard growth conditions at early logarithmic and stationary growth phases was used to do transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Furthermore, proteomic profile of bovine PE from cattle experimentally infected with Mmm was conducted for the first time. Pleural effusion from cattle with experimental infection of Mmm revealed considerable number of viable Mmm cells, which are able to replicate in PE, which allowed us to rename the PE as a suitable \u2018in vivo niche\u2019 of Mmm. The proteomic investigation of PE from these experimentally infected cattle revealed Mmm and bovine proteins. A total of 315 putative predicted Mmm proteins were detected. Bioinformatic analysis of these proteins revealed their predicted localizations and function. Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis were the main functions of the identified Mmm proteins followed by carbohydrate metabolism. Mmm proteins, which are involved in capsule synthesis such as ManB, Glf and Glycosyltransferases were detected. Moreover, previously identified virulence associated proteins such as LppQ, (involved in inflammation), GtsA, GlpF, GlpK and GlpO (involved in glycerol transport and metabolism followed by release of reactive oxygen species) were detected, indirectly proving the disease pathology. Bovine proteins detected from the PE were mainly plasma proteins with an enrichment of proteins of the innate immune system such as complement components, CD markers, proteins indicative of platelet activation and degranulation. Acute phase proteins (APPs) such as serum amyloid-A, haptoglobin and fibrinogen beta chain were highly abundant in PE. This supports the pathophysiology of the disease. The other finding of bovine proteins in this study is the detection of SPARC (Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) and thrombospondin proteins, which indicate fibrosis. Transcriptomic analysis of Mmm in the early logarithmic and stationary growth phases were conducted in vitro in standard medium using strand specific deep RNA sequencing. The result revealed expression of 90 % of the total annotated Mmm genes during these two growth phases, and of these, a total of 34 genes were significantly differentially expressed (q-value < 0.01) with a fold change of \u00b1 2. Basic information about the pathogen\u2019s molecular characteristic was identified including determination of multigene operons (227), 5\u2019-UTRs (354), 3\u2019-UTRs (238), transcriptional start sites (664) and non-coding RNAs (58) in Mmm strain Gladysdale. Proteomic analysis of samples from the same time points revealed the translation of 53 % of the putative predicted proteins. The use of these transcriptomic and proteomic data for proteogenomic study is recommended so as to reveal non-annotated novel protein coding genes and improvement of genome annotation. Preliminary investigation dealing with the establishment of ex vivo growth conditions, which mimics in vivo situation using non-inactivated bovine serum, was performed. Non-inactivated bovine serum was reported to inhibit the growth of mycoplasma. Using a step-wise adaptation process, Mmm were able to grow in non-inactivated bovine serum. Immunologic investigation of Mmm grown in non inactivated serum revealed detection of more antigens using sera from infected cattle as compared to Mmm grown in standard media. Additionally, proteomic analysis on selected protein bands of Mmm grown in non-inactivated serum revealed bovine and Mmm proteins, where complement components were the major bovine proteins and ABC transporter and substrate-binding protein and phosphotransferase system EIIC were major Mmm proteins detected. Further investigation dealing with quantitative proteomic and transcriptomic analysis remains to be a priority for better understanding of Mmm survival in non-inactivated bovine serum. In conclusion, (i) Mmm produces virulence associated and immune evasion proteins in vivo and in environments mimicking in vivo, (ii) bovine PE from cattle with CBPP is composed of plasma proteins with abundant APPs and proteins of the innate immune system, (iii) during in vitro growth majority of genes are transcribed and proteins translated with minimal differential expression in different growth phases, which gives a baseline information for future comparative studies using in vivo samples or for the pathogen grown under stress conditions, (iv) Mmm can be adapted to grow in non-inactivated bovine serum and this can be used as a 3R model for better investigation of virulence studies so as to be able to identify potential candidates for vaccines, diagnostics or therapeutic targets.",

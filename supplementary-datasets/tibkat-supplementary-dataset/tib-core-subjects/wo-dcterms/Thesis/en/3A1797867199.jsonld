            "abstract": "Motoneurons are highly compartmentalized cells with very long extensions that separate their nerve terminals from cell bodies. To maintain their extensive morphological complexity and protect their cellular integrity from neurotoxic stresses, neurons rely on the functions of RNA-binding proteins. One such protein is hnRNP R, a multifunctional protein with a plethora of roles related to RNA metabolism that comes into play in the nervous system. hnRNP R is localized mainly in the nucleus but also exists in the cytoplasm and axons of motoneurons. Increasing in vitro evidence indicates a potential function of hnRNP R in the development and maintenance of motoneurons by regulating axon growth and axonal RNA transport. Additionally, hnRNP R interacts with several proteins involved in motoneuron diseases. Hnrnpr pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing to produce transcripts encoding two protein isoforms: a full-length protein (hnRNP R-FL) and a shorter form lacking the N-terminal acidic domain (hnRNP R-\u0394N). While the neuronal defects produced by total hnRNP R depletion have been investigated before, the contribution of individual isoforms towards such functions has remained mostly unknown. In this study, we showed that while both isoforms are expressed across multiple tissues, the full-length isoform is particularly abundant in the nervous system. We generated a mouse model for selective knockout of the full-length hnRNP R isoform (Hnrnprtm1a/tm1a) and found that the hnRNP R-\u2206N isoform remains expressed in these mice and is upregulated in a compensatory post-transcriptional process. We found that the truncated isoform is sufficient to support subcellular RNA transport related to axon growth in primary motoneurons. However, Hnrnprtm1a/tm1a mice show defects in DNA damage repair after exposure to \u03b3-irradiation and etoposide. Knock down of both hnRNP R isoforms showed a similar extent of DNA damage as for motoneurons depleted of just full-length hnRNP R. Rescue experiments showed that expression of full-length hnRNP R but ...",

Public extension services have applied many programs to deliver technical support which is deemed appropriate for the physical, financial, and institutional conditions of the newly reclaimed lands. Nevertheless, many studies have indicated that these programs are not effective. Furthermore most of these studies assess the impact of extension services at the adoption level only, which is less informative regarding the applications&rsquo; shortcomings and the external factors that could influence program performance. The Sugar Beet Program (SBP) is one of those programs and is implemented on both old and new lands. The SBP&rsquo;s intended outcome is to improve Sugar Beet Growers&rsquo; (SBGs) knowledge and applications, thus leading to increase production efficiency and profits. The objective of this study is to elaborate on the knowledge surrounding the strengths and weakness of such programs according to when, where, and how they are planned, implemented and evaluated ...",

            "abstract": "Abstract: The guidance of surgical instruments during endoscopic and laparoscopic interventions presents challenges associated with the impaired manual dexterity and difficult vision common in these settings. Thermal treatments such as laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, and argon-plasma coagulation (APC) have the added complexity of requiring careful positioning of the instrument and constant status feedback on treated tissue. This work introduces three optical-fiber-based sensor systems providing real-time feedback on the position of the surgical tool and two key parameters of the tissue under treatment: its temperature and its diffuse reflectance spectrum. The location of the surgical tool with respect to the neighboring tissue is estimated using a custom, low-cost FMCW-lidar system that can measure distances to objects up to 50 mm apart with a precision below 3 \u00b5m in 200 \u00b5s. Using this technology, a probe-head that generates five measurement beams estimates the tilt of the tool and its minimum distance to the tissue. Furthermore, a contact-less endoscopic pyrometric temperature sensor that reports the surface temperature of the tissue under treatment was developed. A novel piezoelectric-driven broadband fiber-optic intensity modulator enables lock-in detection, ensuring drift-free temperature measurements in the 36\u00b0C to 235\u00b0C range. Finally, a fiber-based diffuse reflectance spectroscopy sensor is presented, able to infer and classify the ablation state of the tissue in real-time using machine learning. Thanks to the fiber-based design of these sensors, they can be embedded in a wide variety of surgical instruments, offering a high potential to improve both safety and efficiency of endoscopic treatments",

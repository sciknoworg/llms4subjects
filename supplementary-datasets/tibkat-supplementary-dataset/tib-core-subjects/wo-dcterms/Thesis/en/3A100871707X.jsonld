            "title": "A grammatical description of Golpa : a dying Yolnu language",
            "abstract": "This thesis is the first detailed description of Golpa, a seriously endangered Yol\u014bu language that is still proudly spoken by very few people on Elcho Island, in the north eastern corner of Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. Only one the remaining speakers is still fluent. Yol\u014bu languages belong to the Pama-Nyungan language family. Within the Yol\u014bu language bloc Golpa is counted among the Nha\u014bu language varieties which have received the leat linguistic attention. Nha\u014bu used to be spoken by a number of clans all along the Wessel Islands. The Golpa clan is the only one left from these Nha\u014bu speaking Wessel clans. Other Nha\u014bu varieties are spoken westwards towards Milingimbi and Maningrida. However, they differ from Golpa (and presumably also from the other already extinct and not documented Wessel Island Nha\u014bu varieties) in regard to their lexical and grammatical inventory. The grammatical description is based on the analysis of the morphological and syntactic constructions exhibited in the created text corpus and on data obtained in the course of elicitation. Some data was collected by observing actual conversations in Golpa. The description mainly rests upon data obtained from two fluent speakers and two semi-speakers. Therefore, this grammatical account differs from descriptions based on data from many speakers in a lively speech community. Like other Yol\u014bu languages, Golpa is typologically agglutinative, synthetic and predominantly dependent marking, showing no required order for S, A, V or O. Yol\u014bu languages mainly differ from each other in regard to their verbal systems. This is also the case when comparing Golpa with other Yol\u014bu varieties. However, unlike all other languages in that region, Golpa does not have any auxiliaries. Also, there are some distinct grammatical phenomena which appear to be related, at least to some degree, to the infrequent use of the language and the obsolescence process. It is remarkable that despite the very small number of (semi-)speakers and the limited use of the language over the past decades, Golpa still is a fully functional language with no pathological signs. It still shows a great amount of complexity and a large number of categories.",

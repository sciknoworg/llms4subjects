            "abstract": "In this study the role the gene schlappohr (shlp) during development of Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) was investigated. shlp encodes a evolutionary highly conserved protein with unknown function. Structure prediction based on the SMART algorithm suggests that Shlp is a single pass transmembrane protein with a classical amino terminal signal peptide followed by a large extracellular domain. Furthermore, a C-terminal only 22 amino acid long intracellular domain is predicted. An alignment of this domain with orthologues from different species reveals high sequence conservation with the very last eight carboxy terminal amino acids even being identical between all animal orthologues. This highly conserved C-terminal domain of Shlp was identified in a yeast-two-hybrid screen with the N-terminus of the polarity protein Bazooka (Baz) as bait. Initially the subcellular localization of Shlp in embryonic neuroblasts (NBs) pointed to a role during the establishment of cortical localization of Baz in NBs, a process which is until now poorly understood. However, further analysis of a shlp mutant that was generated in the course of this study provided evidence that Shlp is not required for cortical recruitment of Baz. Analysis of the shlp mutant also revealed that the cortical localization of Shlp in NBs was an artifact caused by the antibody used in immunofluorescence stainings. shlp mutant flies are viable and fertile but show defects in wing expansion and cuticle tanning that are strikingly similar to defects found in flies with defective Bursicon (Burs) signaling, however with a much lower penetrance ...",

            "abstract": "The androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are closely related transcription factors that have distinct biological functions but recognize nearly identical DNA binding sites. To provide insights into this apparent paradox, I studied the role of genomic binding, the chromatin environment and cofactor interactions in driving receptor-specific gene regulation. To study differences of the receptors in an identical cellular context I generated a U2OS cell line stably expressing AR and compared it to the existing GR-expressing U2OS cell line. Activation of the receptors revealed the expression of receptor-specific as well as shared target genes. I found that receptor-specific gene expression can in part be driven by subtle binding differences of the receptors. In order to investigate whether divergent DNA binding can be a consequence of different abilities to bind to inaccessible chromatin I performed ATAC-seq in both cell lines. The analysis revealed a receptor-specific ability of GR to bind to closed chromatin which in turn directs GR-specific binding and gene regulation. Furthermore, to understand the effect of the sequence composition on differential binding, I compared the genomic loci that are selectively occupied by one of the receptors. Notably, GR showed a preference for GC-rich loci suggesting a role in local sequence composition in directing GR to its genomic binding sites and thereby contributing to GR-specific gene regulation. Remarkably, receptor-specific gene regulation was also observed near sites that are occupied by both receptors. A genomic deletion of these sites in their endogenous context indeed resulted in a loss of regulation of the nearby gene validating that these sites are essential for transcriptional activation. To investigate how the receptors direct differential gene regulation from shared binding sites I performed STARR-seq, an episomal reporter assay, and compared the activity of AR and GR at occupied genomic enhancers. I found receptor-specific enhancer activation at ...",

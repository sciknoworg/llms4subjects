                "A model of an assistance-system was built in an intensive and multilayered process of participatory software development in the context of a sheltered-workshop for disabled people. The solution is assisting people with learning disabilities to accomplish auton-omously their job tasks. Based on emotion-recognition and specific personalized profiles the system can recognize the cognitive abilities in a certain situation and assist to coop with problems by personalized feedback. Therefor the successful completion of a task is supported and the system can prevent failures and dangerous mistakes. As a result the experience of personal confidence and self-efficacy can be fostered. By a prototype the model could be evaluated and refined. The system consists of an authoring-area for designing personalized audio-visual work instructions and a mobile assistance area, that could easily be integrated in a production station. Because of the special needs of the target group and their vulnerability a adapted version of participatory software de-velopment process has to be initiated and applied."

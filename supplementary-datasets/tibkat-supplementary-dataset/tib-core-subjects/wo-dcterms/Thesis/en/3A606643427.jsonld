            "abstract": "Antimony, Iron, X-ray, Distabanes, Complexes. - The synthesis and spectroscopical characterization of catena-polystibanes are reported. Attempts to obtain their crystal structure by powder X-ray diffraction of the catena-polystibanes were made. Multinuclear organoantimony ironcarbonyl complexes were obtained by the reactions between tetraorganodistibanes and iron nonacarbonyl. The resulting complexes were investigated by spectroscopical methods and their crystal structure was determined by X-ray diffraction on single crystal. The reaction between tetraethyldistibane and cis-bis-piperidin molybden tetracarbonyl resulted in formation of a cyclic distibane complex. Trimethyl antimony and trimethyl bismuth complexes with sixth group metalcarbonyl fragments were prepared and characterized by spectroscopical and theoretical methods. Reactions between tetraorganodistibanes and bistrimethylsilylacetilene titanocene lead to the formation multinuclear clusters complexes with unusual crystal structures. Ionic organoantimony(V) compounds were synthesized and spectroscopically characterized.",

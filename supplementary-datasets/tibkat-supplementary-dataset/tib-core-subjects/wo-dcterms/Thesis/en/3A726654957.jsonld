            "abstract": "The space charge region in combination with the band edge profile is fundamental for the understanding of semiconductor physics. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) is a useful tool to investigate the band gap of a bulk semiconductor and the spatially resolved band edge profile of semiconductor interfaces on the nanometer scale. Space charge regions, which are formed at the interface of different semiconductor materials or at the tip-vacuum-semiconductor interface, are extracted from spectroscopy measurements. The space charge region of biased heterostructures is investigated, by introducing two contacts to the sample and applying an additional potential. The investigation of the space charge region of semiconductors is done by a bottom up approach from the ionization of single donors in a bulk semiconductor to the investigations of transport phenomena in a biased heterostructure sample. The bulk semiconductor is represented by Si doped GaAs, the heterostructure sample is a resonant tunneling diode consisting of two AlAs barrier separated by InAs quantum dots embedded in GaAs. The charging and discharging process of single silicon donors in GaAs is resolved on the nanometer scale. For a detailed description of the charging process, a simulation of the space charge region, which uses a homogeneous background charge, is combined with the Coulomb potential of a single donor. The advantage of the STM technique is the knowledge of the position of the donor in real space, as well as the charge state of this donor as a function of applied voltage ...",

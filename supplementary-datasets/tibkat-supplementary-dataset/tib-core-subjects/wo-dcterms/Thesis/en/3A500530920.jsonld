            "abstract": "The subject of this thesis is the asymptotic distribution of the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) statistic of hypotheses about the number of components in finite mixture models. Our starting point are the sufficient conditions for the existence of a limiting distribution of the LRT statistic for testing q against p components given by Dacunha-Castelle and Gassiat (1999). An analysis shows that these requirements do not hold, for instance, for \"simple\" mixtures of univariate normal distributions with heterogeneity of variances. After our modifications of the sufficient conditions given by Dacunha-Castelle and Gassiat (1999) a wider range of applications of their theory is offered. Additionally, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a limiting distribution of the LRT statistic for mixtures of general minimal exponential families. Afterwards we provide a set of various (new) examples for Gaussian-distributions, Gamma-distributions and discrete distributions possessing these properties. Our first modification offers testing for q against q+1 components of bivariate normal distributions with unknown (arbitrary) covariance matrix and our second modification offers testing homogeneity against a two population mixture of univariate normal distributions with heterogeneity of variances, if the component parameter space is suitably restricted. Finally, a method for simulating the quantiles the asymptotic distribution is introduced. Under the null hypothesis the LRT statistic converges in distribution to a supremum of a functional of a suitable Gaussian process, which we approximate with the aid of its final-dimensional marginal distributions. Considering as example a simple test of homogeneity of univariate normal distributions with unknown mean we give numerical results of this general method. In this context we introduce a modified spectral factorization on the resulting covariance matrix, whose outcome is a product of surprisingly low dimensional matrices and leads to considerably short computation times. A comparison of the power of the simulated asymptotic and exact quantiles shows that even for a small sample size the power is nearly the same.",

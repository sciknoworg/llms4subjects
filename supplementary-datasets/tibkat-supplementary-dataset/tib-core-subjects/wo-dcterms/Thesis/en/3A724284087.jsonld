            "title": "Synaptic vesicle recycling in vivo",
            "abstract": "The basic mechanism of neurotransmitter release at synapses is relatively well understood: upon arrival of an action potential, calcium influx into the nerve terminal triggers fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, resulting in the release of neurotransmitter from the vesicle interior into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter diffuses to the postsynaptic cell, where it binds its respective receptors and evokes a change in membrane potential. At the presynaptic side, the vesicle membrane is retrieved and refilled with neurotransmitter, in what is termed vesicle recycling. Surprisingly, synapses can contain up to half a million vesicles, most of which can be forced to undergo recycling under high frequency stimulation in many preparations in vitro. However, whether and how they are involved in neurotransmission in vivo is unknown. The aim of this project was therefore to determine the number of vesicles used by a living animal during a defined time period. Vesicle use in vivo was monitored by three different approaches: first, the fluorescent dye FM 1-43 was injected into a living animal, which was then allowed to behave freely for a defined amount of time, during which the dye was taken up by recycling vesicles. At the end of the observation period, the organ of interest was dissected and photo-oxidized, a procedure that allows for the identification and quantification of labelled vesicles by electron microscopy ...",

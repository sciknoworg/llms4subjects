            "abstract": "The integration of immigrants is an important topic not only for the immigrants but also for the whole German society. It is a target of all active players in society to achieve this goal to preserve the stability of the society and increase the harmony among the various ethnic groups of the society. In this work, a survey is conducted in various schools and children and youth promotion institutions in a German city, Kassel, to measure the level of the integration of adolescents with a Muslim or Arabic cultural background in German society. A quantitative-based approach is used for collecting the data for this work, i.e., questionnaire. The questionnaire covers various integration indicators at the four dimensions of integrations, i.e., cultural, structural, social and identification integration. The integration indicators are selected in accordance with the provincial-based Hessian integration monitor. This includes but is not limited to religious affiliation, language proficiency, family and friendship relationships, employment and educational situation, and satisfaction with life situation in Germany. These integration indicators are applied to both the parents and the adolescents with a Muslim or Arabic cultural background. Participation in social and sports activities is one of the main research topics in this work. The analysis of the collected data is performed using SPSS Statistics. To ensure the correctness of the analysis, various statistical techniques are used.",

            "abstract": "Mechanoluminescent (ML) materials, which generate light emission under mechanical stimulus, have attracted more and more attention in recent years due to their mechano-to-optical energy conversion capability. ML materials have been found to have huge potential in various field including force sensing, data storage and encryption, next generation lighting, and biomedical imaging. Most current research on ML is associated with conventional mechanical stimuli such as impact, friction and compression. Meanwhile, the field of contact-free ML is far less explored. To achieve remote mechanical loading for ML, ultrasound-induced stimulation is a promising candidate as an excitation source, which has already shown some advantages compared to more common contact-based mechanical stimuli. Moreover, utilizing ultrasound-specific benefits such as the possibility to penetrate tissue or to provide local heating, multifunctional smart materials can be further developed based on ultrasound-induced mechanoluminescence (USML). Therefore, the main objectives of this work were to investigate USML characteristics and explore its potential application. In this work, CaZnOS and ZnGa2O4 have been selected as the host materials for in-depth USML investigation. The superiority of CaZnOS comes from its crystal structure: the Zn-site and Ca-site can be substituted by transition metal ions (Mn2+, Cu+, etc.) and rare earth ions (Er3+, Nd3+, Tb3+, etc.), which not only enables ML emission in a broad spectral range, but also provides possibilities for other rare-earth related applications, e.g., optical thermometry. Besides the ML property, ZnGa2O4 is also commonly used as an embedded phase in glass-ceramics and glass-ceramics composites. Glass-ceramic materials containing ZnGa2O4 microcrystals allow for glass-like processing of the ML compound, which breaks the typical constraints on its bulk processability.",

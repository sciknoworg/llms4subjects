            "abstract": "Product properties of nanoparticulate systems can be influenced to great extent by means of variation of different parameters like size, shape or composition. With this, manifold optimization potential on the way from the production to the final product exists for product design. Thereby, the control and determination of disperse particle properties during the different process steps is a major challenge. Especially, the determination of multidimensional particle size distributions or the correlation of disperse optical and geometrical or structural particle properties via conventional characterization methods are limited. Mainly, this is due to ensemble measurements, necessary sample preparation and the incapability of linking several different properties within a single measurement. Main aspects of these challenges can be mastered using the fractionating method of analytical ultracentrifugation. There, major progress could be made by further developing the extinction-based analytical ultracentrifugation. However, further advancements for the method are possible for the combined optical and hydrodynamic analysis of nanoparticles. Examplarily, the characterization of anisotropic particles is limited. This is due to the fact that from the distribution of sedimentation velocities of nanorods, it is a priori not possible to deduce length and diameter distributions. In this thesis, it will be shown how the two-dimensional particle size distributions of gold nanorods can be deduced by a simultaneous analysis of the extinction spectra and the associated sedimentation velocity. This procedure is possible as the measured optical and the hydrodynamic properties of the nanorods depend on size and anisotropy. Besides the analysis of various influencing factors and measurement results, possibilities for the estimation of the transferability of the method to other particle systems are presented. Beyond enhanced analysis and modeling of measured data, hardware developments provide further possibilities of linked particle ...",

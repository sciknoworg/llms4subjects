            "abstract": "The SP-PLP-EPR technique has been developed for very detailed kinetic investigations into radical polymerization. The method which combines single-pulse-pulsed-laser-polymerization (SP-PLP) with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) allows for direct online monitoring of radical concentration with a time-resolution of \u00ecs after applying an intense laser SP. Polymerizations have been carried out at ambient pressure within a broad temperature range in bulk and in solutions, including water and ionic liquids as solvents. SP-PLP-EPR provides access to the highly complex diffusion-controlled termination kinetics of radicals as a function of chain-length during polymerization. A unique feature of the method is that different types of radicals may be followed independently. Kinetic fitting of measured concentration vs. time traces via PREDICI\u00ae simulation yields reliable rate coefficients. Monitoring of midchain radicals formed via backbiting of chain-end radicals in acrylic acid and acrylate polymerizations allows for studying intramolecular transfer and individual termination steps of both species. Tracing of propagating and of intermediate radicals during reversible addition fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization provides access to RAFT addition, fragmentation and to termination reactions. By directly measuring the lifetime of the intermediate radical during dithiobenzoate-mediated acrylate polymerization, a reliable fragementation rate coefficient has been determined which value excludes the so-called slow-fragementation from explaining rate retardation. SP-PLP-EPR in the presence of copper(II)-complexes is suitable for measuring deactivation rate coefficients during atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) ...",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Erythropoietin (Epo), a hematopoietic growth factor, has long been observed to improve cognition but this effect was attributed to the increase in hemoglobin levels. Even after the discovery of Epo and Epo receptor (EpoR) in brain, it lasted for years until potential direct Epo effects on the brain were explored by in vivo experiments. A large number of preclinical studies followed, essentially devoted to employment of Epo as a neuroprotective agent. Ultimately, clinical trials on patients with schizophrenia or chronic progressive multiple sclerosis as well as on extremely preterm infants, all demonstrating improved cognitive outcome upon Epo treatment, particularly of speed of processing/short-term memory, strongly suggested to consider this growth factor as an important player in neuroplasticity and higher cognition. It was thus hypothesized that a respective relevance of the Epo/EpoR system would also be reflected by genetic variations within the encoding genes (EPO and EPOR). Methods: For addressing this hypothesis, the GRAS (G\u00f6ttingen Research Association for Schizophrenia) data collection was used, providing a thus far unique ground for phenotype-based genetic association studies (PGAS). GRAS comprises >1000 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV. DNA samples of GRAS patients were genotyped for genetic polymorphisms of the EPO and EPOR genes. For the subsequent statistical analyses, age, antipsychotic medication, negative symptoms, and duration of disease were used as covariates ...",

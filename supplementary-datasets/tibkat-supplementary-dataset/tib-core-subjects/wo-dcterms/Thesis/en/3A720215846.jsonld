            "abstract": "Lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) is a pleiotropic 25-kDa secretory protein, currently used as a biomarker for renal injury and inflammation. Its serum level is increased under different pathological conditions but the source and cause are unclear. The aim of our study was to prospectively evaluate the LCN-2 expression in different pathological conditions. The objective of our study was to determine LCN-2 expression in a rat and mouse model of sterile abscess and in a model of rat liver and lung exposed to single dose x-irradiation as oxidative stress is induced in both models. The current study compares LCN-2 gene expression with known major acute phase proteins in the liver in a rat and mouse model of turpentine-oil (TO)- induced sterile abscess. Furthermore, it shows that serum Lipocalin-2 is a potential Biomarker of radiation damage of liver but not lung. Serum LCN-2 concentrations increased dramatically up to 200-fold (20 \u00e6g/ml) at 48h after TO-injection. A strong elevation of LCN-2 mRNA in rat liver was observed starting from 4h up to 48h after injection, with a maximum (8738\u00b12104-fold) at 24h, which was further confirmed by Western blot analysis. In contrast, the increases in gene expression of a2-macroglobulin (a2M), the major acute phase protein and hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1), a positive acute phase protein were only 1025\u00b1505 and 47\u00b112-fold respectively during acute-phase- response. No considerable change was observed in LCN-2 mRNA in rat kidney and other organs as compared to liver ...",

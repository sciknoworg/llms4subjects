            "abstract": "Synaptic inhibition is vital to brain function. GABAergic and glycinergic synapses, mediating fast inhibition in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), balance the activity of neural circuits. At the inhibitory postsynapse, GABA and glycine receptors accumulate around a scaffold composed of the protein Gephyrin, which is recruited to sites apposed to GABA or glycine releasing terminals through interaction with Neuroligin 2 (NL2), a member of the Neuroligin family of synaptic adhesion molecules that function as powerful synapse organizers. Another Gephyrin-binding molecule, Collybistin, regulates this recruitment process, functioning as a switch that is activated at sites of NL2 accumulation, leading to tethering of Gephyrin scaffold to the postsynaptic membrane and allowing the subsequent clustering of receptors at sites of transmitter release. Despite the well-documented studies about the critical role of Collybistin in the development of synaptic inhibition, the mechanism of Collybistin function has not yet been clearly identified. In the present study, a structure-function analysis on Collybistin, which was followed by protein-lipid interaction assays, led to the identification of two crucial molecular mechanisms: a conformational switch in Collybistin induced by NL2 binding and subsequent membrane tethering of Gephyrin-Collybistin complex via protein-lipid interactions. These data allow formulation of a coherent molecular model of the assembly of inhibitory synapses and covers a gap in our understanding of the development of synaptic inhibition in the mammalian CNS.",

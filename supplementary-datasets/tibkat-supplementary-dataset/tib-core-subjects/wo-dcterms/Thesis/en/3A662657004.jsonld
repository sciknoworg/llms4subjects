            "abstract": "A novel method for spectral analysis of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals is presented. This method provides a general solution for donor quenching and acceptor sensitization related apparent FRET efficiencies and corrected total concentration of donor and acceptor molecules present in the sample. Furthermore, fluorescence from both free and interacting donor and acceptor molecules is considered. All corrections for excitation crosstalk and/or emission bleed-through are inherent in the method. Implementation to spectroscopy demonstrates the possibility to identify and correct two of the most common sources of artifacts in FRET measurements, photobleaching and fluorophore protonation. Further application demonstrates the use of this method to quantitatively evaluate intermolecular interaction. In this method&rsquo;s application to microscopy, the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the measurements and propagation of photon shot noise is also considered. Models are developed to characterize the SNR as a function of the number of photons detected and are used to optimize the efficiency of photon use. This method is used to measure dynamic changes in [cAMP] using an EPAC-based FRET sensor. The ability to predict the SNR during the photobleaching as well as changes in FRET efficiency over such dynamic measurement is demonstrated.",

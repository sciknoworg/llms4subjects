            "abstract": "The fatality of the tick-transmitted Theileria parva infections in cattle heavily impacts farmers in sub-Saharan Africa who depend on livestock for subsistence. Infection prevention by tick control relying on acaricides is expensive and unsustainable, while cattle vaccination by the infection and treatment\" is marred by 'breakthrough' infections in some areas within eastern Africa - where cattle share pasture grazing lands with wild Cape buffaloes. While it is known that buffalo-maintained parasites are diversely heterogeneous than cattle-maintained parasites, there is still a scarcity of parasite genotype data from wildlife-livestock interface areas. Moreover, a definitive genetic basis for differentiating cattle- and buffalo-derived parasites from such co-grazed areas is yet forthcoming. In addressing the two foregoing aspects, this thesis describes studies in which parasite genotypes based on the T. parva sporozoite surface antigen (p67) and the CD8+ antigen Tp2 genes were compared between Tanzanian and Kenyan wildlife-livestock interface areas. In addition, heterogeneity patterns of thirteen full-length near-complete T. parva mitogenomes from East and Southern Africa T. parva strains were examined. In the first set of analyses, T. parva-parasites antigen genes amplified from buffaloes, vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle from wildlife-livestock areas of northern Tanzania where vaccine 'breakthrough' have not been reported \u2013 despite the presence of Cape buffaloes, were compared against parasites in vaccinated cattle exposed to buffalo-derived T. parva challenge in central Kenya \u2013 where vaccine 'breakthroughs' have been reported. The analysis revealed additional epitope variants within the Tp2 antigen genes amplified from Tanzanian buffaloes, which adds to the evidence of parasite heterogeneity within the buffalo population. Moreover, a buffalo type p67 (allele 4), an allele reported in South Africa but is rare among East African isolates studied thus far, was identified in Tanzania, while p67 alleles (2 and ...\"",

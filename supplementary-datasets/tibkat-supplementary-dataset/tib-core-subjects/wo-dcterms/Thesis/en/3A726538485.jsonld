            "abstract": "Genetic studies focus on the identification of genetic variants in association with development of disease. Recently, there has been special interest in predicting outcomes based on genetic risk scores and interest in classification of patients into different risk levels of disease probability. The evaluation of models for prediction requires an extra independent dataset to be used as testing data, which is not always available. The 0.632 estimator is a good alternative to overcome this problem. We adapted the Schoenfeld residuals as a criterion to measure prediction errors in a Cox regression model for survival data and combined it with the 0.632 estimator. Based on this adapted estimator we formulated an R-squared measure for prediction (R2-pred) to estimate the gain in prediction due to predictors in the model. We evaluated the performance of our approach through simulation studies with genetic variants as predictors of survival outcome. We compared the R2-pred estimates with that obtained from use of independent validation data. In addition, we compared our approach with that of the Brier score. We found that estimates of R2-pred based on the 0.632 estimator and on Schoenfeld residuals have the best performance among the other competitors. The 0.632 estimator approximates best the expected R2-pred value of a Cox model, and the Schoenfeld residuals allow better differentiation of the gain in prediction of the outcome. We present an application to a clinical-genetic study on stem cell transplantation, with focus on evaluation of the prediction capability of risk score levels for death after transplantation.",

            "abstract": "Cloud computing is a paradigm for using IT services with characteristics such as flexible and scalable service usage, on-demand availability, and pay-as-you-go billing. Respective services are called cloud services and their nature usually motivates a differentiation in three layers: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for cloud services offering functionality of hardware resources in a virtualised way, Platform as a Service (PaaS) for services acting as execution platforms, and Software as a Service (SaaS) representing applications provided in a cloud computing way. Any of these services is offered with the illusion of unlimited scalability. The infinity gained by this illusion implies the need for some kind of regulation mechanism to manage sup- ply and demand. Today's static pricing mechanisms are limited in their capabilities to adapt to dynamic characteristics of cloud environments such as changing workloads. The solution is a dynamic pricing approch compareable to today's exchanges. This requires comparability of cloud services and the need of standardised access to avoid vendor lock-in. To achieve comparability, a classification for cloud services is introcuced, where classes of cloud services representing tradable goods are expressed by the minimum requirements for a certain class. The main result of this work is a framework for exchange-based trading of cloud computing commodities, which is composed of four core components derived from existing exchange market places. An exchange component takes care of accepting orders from buyers and sellers and determines the price for the goods. A clearing component is responsible for the financial closing of a trade. The settlement component takes care of the delivery of the cloud service. A rating component monitors cloud services and logs service level agreement breaches to calculate provider ratings, especially for reliability, which is an important factor in cloud computing. The framework establishes a new basis for using cloud services and more advanced business models. Additionally, an overview of selected economic aspects including ideas for derivative financial instruments like futures, options, insurances, and more complex ones is provided. A first version of the framework is currently being implemented and in use at Deutsche Bo r\u034f\u0308se Cloud Exchange AG.",

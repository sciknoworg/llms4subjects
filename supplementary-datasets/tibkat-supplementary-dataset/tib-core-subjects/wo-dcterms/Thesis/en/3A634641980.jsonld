            "abstract": "Nematoden, Lektine, Larvendifferenzierung. - To maximise growth, fecundity and animal health of livestock, it is important to understand, control and manage nematode parasite burdens. A central issue regarding infection of livestock with gastrointestinal parasites is the degree of contamination of pasture with the infectious larval stages of these nematodes, often referred to as larval challenge. Assessing the degree of larval challenge is essential in managing the degree of infection in grazing animals. Traditionally it has been difficult to assess the pasture contamination for two reasons: firstly because of the difficulty of identification and differentiation of nematode larvae and secondly, because of poor and inconsistent recovery of these larvae of pasture. Both problems were addressed by using a panel of 19 lectins to differentiate L3 of H. contortus and T. circumcincta and by modifying the Baermann method as a recovery method of larvae from grass. When counted numbers of larvae were incubated on grass, recovery was most consistent when the incubation period was extended to 48 hours, which resulted in recovery of larvae of 55 % (CV 7 %). Lectin binding to the surface of L3 of both species was weak, patchy and inconsistent. Sheathed larvae could be distinguished by AAL binding to the head of H. contortus only. Exsheathed larvae did not show any binding to the surface, but binding to the mouth region, amphids and phasmids was more consistent. Exsheathed L3 could be differentiated by binding of BGS I to the head of H. contortus only. In comparison to L3, other life cycle stages like eggs and adults showed intense lectin binding and could be distinguished easily.  When the two methods were combined and a mixed population of H. contortus and T. circumcincta were placed in grass, 53 % of larvae could be recovered with Baermann separation and the H. contortus distinguished by AAL binding.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing research to fight cancer, one of the dominant diseases of the 21st century has led to big progress especially when it comes to understanding the tumor growth and metastasis. This includes the discovery of the molecular mechanisms of tumor vascularization, which is critically required for establishment of tumor metastasis. Formation of new blood vessels is the first step in tumor vascularization. Therefore, understanding the molecular and cellular basis of tumor vascularization attracted a significant effort studying in biomedical research. The blood vessels for supplying tumor can be formed by sprouting from pre-existing vessels, a process called angiogenesis, or by vasculogenesis, that is de novo formation of blood vessels from not fully differentiated progenitor cell populations. Vasculogenic endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can either be activated from populations in the bone marrow reaching the pathological region via the circulation or they can be recruited from local reservoirs. Neovessel formation influences tumor progression, hence therapeutic response model systems of angiogenesis/vasculogenesis are necessary to study the underlying mechanisms. Although, initially the research in this area focused more on angiogenesis, it is now well understood that both angiogenesis and postnatal vasculogenesis contribute to neovessel formation in adult under both most pathological as well as physiological conditions. Studies in the last two decades demonstrate that in addition to the intimal layer of fully differentiated mature endothelial cells (ECs) and various smaller supplying vessels (vasa vasorum) that can serve as a source for new vessels by angiogenesis, especially the adventitia of large and medium size blood vessels harbors various vascular wall-resident stem and progenitor cells (VW-SPCs) populations that serve as a source for new vessels by postnatal vasculogenesis. However, little is known about the potential role of VW-SPCs in tumor vascularization. To this end, the present work started first ...",

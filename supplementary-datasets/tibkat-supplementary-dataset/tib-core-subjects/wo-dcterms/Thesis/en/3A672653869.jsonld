            "abstract": "Brassica napus L., a plant that belongs to the Brassicaceae family is one of the main oil crops. Inside its seeds glucosinolates appear to be the main secondary glycoside, sugar containing component with sulfur containing bindings. Plant breeders have tried to lower the glucosinolate levels of seeds of rapeseed so that the high-protein seed meal remaining after oil extraction can be used as animal food. Products such as the nitriles and isothiocyanates are toxic components. Some of the glucosinolate types or alkenyles have negative effects in animal nutrition such as progoitrin. Very little is known about the function and roles of glucosinolates in the vegetative tissue of flowering winter rapeseed. The decomposition products are possibly inhibiting for bacteria in fermentation processes, caused by the very reactive side chains, released after cleavage with the myrosinase enzyme. The main objectives were to explore and define the genetic basis of the synthesis of glucosinolates in the green matter of oilseed rape and their effect on biogas production, to investigate the genetic variation of the glucosinolate contents and pattern in the vegetative tissue in classical breeding  ...",

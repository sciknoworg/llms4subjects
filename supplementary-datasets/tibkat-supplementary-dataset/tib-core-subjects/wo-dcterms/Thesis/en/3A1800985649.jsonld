            "title": "The functional role of the Death-associated protein kinase 1 in the colorectal carcinogenesis",
            "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed malignancy worldwide. Development of metastasis predominantly in liver and lung is the fatal leading cause of death and a serious obstacle of curing CRC. Recently, it has been shown that Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) might be a potential candidate regulating metastasis in CRC. DAPK1 as an actin filament-associated calcium/calmodulin-regulated, stress-responsive serine/threonine kinase was reported to be an extremely pleiotropic molecule due to its unique multi-domain structure. It is postulated that main action modes for metastasis suppression by DAPK1 might exist: the increase in susceptibility of tumor cells to apoptotic signals, inhibitory role on integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration and modulation of tumor microenvironment. This doctoral thesis aimed to shed more light into the functional role of the tumor suppressor DAPK1 in CRC aggressiveness. As an in vitro tool, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was applied to generate HCT116 cell lines with stable DAPK1 knockout (ko). The phenotype of DAPK1 lacking cells was described and a novel DAPK1-mediated gene expression network associated with metastatic potential of colorectal tumors was identified. Further, the effect of DAPK1 ko on tumoral growth was examined using the avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and a conditional ko mouse DAPK1\u2206IEC1d/1d. Interestingly, this work revealed increased tumor budding and metastatic potential when DAPK1 was lost in tumors supporting its role as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, this study firstly proposes that the DAPK1-ERK1/2 axis might be involved in metastasis suppression. Loss of adhesion molecule ICAM1, gain in TACSTD2 expression, and increased tumor cell-ECM interaction under DAPK1 loss seem to be central events in this process. Moreover, preliminary results of an AOM/DSS\u2013induced colorectal tumorigenesis model suggest that DAPK1 could play a functional role in promoting tumor-associated inflammation and angiogenesis. This work suggests ...",

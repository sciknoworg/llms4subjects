            "abstract": "Coxiella burnetii is a Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of the zoonotic disease Q fever. Humans are infected through the inhalation of contaminated aerosols. Once inhaled, alveolar macrophages are the first line of defense against inhaled C. burnetii. Infected individuals can be asymptomatic or can develop a flu-like illness, atypical pneumonia or even hepatitis. Apart from acute Q fever, around 2-5% of C. burnetii infected humans will develop chronic Q fever, which mainly manifests as endocarditis years after exposure to the pathogen. Treatments of chronic Q fever are inefficient and harsh, as a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine is applied for 12 months. Therefore, the establishment of new therapies is inevitable, presumably therapies that prevent persistence of the pathogen in the first place. Yet, details about how C. burnetii escapes the immune system and persists for years inside the host are not established. Here, we examined the role of oxygen in C. burnetii replication and persistence. Indeed, C. burnetii replication is not possible in hypoxic macrophages, while C. burnetii replicates in normoxic macrophages. Of note, C. burnetii stays viable under hypoxia. The reason behind the impairment of replication is not lack of maturation of the Coxiella-containing vacuole (CCV) or changes in phagocytic uptake between normoxia and hypoxia. However, hypoxia-induced HIF1\u03b1 stabilization contributes to the replication defect in hypoxic macrophages. Thus, HIF1\u03b1 stabilization leads to reduced Stat3 phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus. As a result, impairment of C. burnetii replication is caused by HIF1\u03b1-induced Stat3 inhibition. Moreover, HIF1\u03b1 and Stat3 are involved in the regulation of the TCA cycle, including citrate. Therefore, the importance of citrate was analyzed for intracellular C. burnetii. Indeed, intracellular citrate levels are lower in hypoxic macrophages as compared to normoxic macrophages. This is regulated by the HIF1\u03b1-Stat3 axis. In ...",

            "abstract": "Within this research the combined evaluation of different types of historical photos for the documentation of cultural heritage sites is discussed. For this purpose the historical photos of Baalbek in Lebanon have been used which can be classified into three types: vertical, oblique and terrestrial photos. Due to the poor properties of these photos (such as: different cameras used and no primary data of cameras&rsquo; parameters, different image scales, different altitudes of the flight, the contrast of the gray values and the image noise are relative high, in addition the images had been taken in different dates, etc.), it is not a priori clear by which combination of the image orientation process the best results (namely, the accurate determination of camera parameters) could be achieved. Therefore, an approach for the relative orientation process will be discussed. Since the relative orientation is the position recovery and orientation of one image system relative to another, the potential of the mentioned approach is to reveal (from a mathematical point of view) the direct and indirect impact between the historical images of Baalbek to each other. It can be considered as a new contribution for the image orientation process based on the combination of different image types. This approach consists of three steps; the first one is the orientation of each image type in a separated block with its special properties (e.g. for each type a special camera was assumed). Second, the orientation process only for the vertical and oblique photos together has been achieved. Finally, all types of historic Baalbek's photos have been assembled into the same block and then oriented ...",

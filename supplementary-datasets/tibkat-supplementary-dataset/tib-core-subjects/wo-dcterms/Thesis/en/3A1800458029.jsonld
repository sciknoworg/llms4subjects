In this thesis, the formation of nitrous oxide is reported upon initial (electro)chemical dinitrogen splitting into nucleophilic Rhenium nitride complexes and subsequent nitride-NO coupling. The overall comproportionation of N2 and NO to N2O is investigated with spectroscopic methods and theoretical calculations and revealed a formal \"umpolung\" of the Rhenium nitride complex upon initial NO coordination.$yLinzenz",

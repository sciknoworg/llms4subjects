            "abstract": "Zusammenassung: In today\u2019s IT-driven world, programming skills are indispensable for engineers.While there are different approaches to teaching students how to code, it is usefulregardless to have meaningful data on student performance, for example in orderto determine early on which students could benefit from extra help. At the ThayerSchool of Engineering, we have developed a platform- independent in-browserprogramming environment which allows students to focus on the basics ofprogramming without the distractions of having to deal with complicated editorsor servers. This environment is additionally linked to students\u2019 accounts and canbe embedded in our Learning Management System, where students mustcomplete daily assignments. All data of the students\u2019 interactions with theplatform are captured, resulting in a unique data set from a full on-campusintroductory programming course. Based on this data set, we evaluated variousmetrics that quantify a student\u2019s error compilation behavior and showed that theycan be implemented in a different context and be of use as students\u2019 performancemetrics. In addition, we found out that small programming assignments whichcover the basic concepts of programming are essential for students\u2019 success.Linked to these assignments, we present two metrics which show that studentswho spend more time on average on these assignments, as well as solve fewerassignments, are more likely to perform worse on the course. In combination withthe error compilation metrics, we built multiple regression models that performedsuperior to individual models. Furthermore, we implemented machine learningalgorithms that could accurately predict at-risk students with up to seven days ofintervention time left before the first midterm exam. Based on our results, we canshow that a data-driven analysis in an introductory programming course can beutilized to assist both, students that are struggling to pass the course andeducators in getting insights on student learning.",

            "abstract": "Making voluntary goal-directed arm movements is a basic ability of all primates. This act seems to be very simple - almost trivial - to us, but it involves a complex translation of sensory information into muscle activation patterns. It is not only interesting how we plan to reach an object but also how we combine and represent information about our environment and our internal states to form a decision to do so. The following work consists of three scientific articles and one submitted manuscript, which addresses the question how reach planning is accomplished by the brain. The model system that was used to answer this question was the behaving macaque monkey. To investigate the complex system of reach planning extracellular activity was recorded from neurons in two distinct cortical areas, the parietal reach region (PRR) and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), while the animals performed a behavioral task. A computational model was developed in accordance with findings from the electrophysiological recordings, which was then used to interpret the recorded data and to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to the findings.",

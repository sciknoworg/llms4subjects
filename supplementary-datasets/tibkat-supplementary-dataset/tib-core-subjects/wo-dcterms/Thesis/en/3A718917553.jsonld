            "abstract": "This thesis, meant to be an intercultural comparison of social policy, provides a systematic exploration of institutionalized, free and reduced cost psycho-social counseling concerning general life issues in Bremen and Columbus, Ohio. The main aspects of the comparison are: type and amount of counseling services available, financing, target group, training level of counselors, and access hurdles to the counseling process. The comparison shows significant structural differences that can be traced back to the differing functions of the counseling system in each country. After a detailed description of the current state of both systems a direct comparison of many structural elements of counseling in each city is provided which eventually demonstrates the strengths and deficiencies of each system. The benchmarking process is to show how the effectiveness of the one system could be used as a model for improving the other system. While free counseling services in Bremen are (still) available to all social groups and persons, in Ohio they are available only for those needy who can prove financial need through complicated and extensive procedures. The provision of free general life counseling for all social groups by the general public (country, state or county) does not exist in either country (exept for children and teenagers in Germany). All services provided are based on the initiative of non-profit agencies, many of which, especially in Germany, are linked to the church or religious institutions. It is shown that the system in Ohio, in contrast to that in Germany, is significantly affected by local and state government, especially by the rules and guidelines of the quasi-governmental Community Mental Health Boards (ADAMHs)). At the same time counseling agencies in Ohio are forced to operate almost like a private business in order to stay in the market, be competitive and financially viable. This is unlike any of the agencies in Bremen. That is why there are two main aspects of work in agencies in Ohio: to be efficient and to help those in need; whereas in can be said that in Bremen only the latter is the center of work. In the end the enormous social effect of early psycho-social intervention (maintenance of psychological health and well-being for a wide range of social groups as well as national economic advantages) is demonstrated and linked to the call for acknowledgement of general life counseling as a meaningful method of prevention by those responsible for social policy.",

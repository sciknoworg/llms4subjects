            "abstract": "The increase in bandwidth, the number of internet users and the variety of internet applications, all point towards the need for adaptive and flexible internet protocols. Alternatively, they also emphasize on the necessity for specialized protocols that cater to application requirements. Current Transport protocols such as TCP and UDP are not flexible enough to be used by applications which differ in their performance expectations. UDP, for example, is inelastic in nature and therefore can cause exacerbation of congestion in an already congested network. TCP on the other hand was designed to provide proportional fairness, such that a ``flow'' is the unit which is allocated resources. This not only results in all flows having an equal share at the bandwidth irrespective of the application requirements, but also give way to a new trend of applications that are able to take advantage of the ``flow-oriented'' fairness. Delay-insensitive applications, such as P2P file sharing, generate substantial amounts of traffic and compete with other applications on an equal footing while using TCP. Further, to optimize throughput, such applications open multiple connections. This results in an unfair and potentially poor service for applications having stringent performance objectives. The main part of this thesis proposes NF-TCP, a TCP variant for P2P and similar background delay-insensitive applications ...",

            "title": "Fine root dynamics and resource uptake in a South Ecuadorian mountain rainforest as dependent on elevation",
            "abstract": "Tropical mountain rainforests extend over large elevational gradients with diverse climatic conditions. They are characterised by a decrease of above ground biomass, and a pronounced increase of fine root biomass with increasing elevation. Forest stands at higher elevations are further characterised by thick organic layers and very moist soil conditions. The turnover of fine roots plays an important role in the cycling of carbon and nutrients in theses ecosystems. However, the knowledge about the patterns of fine root dynamics in tropical mountain rainforests is still scarce. Likewise, not much is known about water and nutrient uptake capacities of roots at different elevations. The present study was conducted in five forests stands along an elevational transect between 1050 and 3060 m asl in a mountain rainforest of South Ecuador. It aimed (1) to analyse the effect of temperature and soil conditions on fine root turnover along the elevational transect by means of minirhizotrons; (2) to assess the role of nutrient limitation and water-logging for fine root activity by means of a fertilization and throughfall exclusion experiment, respectively; as well as to examine nitrogen uptake capacity of fine roots by 15N tracer application; and (3) to investigate the dependence of root sap flow on environmental variables by means of miniature heat balance sap flow gauges, and to analyse related anatomical characteristics of root cross sections ...",

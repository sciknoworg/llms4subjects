            "title": "Subcellular localization of Kv10.1 (Eag1): functional ion channels on the inner nuclear membrane",
            "abstract": "hEag1 (human ether-a-go-go-1, Kv10.1) is a voltage-gated potassium channel expressed mostly in the brain in healthy subjects but also in many tumors under pathological conditions. Its ability to induce malignant transformation and to favour tumor progression can&rsquo;t be attributed entirely to its potassium permeation. hEag1 was shown to co-localize with lamin A/C. And electron microscopy studies in neurons and tumor cells indicated that it is localized at the inner nuclear membrane. The aim of the thesis was to con?rm this localization. The peri-nuclear hEag1 ful?ls the established criteria for transmembrane proteins targeted to the inner nuclear membrane. The peri-nuclear hEag1 was not accessible to antibodies unless the nuclear envelope was permeabilized. Compared to the cytoplasm population, the peri-nuclear population was more resistant to Triton X-100 extraction and less mobile in lateral di?usion in FRAP analysis. It was also frequently found in the \u02baNPC-free island\u02ba, which normally associates with the heterochromatin. All these characters suggest a tight interaction with nuclear lamina, other inner nuclear membrane proteins or chromatin. Furthermore, in density gradient  centrifugation of extracts from both heterologous and native systems, hEag1 was enriched in fractions containing known inner nuclear membrane proteins. It was also shown that hEag1 at the inner nuclear membrane is functional as an ion channel. Single channel currents detected at the inner nuclear membrane were compatible with that of hEag1 in terms of conductance and pharmacologic properties (inhibition by astemizole and a speci?c monoclonal antibody). This current was not detected in non-transfected cells. Moreover, the opening probability was higher when the pipette voltage was more negative, suggesting that hEag1 in the inner nuclear membrane has its N and C termini facing the nucleoplasm. Our experiments strongly suggest that the channel is integrated in the inner nuclear membrane, with its N and C-termini exposed to the nucleoplasm, possibly in contact with the heterochromatin.",

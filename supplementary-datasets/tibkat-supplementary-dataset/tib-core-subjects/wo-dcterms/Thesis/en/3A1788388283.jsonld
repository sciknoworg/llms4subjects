            "abstract": "Material science includes the characterisation of the physical behaviour as well as the development of novel structures and material compositions. These interrelating aspects are connected by the structure-property relationship, which describes the direct correlation of the microstructure and the functional properties. Facing the challenges of scarcity of fossil energies give rise to rethink on traditional energy generation. In order to fulfil the increasing demand for renewable energy sources and energy efficient solutions, sustainable technologies based on innovative materials with outstanding properties are needed. Therefore, novel nanomaterials are required, which push the limits of the material performance as far as possible and provide cutting-edge technical functionalities. One example of such a nanomaterial are percolated nanowire networks which are used as flexible and transparent electrodes. The device performance crucially depends on the electrical and mechanical properties of the single nanowires. Correlative microscopy in combination with in situ testing is key to characterise the microstructure on small length scales and to further interlink it with the functional properties. Corresponding to the emerging field of nanowire research, this work gives some novel insights into the growth behaviour, functional properties as well as the application-related sensing functionality of single nanowires. The nanowire study is based on correlative in situ light and electron microscopy, which enables a scale-bridging analysis in different environments and length scales. The first part of the thesis has the focus on the growth behaviour of transition metal oxide nanowires. In general, the microstructure of nanowires depends on the growth mechanism and the synthesis routine. Hence, it is of great interest to control and further directly influence the growing nanostructures. The growth of molybdenum dioxide nanowires can be observed within an in situ heating stage in the light microscope. The direct correlation of ...",

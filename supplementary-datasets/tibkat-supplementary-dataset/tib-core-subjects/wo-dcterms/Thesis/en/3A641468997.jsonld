            "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni, an important food-borne human bacterial pathogen in industrialized countries and in the developing world, the leading cause of bacterial diarrhoea. The infection may be accompanied by fever and abdominal cramps and, as a post-infection complication, in rare cases Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome might emerge. In contrast, C. jejuni is only a commensal in poultry, where the pathogen predominantly resides in the cecum which contains many anaerobic fermentative bacteria. Within these natural habitats, C. jejuni is able to metabolize products like free amino and keto acids that have been generated by these bacterial species or from the host himself. In order to identify genes which are related to the invasion of host cells by the pathogen, 660 clones of a transposon mutant library generated in the clinical C. jejuni isolate B2 were screened. Thereby, a clone with a transposon insertion in gene cj0952c was identified. As in the sequenced C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168, the respective protein together with the gene product of adjacent gene cj0951c consists of two transmembrane domains, a HAMP domain followed by C-terminal putative MCP domain together believed to act as a chemoreceptor, designated as Tlp7. This thesis describes that genes cj0952c and cj0951c are important for the invasion of host cells by the pathogen ...",

            "abstract": "As one of well-established plant model systems, Nicotiana attenuata has been intensively researched in plant resistance/tolerance, plant physiology and interactions with other environmental components in the last two decades. Although root systems, hidden belowground, are much harder to study than other organs, considering their importance in dynamic regulation of plant physiology, morphology, biochemistry, flowering and synthesis of metabolites, and their rich environmental interactions, the exploration of root responses to abiotic and biotic factors in N. attenuata will help to better understand mechanisms of how plants cope with multifaceted environmental factors. Smoke cues are long-live chemical signals in native habitats which play important roles in many aspects for N.attenuata plants, for example by promoting seed germination. Roots are likely exposed to smoke cues in the soil, but how roots respond to such chemical cues was poorly understand. We observed clear root developmental defects in primary root and root hair elongation with liquid smoke incubation. Bioassay-guided fractionation allowed us to obtain the active compound (catechol) responsible for these root defects. Amongst many root growth regulators, comparative transcriptomics narrowed them down to auxin and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathwaysAuxin was excluded as the main regulator to mediate smokeinduced root morphilogical alteration. Extenal catechol application caused a spatial disruption of H2O2 accumulation, although no bulk quantitative differences. Such misslocation of H2O2 is likely responsible for root defects caused by catechol, which can be partially recovered by H2O2 supplementation that suggested catechol is the main regulator in smoke leads to the smokemediated root defects. Further investigation demonstared the exsistence of catechol in burned areas in the native habitat of Utah, indicating possible ecological functions of smoke cues tuning root growth in nature. ...",

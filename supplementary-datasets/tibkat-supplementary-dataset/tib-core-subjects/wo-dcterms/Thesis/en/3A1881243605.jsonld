            "abstract": "The understanding of the responses of plant populations to plant community diversity is still incomplete. While the link between plant community diversity and biomass production is already well studied, the one between community diversity and plant longevity and life cycle is not. Especially longevity was deemed to be an unfeasible measurement for herbaceous plants species, because the usual methods were disproportionately time-consuming. Furthermore, researchers did not expect longevity to be of interest for herbaceous plants. This thesis shows that growth ring analysis is a suitable and fast method to analyse longevity of herbaceous plants and gives results that are scientifically relevant. Therefore, this method facilitates the understanding of plant population responses. The life cycle of populations and longevity both belong to the topic of life history schedules. Just as age and the life cycle of herbaceous species it is hardly studied. This is the knowledge gap this thesis tries to fill. Disentangling the effects of environmental influences and biodiversity on age and life cycle in natural settings is difficult and sometimes impossible, as both are highly correlated. Therefore, this was conducted in the Jena Experiment. It offers a unique framework to study the influence of plant community diversity in a controlled setting, therefore this thesis was done within this experiment. When the samples were taken, the Jena Experiment had been running for twelve years, sufficient time for the plant population dynamics to develop in herbaceous species. The longevity was determined in 1664 individuals from all available herbaceous plant species in the Jena Experiment. They were harvested including the oldest tissue, which is located depending on the growth form in the root crown or the decaying parts of the rhizome. In the lab thin sections were made, they were used to count the growth rings and so determined the age.",

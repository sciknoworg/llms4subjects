            "abstract": "The acute phase response is the systemic reaction of an organism to insults like infection, trauma, or burning and it represents the first line\u02ba of defense of the body to tissue-damaging attacks.The source of circulating erythropoietin (EPO), the mediators and the mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of EPO-gene-expression during acute-phase reaction are still poorly understood. Acute phase reaction was induced either by intramuscular turpentine oil (TO) or intraperitoneal LPS injection into wild type and IL-6 knockout (KO) mice. Animals were sacrificed at different time points and blood, liver and muscle tissue were collected. Serum levels of erythropoietin were measured by ELISA; liver and injured muscle samples were processed for RNA isolation and for protein analysis. EPO, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha-mRNA was analysed by RT-PCR and the protein levels by western blot and EMSA. HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha localization was performed through immunofluorecence staining. EPO, HIF-1 and HIF-2 gene and protein expression were also analyzed in isolated mouse hepatocytes following stimulation with IL-6. ...",

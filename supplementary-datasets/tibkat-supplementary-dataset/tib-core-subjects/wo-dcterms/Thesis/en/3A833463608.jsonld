            "abstract": "Smallholder market participation has been discussed as a catalyst against poverty. This dissertation addresses policy tools to enable market linkage of small farmers in rural areas. It looks at road infrastructure improvement and NGO-based market linkage assistance. The research shows that a reduction of time traveled to commercial markets by 25% would increase household income from bean sales by between 3 and 12% of the current income. Regarding the effect of different NGO activities, we find that entrepreneurial practices-related activities show positive correlation with sales volume directed to non-local markets, confirming the effectiveness of the intervention. We also show that different groups of farmers benefit from interventions differently. Those who did not participate in commercial marketing previously benefited more than those who were already part of the supply chain before the project intervention.",

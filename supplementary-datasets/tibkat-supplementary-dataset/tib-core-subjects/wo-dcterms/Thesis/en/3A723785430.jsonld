                "Dilated Cardiomyopathy is a chronic myocardial disease characterized by progressive depression of contractile function and ventricular dilatation. It is the leading cause of heart failure and the most common reason for heart transplantation. Besides genetic causes, viral infection and autoimmune response are considered to play a major role in the etiology of the disease. Among different viruses that cause the disease, Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is predominantly associated with the development and progression of the disease. Moreover, Coxsackievirus induced myocarditis in the mouse mimics human myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. In the murine model, the disease progresses over a period of 90 days from acute myocarditis to chronic myocarditis and further develops into dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Though much is known about the progression of the disease, the molecular events occurring after infection with CVB3 are not completely understood. In the current study, comparative proteomic analysis of A.BY/SnJ mouse hearts 84 days post infection (84 d p.i.) with CVB3 and age-matched non-infected mouse hearts was performed. 2D-DIGE and gel-free LC-MS/MS were used to characterize the changes occurring at the molecular level and Western Blot analysis as well as immunohistochemical staining was carried out for validation of results. A total of 101 distinct proteins were identified as displaying dilated cardiomyopathy-associated changes in A.BY/SnJ mouse hearts 84 ...",

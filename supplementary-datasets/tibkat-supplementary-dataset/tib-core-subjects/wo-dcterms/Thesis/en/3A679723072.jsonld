            "abstract": "Research interest in the mechanical properties of membranes arises from the multitude of morphological and physiological functions they govern. However, the complexity of native membranes requires the use of model systems which mimic the behavior of biological membranes. Here, pore-spanning membranes, which combine the free-standing character of a black lipid membrane together with the stability of a solid-supported membrane, have been prepared on porous substrates. Fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and force indentation experiments performed on these pore-spanning membranes provided information about their mechanical properties. Pore-spanning polymer membranes were prepared from poly(butadiene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) polymersome rupture induced by osmotic stress. The pore-spanning polymer membranes were studied by force indentation experiments and were found to exhibit viscoelastic behavior. The energy dissipation was quantified through calculat! ion of the extent of hysteresis observed between indentation and retraction force curves. UV light cross-linking of the hydrophobic poly(butadiene) core of the polymer membranes was performed to study the effect of chain entanglement on their viscoelastic properties. Furthermore, two-step functionalization procedure was developed to prepare solvent-free, laterally mobile, robust pore-spanning phospholipid membranes by giant phospholipid vesicle rupture. Force indentation experiments provided membrane tension values, while preliminary membrane bending rigidity values were calculated from force needed to pull tethers out of pore-spanning membranes upon AFM tip retraction. Force volume imaging of several pores in a single experiment ...",

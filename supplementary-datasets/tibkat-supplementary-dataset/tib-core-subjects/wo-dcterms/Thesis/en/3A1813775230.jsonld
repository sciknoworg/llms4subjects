            "abstract": "In recent times, the study of landscape heritage acquires value by virtue of becoming an alternative to rethink regional development, especially from the point of view of territorial planning. In this sense, the Central Argentine Dairy Basin (CADB) is presented as a space where the traces of different human projects have accumulated over centuries of occupation, which can be read as heritage. The impact of dairy farming and other productive activities has shaped the configuration of its landscape. The main hypothesis assumed that a cultural landscape would have been formed in the CADB, whose configuration would have depended to a great extent on the history of productive activities and their deployment over the territory, and this same history would hide the keys to its alternative.  The thesis approached the object of study from descriptive and cartographic methods that placed the narration of the history of territory and the resources of the landscape as a discursive axis. A series of intentional readings of the territory and its constituent parts pondered the layers of data that have accumulated on it in the form of landscape traces, with the help of an approach from complementary dimensions (natural, sociocultural, productive, planning). Furthermore, the intersection of historical sources was used in order to allow the construction of the territorial story and the detection of the origin of the landscape components. A meticulous cartographic work also helped to spatialise the set of phenomena and elements studied, and was reflected in a multiscalar scanning.",

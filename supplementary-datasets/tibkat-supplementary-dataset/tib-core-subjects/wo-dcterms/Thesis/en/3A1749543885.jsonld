                "The present thesis examines an individualized and student-centered learning environment based on competency matrices and contrasts it with a conventional teacher-directed learning environment. The first part of this dissertation outlines the development of the student-centered learning environment and the theoretical background of motivational development. Subsequently, three studies contrast both types of learning environments with regards to motivational variables and their interplay in order to evaluate both learning environments and to examine predictors of motivation and learning behavior. The three studies are based on a dataset of 1,153 adolescent students aged 12\u201318 (M = 13.97, SD = 1.37, 49% girls). Study 1: investigates whether perceived autonomy mediates the association between self-efficacy and approaches to learning across both learning environments differently. Latent mean comparisons and multigroup multilevel structural equation modeling were conducted to examine the hypotheses. The results revealed that autonomy functions as a mediator in the association between self-efficacy and approaches to learning only for students from schools with a student-centered learning environment based on competency matrices. Study 2: investigates whether competence support mediates the association between academic self-concept and achievement motivation differently for students from both learning environments. Latent mean comparisons and multigroup structural equation modeling ...",

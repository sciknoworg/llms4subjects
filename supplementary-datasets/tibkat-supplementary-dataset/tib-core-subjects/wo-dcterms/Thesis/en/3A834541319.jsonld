            "abstract": "The phytopathogenic bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm), causing bacterial canker of tomato, is the most serious bacterial pathogen of tomato worldwide. The bacterium is considered as A2 quarantine organism by the European Plant Protection Organization (EPPO). Infected or contaminated tomato seed and transplants are obviously responsible for disease transmission from year to year and into new areas. The increasing outbreaks of canker disease during recent years indicate that the current diagnostic methods of Cmm used by the seed industry for seed health certifications are not reliable or sensitive enough for detecting Cmm in infested tomato seed and latently infected asymptomatic plants. The objective of this study was to improve the diagnostic methods of Cmm, since the previous methods often failed to detect low infections by Cmm in seeds and asymptomatic plant samples. Another objective was to investigate different seed treatment methods for eradicating Cmm from infected tomato seed.",

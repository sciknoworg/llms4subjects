            "title": "Measuring dynamic efficiency under uncertainty : a simulation study",
            "abstract": "Since 2003, measuring efficiency in dynamic contexts has received considerable attention. Dynamic efficiency analysis accounts for both the interdependency of production decisions over time, as well as adjustment costs, and also distinguishes between variable and quasi-fixed inputs in the production process. However, structural models of dynamic efficiency have thus far ignored uncertainty; this may lead to misleading measures of efficiency. Uncertainty affects the optimal allocation of input decisions and it is particularly true for the optimal adjustment of quasi-fixed factors over time. Hence, to fill this gap, this thesis aims to develop a theoretical model of dynamic efficiency under uncertainty based on the cost-minimization problem. To derive such a model, the author uses two components, namely the static shadow cost approach and a stochastic dual model of investments under uncertainty. The shadow cost approach allows one to disentangle economic inefficiency into technical and allocative inefficiency, while the stochastic intertemporal duality model enables one to consider uncertainty and adjustment costs. Formulating an empirical model requires one to specify the functional form of the respective value function. Here, the specified value function properties facilitate output and price uncertainty to influence optimal factor demand equations. The resulting empirical stochastic factor demand equations then serve as a starting point for the econometric estimation of technical and allocative inefficiency measures. Theoretical findings from the derived model were subsequently tested using a simulation, to determine how large the omitted variable bias is on the estimates of the coefficients if uncertainty is ignored in optimal factor allocations, and to analyze the influence of uncertainty on factor demand equations. The simulation results reveal that disregarding uncertainty in optimal factor allocations leads to biased estimates of model parameters.",

            "title": "Impacts of school costs, school infrastructure and household wealth on girls\u2019 schooling under the Free Primary Education policy: the case of Benin, West Africa : Heineck Guido",
            "abstract": "To reach the Millennium Development Goal of Universal Primary Education (UPE), developing countries have implemented numerous educational policies (United Nations, 2014). Despite the remarkable upsurge in schooling in these countries, gender-related inequalities are persistent, particularly in levels of attainment. A recent report of United Nations specified that only 23% of girls in poor rural households do complete the primary level of education in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 (UNESCO, 2014). This dissertation provides three potential explanations for these issues: the schooling costs; the school infrastructure; and the household wealth. The first explanation relates to the remaining schooling costs. Indeed, policies of removal of school fees often neglect that parents also support other kinds of schooling costs. These residual costs are the indirect costs and the opportunity costs, which are reasonably high in some developing countries. In the case of Benin, a West African country, despite the removal of school fees, the residual schooling costs remain high. Thus, the dilemma of which child to send to school is still relevant for poor households. The evaluation of the elimination of school fees in Benin provides evidence for this argument. The poor quality of schools' infrastructure in developing countries could be a second explanation for the gender gap in schooling. The long distances to the closest primary school, the large numbers of pupils in the classrooms, the lack of teachers and pedagogical materials are all factors that could discourage children\u2015especially girls\u2015in their school attendance. The evaluation of a demand-and-supply policy indicates the importance of a removal of school costs and the upgrading of the schools\u2019 infrastructure to reduce the gender gap in schooling. The third explanation relates to the importance of the household wealth on schooling decisions. A policy that eliminates school fees could maintain the dependence of schooling decisions on household wealth by neglecting the remaining schooling costs. In such a case, a wealth shock could be detrimental to the gender gap in schooling and on the efforts already engaged in to reach the goal of UPE. The assessment of the impact of a negative wealth shock on children\u2019s schooling and labor in Benin provides empirical evidence for this argument. The contributions of this dissertation are both theoretical and empirical. On one hand, this research meaningfully extends the literature on impact evaluation in Benin. Crucially, the country lacks research studies that evaluate economic policies. On the other hand, the relevance of the dissertation also lies in the analysis of the relationship between price and wealth effects. These effects are observed through the reactions of households to wealth or price changes. They indicate which policy\u2015based on the schooling price or the household wealth\u2015should be prioritized to enhance education in Benin. On the other hand again, the theory of the determinants of gender-related differences in schooling is also tested in the articles. Finally, this research uses novel methods in the field of impact evaluation with three natural experiments in the case of Benin to support the arguments.",

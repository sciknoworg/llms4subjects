            "abstract": "Oscillations are a hallmark of brain activity and can be generated by local synchronisation mechanisms. They have been implicated in the communication between brain areas. An important type of oscillations are \u03b8 oscillations (4-12 Hz), which are associated with different behaviours, such as movements and navigation, but they also play a crucial role in memory formation and retrieval. One of the major \u03b8 rhythm generators in the brain is the medial septum (MS), which with its different types of projecting neurons, innervates many cortical areas and synchronises their activity. I investigated two major projection types of the MS: GABAergic (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid \u2013 GABA) and cholinergic (acetylcholine \u2013 ACh) projections. Both projections are known to target the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus. Parvalbumin positive (PV+) projections of the MS, which are GABAergic, are known to synchronise cortical networks via disinhibition often by inhibiting interneurons. In contrast, cholinergic projections of the MS project to a wide range of cell types in the MEC and hippocampus and can have substantially different effects on the target cell (e.g. activation or inhibition). Thus, their function on a network can range from increasing activity through depolarising excitatory cells, to more inhibition of the network by activating interneurons, or even modulating synaptic integration. Previous studies have focussed on identifying projections to the hippocampus and the MEC but did not consider the parasubiculum (PaS), a major input of the MEC. In this study, we electrophysiologically characterised cells in the PaS and demonstrated layer I interneurons to be distinctly different from putative layer II interneurons. The PaS, with its strong \u03b8 rhythmic firing cells, was shown to have the highest density of MS PV+ fibres in the parahippocampal formation, suggesting that it is an important target of MS projections and yet MS inputs to the PaS are unknown. Using channelrhodopsin (ChR2), a light sensitive ion channel, expressed ...",

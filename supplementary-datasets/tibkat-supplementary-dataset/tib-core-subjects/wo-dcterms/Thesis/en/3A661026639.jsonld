            "abstract": "Due to the increasing demand for wood and renewable energy sources, short-rotation forestry with its reliance on highly productive Populus species is in the focus of current ecological research. In order to optimize biomass gain, Populus research has in recent decades mainly centred on productivity and related traits for poplar species which could be proven to be highyielding. Aspen (Populus tremula and Populus tremuloides), however, have for a long time been neglected, because their highest annual increment occurs later than for e.g. black poplar and balsam poplar and they therefore need longer rotation times. However, in this thesis we concentrated on aspen (P. tremula and P. tremuloides) as study objects because they cope better with drought on poor soils and have the lowest demand regarding habitat conditions when compared to other poplar species. These features make aspen a promising alternative for short-rotation forestry in the face of the future climate scenarios, which include increasing temperatures and decreasing summer precipitation. Therefore, we established a common-garden experiment in 2008 with closely related aspen full-sib families (P. tremula: 2-30% genetic distance) as study objects. In the subsequent year, we established a field experiment with more distantly related aspen collectives (P. tremula: 20-40% genetic distance) originating from Central Europe as well as two different aspen species (P. tremula with German origin and P. tremuloides with American background differing 77% in their genetic distance) as study objects ...",

            "abstract": "The aim of the first investigation was to devise an efficient protocol for getting a satisfactory embryo yield accomplished by combining the recently established ovsynch protocol with pFSH superovulatory treatment. Furthermore, the intention was to minimize the incidence of premature luteal regression frequently encountered in superovulated goats by substituting hCG for GnRH. A total of 51 pluriparous Boer goat does, 2-6 years of age, was subjected to superovulatory treatment and, thereafter, randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups. The does of Group 1 were subjected to an im injection of 0.004 mg of the GnRH analog Buserelin (Receptal\u00ae) 18 hours after the superovulatory treatment; does of Group 2 received 500 IU hCG (Chorulon\u00ae) and does of Group 3, 1 mL sterile physiological saline solution. Blood samples, collected every 2 h from 1 h before until 42 h after treatment, were analyzed for plasma LH concentration. With the intention to exactly determine ovulationtime, in a subsample of each group ovaries were scanned ultrasonically at 2 hour intervals from 18 hours after the ovulation inducting treatment until after ovulation had taken place ...",

            "abstract": "Cancer is one of the major causes of mortality in developed countries. In 2020, there were more than 19.3 million new cases of tumor malignancies worldwide, with more than 10 million deaths. The high rates of cancer cases and mortality necessitate extensive research and the development of novel cancer treatments and antitumor agents. In most cases, conventional treatment strategies for tumor therapy are based on chemotherapeutic treatment, which is supplemented with radiotherapy and/or surgical resection of solid tumors [1]. The use of chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer has significant side effects, the most dangerous of which is toxicity [2] [3]. Modern methods of treating tumors focus on specific drug delivery to the tumor site, actively targeting the tumor cells, as well as the reduction of side effects. One of the most promising current approaches is based on oncolytic viruses. Antitumor properties of viruses were documented at the beginning of the 20th century when some cancer patients recovered after acute viral infections, particularly influenza [4]. Vaccinia virus (VACV) is a member of the Poxviridae family, has natural antitumor properties, and provides a good basis for generating efficient recombinant oncolytic strains. Furthermore, VACV has never been shown to integrate into the host genome [5]. VACV is likely one of the safest and well-studied viruses due to extensive research being done in molecular biology and pathophysiology to investigate its potential as a vaccine for smallpox eradication programs. It has been administered to over 200 million people worldwide. VACV antitumor therapeutic effectiveness has been established in xenograft models with a variety of tumor types for human and canine cancers. Furthermore, recombinant oncolytic VACVs expressing genes encoding light-emitting proteins are a big improvement in a treatment strategy that combines tumor-specific therapies and diagnostics. Oncolytic virus treatments are effective in xenograft cancer models in mice, however, the significant ...",

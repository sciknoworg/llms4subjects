            "abstract": "In this work, two areas of ants` functioning in ecosystem were studied. On the one hand, I investigated how ants affect the aboveground system by acting as mutualistic partners and predators of honeydew producers and on the other hand how ants affect the belowground system by nest building activity and by modulating resource availability for microorganisms. The aim of this study was to get insights into the complexity of the system involving ants with their direct and indirect effects on their mutualistic partners, the host plant of these partners and the soil microbial community Ant aboveground effects were tested in two artificial systems and resulted in marginal significant changes of aphid and plant conditions, but the ant effect depended on the availability of alternative food, what can lead to changes in ant tending activity and consequently exert effects on aphids and their host plants. Ant belowground effects were addressed in all five experiments. Out of these experiments, three studies were carried out in natural systems. Here, ants increased soil nutrients and fungal diversity and caused changes in functional diversity of soil microbial communities, but soil nutrients and fungal diversity were strongly influenced by season and soil moisture changes. In artificial systems ant induced an increased 15N flow to soil and changed microbial parameter (basal respiration, microbial biomass, bacterial DGGE profile).",

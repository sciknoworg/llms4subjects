            "abstract": "Transport of trace gases within the atmospheric boundary layer plays a key role in feedback processes between the earth's surface and the atmosphere and consequently in ecosystem budgets of carbon and nitrogen (among many more). For a correct quantification of the exchange between surface and atmosphere, it is crucial to understand the transport processes involved and to determine limitations of the presently available measurement techniques in order to apply the right technique with respect to the currently active transport processes. This dissertation focuses on three topics: (a) The analysis of effects of vertical transport mechanisms on surface measurements of trace gases, (b) the appropriate choice of an experimental setup to assess specific measurement errors of moving measurement systems and (c) the application of a series of measurement techniques for surface fluxes of reactive trace gases to determine their degree of agreement and to assess potential source of deviations. To study the impact of vertical transport mechanisms on surface trace gas measurements, this thesis presents a comprehensive set of measurements at the surface and within the atmospheric boundary layer (by tethered balloon). It enables the attribution of a recurrent negative excursion of ozone mixing ratios in the morning hours at a mountain summit to a very efficient vertical transport by free convection ...",

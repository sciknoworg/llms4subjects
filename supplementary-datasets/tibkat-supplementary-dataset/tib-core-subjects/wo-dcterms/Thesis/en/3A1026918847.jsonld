            "abstract": "Abstract: This empirical study follows an applied research question. It sets out to illuminate political, economic and ideational influences on the agricultural sector of Ghana as well as the role of aid within it. The inter-disciplinary approach combines theories of development studies, political science, (economic) history and anthropology, presenting a descriptive analysis that was informed by primary data collected during 16-months of field research. Qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews (260), focus group discussions (4), and participatory observations in pertinent meetings in the capital (14) as well as three months on the fields in Northern Ghana informed the findings.<br><br>Ghana\u2019s agricultural data systems are of highly questionable quality, as (quantitative and qualitative) research has been neglected, leading to conceptualizing and implementing of imprudent agricultural initiatives. Instead the focus on mechanization and modernization since independence, by national governments and aid agencies alike, have steadily snubbed smallholder-famers knowledge and accelerated the degradation of soils. The relationship between the governments and development partners is defined by inequalities, lack of transparencies, as well as financial and ideational dependencies. Fifteen active donors were running close to 100 agricultural projects and programs in 2016, invariably copying the high-external-input, private sector focused, agricultural approach chosen in the West, with most Ghanaians summarizing the situation of aid and agricultural in Ghana with: \u201cHe who pays the piper calls the tune\u201d",

            "abstract": "Tropical plants are colonized by a highly diverse community of fungal endophytes. Factors contributing to fungal endophyte diversity pattern and underlying mechanisms are, however, largely unknown. Interactions between host plants and their endophytes are regarded to be highly complex and dynamic. The life cycles of endophytic fungi, their distribution, and diversity are driven by host plant conditions and environmental factors. Some fungal endophytes may be latent pathogens, mutualists or anti-pathogens, depending on their host plants or not yet identified signals inducing switches in their life cycles. The introduction of cultivated plants to new geographic regions provides an opportunity to compare the fungal endophyte diversity between continents. Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) has been introduced to Sulawesi less than 25 years ago and is therefore reflecting local endophyte communities on a quite recently co-adapted level. This study aimed at evaluating the changes in fungal endophyte communities in cacao leaves, based on interactions with the host plant and environmental parameters. It provides information about endophyte diversity of the area and therefore about potential outbreaks of latent pathogens in cacao or intercrops, due to environmental conditions.",

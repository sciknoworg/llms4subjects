In addition, the limits of typical high voltage devices of a BCDMOS technology are shown. New options to increase the robustness within device development are explained using examples and afterwards generalized. Specific protection structures need to be used additionally if these options are not sufficient to achieve the required robustness. The related problems and limits are demonstrated using examples. First, an introduction to Smart Power and its process details, an overview about field effect transistors, bipolar structures in general and especially thyristors are given. Following ESD and ISO events, dualization and characteristics of H-bridges are analysed. The basic behaviour of power transistors is discussed. The so called Dual Thyristor is developed based on the theoretical background and its applications are shown. The Dual Thyristor combines significantly increased self protective characteristics with an excellent performance as a power switch. In this work an integrated version for a BCDMOS technology for Infineon Technologies AG is introduced. The Dual Thyristor as High-Side-Switch for an Half Bridge or H-Bridge has better cost/performance-indicators compared to p-channel and n-channel switches including driver stages. Lateral High-Voltage-Devices are discussed. Complex simulations are necessary to demonstrate the destruction processes. 2D simulation gives a first insight to internal processes. Parallelization of 2D-structures at the same or different sizes allows further qualitative improved statements about trigger behaviour of the parasitic bipolar transistor. However, the 3D thermodynamic simulation with extended simulation time of several weeks is needed to get quantitative valid statements regarding the device behaviour. Construction rules for a robust design are derived. For example, smooth doping profile from drift region to drain contact. Appropriate doping profile of the body towards the drift region enables dynamic base push out. A new construction of the drift region allows accumulation of carriers for the on state and further improved extraction of carriers in the off state combined with reduced length of drift region. All this measures can be realized at the same cost or with improved cost/performance ratio. Protection structures are used if a device is not able to fulfil the strong robustness requirements especially in the field of automotive applications. The internal workflows under extreme overload conditions, as trigger behaviour of bipolar and thyristor structures and the hence resulting problems are demonstrated using examples.

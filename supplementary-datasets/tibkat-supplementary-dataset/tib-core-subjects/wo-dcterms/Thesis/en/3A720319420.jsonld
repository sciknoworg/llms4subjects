            "abstract": "This thesis comprises studies on the two major domains of motor control  posture and movement  with special focus on human upper limbs. Endeffector stiffness characterises the resistance of the arm against external disturbances in the hand coordinate frame, and is the key quantity to study arm posture. This thesis presents a method for stiffness estimation in three-dimensional endeffector space. The approach enables us to study stiffness in natural postures throughout the daily used workspace. Derived stiffness is tested in the light of results known from classical studies on human upper limbs restricted to a horizontal plane. A variation of stiffness direction and size with hand position as well as with arm posture is found. While the direction of highest stiffness is shown to be aligned with the hand-shoulder axis in planar studies, it turns out to be approximately in a line with the forearm axis in the unrestrained arm. This suggests that major compensations of external disturbances are accomplished at shoulder level. The second part of this thesis deals with human arm movements under time pressure in left- as well as right-handed participants using both preferred and non-preferred hand ...",

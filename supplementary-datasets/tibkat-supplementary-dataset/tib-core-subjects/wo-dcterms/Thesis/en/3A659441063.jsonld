It is composed of mineral platelets, which consist of aragonite, a CaCO3-polymorph, and of a small amount of organic matter, the so called organic matrix. The organic matrix can be subdivided into the soluble and the insoluble matrix, whereby this definition is preparation dependent. The nacre and the organic components used in this thesis originated from the marine gastropods Haliotis laevigata and Haliotis tuberculata. This thesis contains mainly three parts presenting results. The first part concentrates on the investigation of the growth of calciumcarbonate crystals on the insoluble matrix and the influence of the soluble matrix on this growth process. In the experiment a crystallization device was used, which contained the insoluble matrix and was flowed through by NaHCO3- and CaCl2-solutions and by different concentrations of the soluble matrix as an additive. Investigations via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that besides vaterite and calcite crystals, also flat crystals develop on the insoluble matrix. With the addition of a relatively high concentration of 1ug/ml soluble matrix CaCO3-crystal growth was totally inhibited, whereas the addition of 0.02ug/ml soluble matrix slightly increases growth of flat crystals compared to experiments without any additive. By analyzing diffraction pattern recorded in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) the flat crystals could be identified as aragonite. Furthermore some of the flat crystals formed a layered structure induced by growth between the horizontal layers of the insoluble matrix. Thus, the morphology as well as the crystal polymorph remind on natural grown nacre. In the second part of the thesis a central feature in the aragonite platelets was investigated by TEM to obtain information on the growth processes in ...",

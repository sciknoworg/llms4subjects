            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: In the present thesis the epitaxial growth, crystal structure, stoichiometry, thermal stability and lattice dynamics of self-organized EuSi2 and DySi2 films, nanoislands and nanowires are investigated. The rare earth silicide (RESi) nanostructures have attracted considerable interest due to their high conductivity, very low Schottky barrier heights, remarkable chemical stability, self-organization in high area density and defects-free nano-objects with tunable size and shape, and the direct integration into the Si technology. The extensive research is driven by the continuous downscaling of the CMOS electronics that require new approaches in the devices architecture and circuits interconnects. Although RESi nanostructures attracted a lot of interest already several years ago and a lot of research has been done in this field, the lattice dynamics of these materials are still unknown. Recent developments at third generation synchrotron radiation sources have brought their performance to a stage where phonon spectroscopy of nanostructures and thin layers became feasible using nuclear inelastic X-ray scattering. This novel experimental technique is based on the process of phonon-assisted nuclear resonant absorption/emission of X-rays from the nuclei of M\u00f6ssbauer-active isotopes. The method provides direct access to the phonon density of states (DOS) of the investigated element. Together with the ab inito calculations it was possible to get a comprehensive understanding of the lattice dynamics.EuSi2 films and nanoislands and DySi2 films, nanoislands and nanowires have been grown on the vicinal Si(001) surface by molecular beam epitaxy. While DySi2 was grown following known growth procedures, the growth conditions for EuSi2 had to be established first. EuSi2 was grown at two different growth conditions to study the influence of crystal structure and morphology upon different growth temperatures. The structure has been characterized by in situ and ex situ diffraction techniques revealing the tetragonal I41/amd crystal structure for both films and nanoislands at both growth temperatures, while the surface morphology changes significantly depending on the growth temperature. The thermal stability study performed by in situ high temperature GISAXS experiments demonstrated that EuSi2 nanoislands break down upon annealing at 1050 \u00b0C due to silicide decomposition followed by desorption of Eu atoms from the Si(001) surface. In contrast, DySi2 nanoisl ...",

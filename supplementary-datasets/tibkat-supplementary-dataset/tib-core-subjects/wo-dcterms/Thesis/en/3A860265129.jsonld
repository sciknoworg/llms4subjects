            "abstract": "This thesis develops a conceptual framework for a better understanding of the impact of slow-onset climate and environmental changes on human migration in developing countries. Its regional focus is on the West African Sahel, where the majority of the population depends on agriculture and thus is highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Migration from fragile environments is predominantly considered one of several household strategies to adapt to and minimise the risk of environmental stress. Based on qualitative and quantitative data from two selected rural study areas, Bandiagara in Mali and Lingu\u00e8re in Senegal, this thesis analyses the drivers of migration from the two areas. The findings illustrate that, even though people highly depend on the natural environment, migration motives are manifold and that migration often is not a household strategy to cope with environmental changes. Although environmental conditions shape migration in the region and the migrants\u2019 support is crucial for most households, environmental stress plays a relatively small role as a driver of migration - at least in Mali, where it is considerably less important than in Senegal. On the contrary, migration is often driven by better opportunities elsewhere rather than by livelihood stressors in the home area. Particularly the migration of young people is often an individual rather than a household decision and influenced by individual aspirations, such as aspirations for consumer goods or a better future, rather than by environmental stress. This thesis claims that research should consider people\u2019s capabilities to migrate or to stay as well as their individual aspirations and preferences - in addition to the household\u2019s needs and the opportunities elsewhere. This is important in order to explain why some people stay in and others migrate from an area affected by environmental stress, though living under similar conditions. Depending on people\u2019s capabilities to choose freely between staying and migrating and their preferences and aspirations for one or the other activity, people can either be \u201cvoluntary migrants\u201d, \u201cvoluntary non-migrants\u201d, \u201cforced migrants\u201d or \u201ctrapped people\u201d. Moreover, it is important to consider social trends and transformation processes in the analysis of the linkages between environment change and migration. Higher education levels and aspirations to a \u201cmodern\u201d lifestyle among young people, for instance, might decrease the impact of environmental factors on migration, despite worsening environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "X-ray grating spectra provide much spectral detail from classical nova outbursts. They supplied the confirmation of continued mass loss from the nova in the late super-soft source (SSS) stage of the outburst. It is not clear a priori, what the influence of the mass loss on the spectrum is, apart from causing systematic blue shifts in the absorption lines. In order to answer this question, and to test whether it is safe to neglect this aspect of expansion in model atmospheres for novae in the SSS stage, physically consistent models for expanding nova atmospheres have been developed in this work. The very high temperatures of these models combinded with high expansion velocities and the accompanying large radial extension make nova in the SSS phase very interesting objects but also physically complicated objects to model. In this work the general purpose radiative transport code PHOENIX, designed to deal with expanding atmospheres, has been chosen for modeling X-ray novae. PHOENIX has been used for this type of objects before, but careful analysis of the old results lead to a number of new methods and improvements to the code, being the main achievement of this work. Firstly, essential improvements to the physical treatment of NLTE have been made, including: new opacity expressions, a new rate matrix solver, a new global iteration scheme, and a new temperature correction method. Secondly, a new hybrid hydrostatic-dynamic nova atmosphere setup has been implemented ...",

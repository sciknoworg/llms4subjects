            "abstract": "Methods of controlling and subjecting actually and potentially dormant bodies can be analysed as sleep disciplines. This study is concerned with the ways in which this type of discipline has worked as ideology by subjecting its addressees, with God, the ever wakeful, as ultimate Subject. Aspects of sleep discipline as ideology are traced in religious discourses, which are reconstructed as a series of wake-up calls. These are systematised here as biblical, anthropological and ascetic calls. They are not mutually exclusive but highlight different facets of Christian sleep discipline. Contemporary discourses on sleep, whether religious or not, still interpellate their sleeping and waking addressees as subjects. This has also been done by material culture. Contemporary fiction has much more to say about dystopian sleep than about alternative hopes for a sleep utopia. Yet, it may be precisely in the sense of negatively preserving the utopian imagination that we can momentarily imagine ourselves beyond what ideological sleep disciplines have done to our and our forebears\u2019 bodies.",

            "abstract": "Soil nutrient pools, concentrations and turnover as well as soil nutrient inputs due to deposition and canopy exchange have been studied intensively in all kinds of forest ecosystems worldwide. In studies about temperate forests, the main focus concerning the macronutrients was on carbon and nitrogen, whereas phosphorus was rather of interest in tropical forests. However, due to increasing nitrogen deposition, phosphorus became or will become a growth limiting factor of many temperate forests. In addition, the changing climate will affect these ecosystems and their nutrient cycling. To be prepared for these changes the establishment of mixed species forests is recommended since mixed forests are supposed to be more resistant and resilient against disturbances than monocultures. In large parts of Central Europe the potential natural forest vegetation is dominated by beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). Hence, mixed beech forests are assumed to have a high ecological and economic value in the face of climate change ...",

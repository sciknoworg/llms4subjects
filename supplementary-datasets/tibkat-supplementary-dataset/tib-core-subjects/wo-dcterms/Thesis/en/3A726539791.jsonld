            "title": "Biogenesis of respiratory chain: Rcf1 and Rcf2 as a novel assembly factors",
            "abstract": "The mitochondrial respiratory chain consists of four membrane-embedded electron transport complexes (complexes I  IV) and the ATP synthesizing F1F0ATPase. Within the inner mitochondrial membrane these complexes assemble into supercomplexes, forming so-called respirasomes. Although understanding the biogenesis and function of these higher oligomeric structures has been the subject of intense research for many years it still remains largely enigmatic. The aim of this work was to obtain novel insights into respirasome formation and their cellular relevance. Using an affinity chromatography based strategy respiratory supercomplexes from yeast, S. cerevisiae mitochondria were purified and novel factors identified and characterized. Rcf1 and Rcf2 are reported to be complex IV components. While Rcf2 is present only among the yeast species, Rcf1 is a conserved subunit and has two human homologs, RCF1a and RCF1b. Yeast cells lacking Rcf1 are affected in cytochrome oxidase activity and display reduced growth efficiency, especially pronounced during hypoxia. Both mutants, rcf1? and rcf2?, show increased ROS production. Rcf1 mediates oligomerization of respiratory complexes, specifically for the formation of oligomers consisting of complex III dimer and two complex IV monomers. Additionally, Rcf1 is necessary for efficient assembly of subunits Cox13 and Rcf2 into the cytochrome oxidase complex ...",

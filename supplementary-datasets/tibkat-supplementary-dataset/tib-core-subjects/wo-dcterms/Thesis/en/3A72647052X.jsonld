            "abstract": "alpah-synuclein is a neuronal protein involved in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD). Misfolding and accumulation of a-synuclein into cytoplasmic inclusions correlate with the pathogenesis of PD and are reproducible upon overexpression in yeast. GAL1 promoter-driven wild type (WT) and mutant a-synucleins were studied in parallel with their fluorescently tagged counterparts. Overexpression of WT and of A53T mutant a-synuclein impaired yeast growth and resulted in cytoplasmic accumulations. Fluorescently-tagged versions preserved these effects when the tag was fused C-terminally via a linker. Three WT copies or two A53T copies integrated into one genomic locus resulted in significant growth impairment and accumulation in yeast and represent thresholds for toxicity. A30P mutant a-synuclein had only a mild inhibitory effect to yeast growth and formed aggregates transiently when overexpressed. The triple proline designer mutant A30P/A56P/A76P did not affect growth or formed inclusions. Promoter shut-off experiments revealed that yeast cells can recover from transient a-synuclein expression by clearing aggregates. Proteasomal inhibition by the drug MG132 or by a cim3-1 genetic mutation did not significantly impair aggregate clearance. This suggests only a minor contribution of the 26S proteasome to alpha-synuclein degradation. In contrast, a major impairment in clearance in yeast cells treated with vacuolar protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride suggested a prominent function of vacuolar proteases. Consistently, a delta pep4 yeast mutant characterized by vacuolar defects presented impaired clearance ability",

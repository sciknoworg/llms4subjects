            "abstract": "The most fundamental decision problem in computer science is the halting problem, i.e., given a description of a program and an input, decide whether the program terminates after finitely many steps or runs forever on that input. While Turing showed this problem to be undecidable in general, developing static analysis techniques that can automatically prove termination for many pairs of programs and inputs is of great practical interest. This is true in particular for logic programming, as the inherent lack of direction in the computation virtually guarantees that any non-trivial program terminates only for certain classes of inputs.  Thus, termination of logic programs is widely studied and significant advances have been made during the last decades. Nowadays, there are fully-automated tools that try to prove termination of a given logic program w.r.t. a given class of inputs.  Nevertheless, there still remain many logic programs that cannot be handled by any current termination technique for logic programs that is amenable to automation. Another area where termination has been studied even more intensively is term rewriting. This basic computation principle underlies the evaluation mechanism of many programming languages. Significant advances towards powerful automatable termination techniques during the last decade have yielded a plethora of powerful tools for proving termination automatically ...",

                "Traffic accidents are the main cause of death beneath young adults. Young road users are represented above average in accident statistics. The reduction of these deadly injured road users is the main purpose of road safety measures. The gain and the impact of these measures highly depend on the acceptance of the measures among road users. Especially vehicle based safety measures have to be financed and used by the driver himself. The transfer of evident effective safety measures \"in the heads\" of human beings is the key to a higher effectiveness of these measures. In this survey students of the advanced technical college in Stralsund and the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University in Greifswald at the age of 18-30 years were questioned. Beside demographic data and the traffic attendance, the potential of different road safety measures to reduce traffic accidents was asked. Furthermore, the preference of vehicle based safety measures was examined. It could be proved that the perceived efficiency was judged independently to a very large degree of the objective efficiency. Road safety measures which do not affect the road user's personal driving stile were judged significantly better than measures that affect his style. The high-risk group of male and motorized drivers rated road safety measures constantly more ineffective than the comparison group. A clear age relation could not be proved. To reduce the high number of deaths by accident, road users have to be convinced of the ...",

            "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells genetic information in the form of long linear DNA fibers is stored in the cell nucleus. Time and tissue specific gene expression patterns are manifested by the combination of DNA with proteins resulting in a structure called chromatin. The basic repeating element of chromatin is the nucleosome, where DNA is wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins, interconnected by sections of linker DNA. Both DNA and histones are subject to chemical modifications, which are associated with certain chromatin states. Several factors that set or recognize such modifications have been described in the recent years. Heterochromatin is a chromatin form that is characterized by compaction, transcriptional inactivity and late replication in S-phase. It is associated with methylation of DNA and histones. Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is one hallmark of heterochromatin, and is mediated by the methyltransferase Suv39 and recognized by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which has three isoforms in mammalian cells. How these and other enzymes and factors establish and maintain distinct chromatin states is not yet completely understood ...",

            "abstract": "Liver damage is a serious clinical complication of gamma-irradiation. CXC- and CC-chemokines, known to attract inflammatory cells, play a role in transmigration process during inflammation. Chemokines are generated locally at sites of inflammation and orchestrate the recruitment of specific subpopulations of leukocytes from blood into tissues. The aim of this work was to study the recruitment of inflammatory cells in different regions of rat liver tissue by means of immunohistology and to extend the analysis on chemokines known to be involved in recruitment of inflammatory cells. A mild hepatocellular damage was observed after gamma-irradiation by analyzing the liver enzymes in rat serum. Furthermore, CXCL2 serum concentration was also significantly increased up to 3 hours after irradiation as compared to sham-irradiated controls. Immunohistologically, 3-6 hours after irradiation an increased number of neutrophil granulocytes (but not of mononuclear phagocytes) was observed attached to portal vessels between and around the portal (myo)fibroblasts (SMA and Thy-1+ cells) in rat liver ...",

            "abstract": "Chiral compounds are widely used for several applications, and the demand of enantiomerically pure compounds significantly rose during last years. In particular, chirality has been dominating the scene in pharmaceutical chemistry during the past decades, due to a new awareness of the differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two enantiomers of the same API. Even though the market for achiral and racemic compounds has not expired yet, the percentage of drugs introduced to the market as single enantiomers increased dramatically. Several methods have been discovered and developed to obtain chiral compounds as single enantiomers. Asymmetric synthesis is object of extensive research in organic chemistry, though often does not provide products in high yields and stereoselectivity. Chiral resolution, that is the separation of single enantiomers from a racemic mixture to obtain each of them as homochiral, is nowadays largely used, especially for industrial applications. The exploited methods are usually easy, fast and cheap ways to obtain enantiopure compounds, and often are more convenient than asymmetric synthesis. Nevertheless, by definition, the highest affordable yield of a single enantiomer via chiral resolution is 50%. Applying racemization conditions to chiral resolution techniques the discarded enantiomer can be continuously interconverted and it is possible to achieve up to quantitative yield. Recently, a new approach called Viedma ripening emerged, allowing complete solid state deracemization of racemates. The application of this methodology to intrinsically chiral organic molecules is based on two fundamental prerequisites: the compound must crystallize as a conglomerate, i.e. a mechanical mixture of enantiomerically pure crystals; racemization conditions have to be applied in solution in order to continuously interconvert one enantiomer into the other. This PhD work has been focused on racemization methods, aiming at delving deeper into the involved mechanisms, in order to improve the ...",

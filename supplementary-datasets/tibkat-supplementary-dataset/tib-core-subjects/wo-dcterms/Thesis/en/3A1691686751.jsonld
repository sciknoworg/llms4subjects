            "abstract": "Abstract: Groundwater is the largest storage of freshwater worldwide and in Central Europe. It is the main source of public water supply and of crucial for agricultural irrigation, river discharge and surface water quality. As detailed observations of groundwater are scarce, analyses and predictions related to this topic are usually subject to large uncertainties. Particularly in the context of altered hydrological fluxes due to climate change it is important to broaden the scientific knowledge of the groundwater system and its sensitivity to climate. In consideration of numerous drought events in Central Europe during the last years, the groundwater\u2019s reaction to drought and its role for the propagation of drought is of particular interest. This thesis comprises five studies which extend the understanding of Central European groundwater systems under drought and assess potential future changes based on the groundwater\u2019s sensitivity to climate.<br>Droughts propagate through the hydrological cycle. Therefore, analyses on (groundwater) drought usually assess precipitation deficits as a first step to identify the relevant events. Due to the large number of available meteorological data sets, this step is not unambiguous. Study 1 of this thesis compares different data sets demonstrating the differences and commonalities resulting from different data set resolutions and interpolation algorithms. Altogether it can be concluded, that the absolute precipitation of low-resolution data sets is not an accurate measure for drought studies on a small scale whereas relative measures such as standardized indices are more reliable. These results serve as a basis for the methodology of the following studies.<br>The water quality of surface water depends on a variety of factors. Study 2 investigates the relationship between the deterioration of water quality during dry periods and catchment characteristics. It is shown that different properties are responsible for the responses of different water quality parameters. For example, there is a strong linkage between the geology in the catchment \u2013 which determines the chemical load of the groundwater \u2013 and the changes of sulfate concentration in the surface water during low flow. On the opposite, changes in the concentrations of chloride and nitrate during dry periods are mainly driven by the amount of sewage discharge within the catchment.<br>Every groundwater system reacts on different time scales to precipitation defi ...",

            "abstract": "The RanGAP1-RanBP2 complex represents a fascinating macromolecular assembly comprising at least two enzymatic activities. On one hand, it harbors the GTP hydrolysis activating function of RanGAP1 together with RanBP2, and on the other hand, RanBP2 in concert with Ubc9 contains Sumo conjugating activity. Together, these proteins are not only crucial regulators of nucleocytoplasmic transport in interphase cells but they also play an important yet ill-defined role in kinetochore function during mitosis. To gain insight into the RanGAP1-RanBP2 complex specifically in mitotic cells, I searched for mitosis-specific interaction partners. This led to the identification of the nuclear export receptor Crm1 and the GTPase Ran as stable components in complex with RanGAP1, RanBP2 and Ubc9 in mitotic cells. In addition, the complex seemed to contain many different proteins at substochiometric levels. These could, for example, be NES containing Crm1 interactors and/or targets for RanBP2 dependent sumoylation. As RanBP2 dependent Sumo targets are largely unknown, I devised a strategy to enrich sumoylated proteins from immunoprecipitated RanGAP1-RanBP2 complexes. This allowed mass-spectrometric identification of 90 putative Sumo substrates specifically enriched in mitotic RanGAP1 complexes; 6 of these were selected for further validation. All candidates associated with mitotic RanGAP1 complexes (Topo II alpha, TACC2, CKAP-5, Plk1, USP7, PIAS1), and most of these could be sumoylated in vitro with recombinant factors (TACC2, Plk1) or as proteins associated with mitotic RanGAP1-RanBP2 complexes as source of Sumo E3 ligase activity (TopoII alpha, Plk1, USP7). Strikingly, the Sumo E3 ligase PIAS1 also co-purified with RanGAP1 from mitotic cells and was efficiently sumoylated in these experiments. Further analysis suggested that mitotic RanGAP1 is present in a complex with PIAS1 distinct from the RanGAP1-RanBP2 complex ...",

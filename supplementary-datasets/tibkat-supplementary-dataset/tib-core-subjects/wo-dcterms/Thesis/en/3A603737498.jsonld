            "abstract": "This study is concerned with the reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental history of southeastern Australia for the last ~300 ka by establishing a luminescence chronology of dune sand deposition. For this purpose, a study area in the western Murray Basin in southeastern South Australia was chosen which today is characterised by semi-arid climate conditions. Vast fields of palaeodunes, stabilised by vegetation, provide evidence of past environmental change. By dating these dunes, past climatic changes can be deciphered, providing valuable information for predicting future climate change. In total, 97 samples were collected from dune sand layers and the time of their deposition was determined using multiple grain and single grain optically stimulated luminescence dating of the quartz fraction. A significant spread in equivalent doses (De) was noticed on a multiple grain scale. In order to analyse the De-distributions in more detail and to gain information on the sources of variations in equivalent doses, single grain measurements were carried out on all samples. Based on analysis of single grain De-distributions, field observations and laboratory bleaching tests, it was demonstrated that mainly microdosimetric effects and post-sedimentary mixing by bioturbation were responsible for the spread of the De-values. Although some of the dune sands exhibited intensive pre-depositional iron crusts, they were well bleached at the time of deposition. To account for the mixing of sediment layers of different age by bioturbation, De-values were calculated using the finite mixture model (Galbraith and Green 1990). The investigation of the De-distributions of samples not affected by bioturbation demonstrated that microdosimetric effects accounted for ~20% of the observed spread in De-values ...",

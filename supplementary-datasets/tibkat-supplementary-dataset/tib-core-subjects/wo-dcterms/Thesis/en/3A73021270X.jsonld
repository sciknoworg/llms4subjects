            "abstract": "Global warming is one of the most crucial and challenging problems in recent times. However, many aspects of this field are highly fraught with uncertainty, including the new particle formation in the atmosphere. Aside from aerosol formation through organic compounds, it is also possible to form particles through inorganic substances. One example in the atmosphere is the binary nucleation from sulphuric acid and water. Crossreactions between organic compounds and sulphuric acid are possible as well, but only under laboratory conditions due to higher concentrations of the reactants. In the present study, ozonolysis experiments with unsaturated alkenes were conducted. During the process, much higher concentrations than in the atmosphere were used to show distinct dependencies of the new particle formation from particular intermediates. The approach to the study was to vary certain parameters of the reaction with regard to the structure of the reactant (alkenes, unsaturated alcohols, carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids) and of the environment (total pressure, oxygen ratio, addition of additives as sulphuric acid, water or cyclohexane). The aerosols were characterized by a SMPS-Setup (Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer); gas phase products were identified and quantified by infrared spectroscopy.",

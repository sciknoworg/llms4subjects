            "title": "Stability and reactivity of organic molecules in geothermal reservoirs",
            "abstract": "The present work deals with laboratory studies of tracers for geothermal applications. Analytical methods for the detection of molecules being used as non-reactive tracers are presented and investigations of their thermal stability as well. Furthermore, the synthesis of substances is described which can undergo a reaction by hydrolysis. Additionally, these substances are explored for their application as thermosensitive tracers by lab experiments. For the characterization of several geothermal reservoir properties, tracer tests are the method of choice. Only by tracer tests it is possible to track flow paths, to estimate reservoir fluid volumes and fluid dwell times, and various other parameters that are essential for the operation of a geothermal reservoir. But the results gained from tracer tests are often distorted or misguided due to a lack of knowledge of the substance behavior in the reservoir. Also, the analytical methods may be incorrect or not sensitive to the substance. Naphthalene sulfonates are widely used as conservative tracers in geothermal applications. In this work, an analytical method was developed and validated that is able to detect different naphthalene sulfonate isomers from highly saline geothermal brines in the sub-\u00e6g/L range. The method bases on high-performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with fluorescence detection and solid phase extraction. Beside conservative tracers, thermally reacting substances are under investigation by several research groups ...",

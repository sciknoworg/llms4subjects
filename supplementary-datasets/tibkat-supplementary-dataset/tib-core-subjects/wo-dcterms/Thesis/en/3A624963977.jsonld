            "title": "Short-term variations in middle atmospheric ozone induced by solar forcing",
            "abstract": "Ozone, stratosphere, mesosphere, 27-day, diurnal, variation. - Ozone is one of the most publicly discussed atmospheric trace gases since the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in the mid 1980s. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the solar influence on ozone of the middle atmosphere, with the focus being on variations on small time scales of less than a month. On the one hand the modulating nature of the 27-day solar rotation signal on stratospheric ozone using a new ozone profile data set from SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) is studied. In this context, common and new frequency analysis techniques help to unravel dominant signals. On the other hand data from the latest version 1.07 Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) tropical ozone (1.27 micrometer as well as the 9.6 micrometer retrieval) and temperature data are studied with respect to daytime variations in the upper mesosphere. The frequency analysis of the 27-day solar rotation signal in SCIAMACHY ozone data (< 20_ latitude, 20-60 km altitude, 2003-2008) was carried out with the help of commonly used tools, like the fast-Fourier transform (FFT) and cross-correlation (CC), but was also supplemented with the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which was not used before in the analysis of satellite ozone data. The CC showed that the maximum correlation between the Mg II index (used in this thesis as solar proxy) and ozone is weaker during the maximum of solar cycle 23 (r = 0.38) than in the previous two solar cycles that have been investigated in earlier studies using different data sets. The magnitude of the ozone signal is highly time dependent and may vanish for several solar rotations even close to solar maximum conditions ...",

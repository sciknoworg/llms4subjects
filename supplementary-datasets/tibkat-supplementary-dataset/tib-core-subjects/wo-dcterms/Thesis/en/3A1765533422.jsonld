            "abstract": "Up to now, a large number of odorants could be identified in food or other natural or synthetical matrices, at times even as (undesired) by-products. Two prominent natural sources of odorous substances are fat and polyphenolic substances such as lignin, bringing about structurally diverse, yet potent and characteristic odorants, namely saturated and unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, as well as phenolic substances such as guaiacols. Despite decades of smell research, odor researchers are still in the process of unveiling potent odorants that await discovery both in nature as well as in modern products. However, this endeavor is nowadays more challenging than ever, as compounds with extraordinarily potent smell predominantly remain unknown as they mostly are present at ultra-trace level. To identify and characterize such unknown odor-active compounds, researchers nowadays commonly utilize a strategy of systematic structural design, considering characteristic smell features, formation pathways, and structural cues obtained from trace odorant analysis. Synthesizing a range of structurally modified targets together with determination of absolute odor thresholds in air and odor qualities then supports discovery of characteristic molecular features related to smell. This approach has been used in the present study for the investigation of different homologues series of fatty acid oxidation products as well as guaiacol derivatives. Besides the consideration of structure-odor correlations within this investigation, inter-individual differences in odor perception were taken into account. All analyses of odor thresholds in air and odor qualities were conducted by means of gas chromatography-olfactometry. The first part of the thesis addresses the investigation of odor properties of different homologues series of fatty acid oxidation products, which are partly already known (naturally occurring) odorants. Homologues series of alka-1,5-dien-3-ones, alk-1-en-3-ones, alka-1,5-dien-3-ols, and alk-1-en-3-ols were synthesized, ...",

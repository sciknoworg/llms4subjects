            "abstract": "Abstract: The degradation of aromatic compounds is of central importance for the global carbon cycle and is accomplished nearly exclusively by microorganisms. Under anaerobic conditions most of the ubiquitous homocyclic, monoaromatic compounds are converted to the central intermediate benzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Dearomatising benzoyl-CoA reductases (BCRs) are key enzymes in the anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds and reduce benzoyl-CoA to a cyclic, conjugated cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA (1,5-dienoyl-CoA). A similar reaction is known in organic chemical synthesis as Birch reduction, which uses alkali metals dissolved in liquid ammonia to generate reductants. Considering the harsh conditions of chemical Birch reduction, it is surprising that BCRs catalyse an analogous reaction under physiological conditions (Boll, 2005b). The midpoint potential of the benzoyl-CoA/1,5-dienoyl-CoA redox pair is one of the most negative for an enzymatic reaction (Kung et al., 2010). The ATP-dependent class I BCRs, which are usually found in facultative anaerobes, have been studied in the past twenty years, though structural insights have not been obtained, yet (Boll and Fuchs, 1995; Boll et al., 1997; Buckel et al., 2014). In contrast, only little is known about the recently identified ATP-independent, tungsten- (W-) containing class II BCRs, that are found in obligate anaerobes such as sulphate reducers, fermenters and some iron reducers (Kung et al., 2009; 2010; L\u00f6ffler et al., 2011). Class II BCRs are complex, consisting of multiple subunits and containing many cofactors (L\u00f6ffler, 2012). Using the obligately anaerobic Fe(III) respiring \u03b4-proteobacterium Geobacter metallireducens as model organism, the structure/function relationship of the active site of the class II BCR was investigated, which comprises the W- and zinc (Zn2+)-containing subunits BamB and the electron-transferring subunit BamC (Kung et al., 2009). A preliminary crystal structure of the BamBC complex showed, that the W in the active site was coordinated by four sulphur ligands from the W-bispyranopterin monophosphate, by a fifth cysteinyl-derived sulphur, and by a sixth inorganic W ligand of unknown nature. The electron density of this sixth W ligand was in line with a sixth sulphur ligand.<br><br>The aim of this thesis was to elucidate the structure/function relationship of a biological Birch-like reduction. In particular, the structural vicinities of the metals W and Zn2+ in the active sit ...",

            "abstract": "This thesis presents experiments on lipid bilayer membranes and non-equilibrium phenomena in active emulsion droplets. In the first part, we outline a concept of self assembled soft matter devices based on micro-fluidics, which use surfactant bilayer membranes as their main building blocks. Membranes form spontaneously when suitable water-in-oil emulsions are forced into micro-fluidic channels at high dispersed-phase volume fractions and are remarkably stable even when pumped through the micro-fluidic channel system. Their geometric arrangement is self-assembling, driven by interfacial energy and wetting forces. The ordered membrane arrays thus emerging can be used to build wet electronic circuitry, with the aqueous droplets as the 'solder points'. Furthermore, the membranes can serve as well-controlled coupling media between chemical processes taking place in adjacent droplets as is shown for the well-known Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction. We also investigate the dynamics of the fusion of vesicles with bilayer membranes. The particular process that we study is the fusion mediated by the SNARE-proteins embedded in the membranes. It is shown that the electrostatic repulsion between the membranes, due to the charged lipids that comprise them, blocks their fusion. Under such conditions ...",

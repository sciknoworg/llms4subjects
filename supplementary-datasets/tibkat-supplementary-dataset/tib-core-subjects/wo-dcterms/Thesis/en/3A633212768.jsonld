            "abstract": "This dissertation has laid emphasis mainly on the reaction chemistry of Bismuth(III) and Aluminum(III) compounds stabilized by sterically bulky ligands. It is comprised of four parts. The first part of the thesis deals with the synthesis of bismuth amide complex and its reaction with compounds containing unsaturated C-O, C-C, and C-N bonds. The main motivation for the research in the field of the bismuth chemistry is the role of bismuth compounds in catalysis and due to their non toxicity in pharmacology. L1BiNMe2 1 was prepared by the reaction of 1,8-bis[(trimethylsilyl)amino]naphthalene with Bi(NMe2)3. To investigate the reactivity of bismuth-nitrogen bond toward carbon-oxygen bond we treated 1 with aldehyde and keton. To extend those findings to carbon-carbon bonds we reacted 1 with alkene and alkine. Due to the basic character of the NMe2 group, compound 1 was utilized to prepare a series of heterobimetallic oxides ...",

            "abstract": "Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) is a nanoporous material with parallel, hexagonally-ordered, cylindrical pores running straight through the material&rsquo;s thickness. A method to deposit highly ordered AAO thin-films, with adjustable 1-10 mm thicknesses, on various surfaces was developed to allow the in-situ study of its dielectric response by optical waveguide spectroscopy (OWS). The Layer-by-Layer deposition within AAO of different types of macromolecules was studied: dendrimer polyelectrolytes, linear polyelectrolytes and proteins. Working at low ionic strength was found to inhibit macromolecular transport within the cylindrical nanopores due to electrostatic repulsion between macromolecules in solution and those adsorbed atop the AAO. Under optimal charge screening conditions, LbL proceeded in a similar fashion as on a planar surface, until multilayer growth became inhibited due to the confined cylindrical geometry that imposes a physical limit to macromolecular deposition and the pore diameter was reduced to 20-35 nm ...",

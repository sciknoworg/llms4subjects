            "abstract": "Abstract: Post-transcriptional alternative splicing (AS) of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is a fundamental process in the gene expression cascade. Via alternative splicing, transcriptome and proteome diversity is massively increased in higher organisms, and recent studies revealed that over 95 % of human and 60 % of Drosophila genes are alternatively spliced (Graveley et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008). However, in general little is known about the impact of AS on developmental processes, about regulatory mechanisms underlying AS, and about the biological role of alternative transcripts. The sex determination pathway of Drosophila serves as a prime example and is the best analyzed splicing network to date. Sex-lethal (Sxl) as the master regulator on top of the sex determination cascade directly regulates sex-specific AS of its own transcript and the pre mRNAs of male-specific lethal 2 (msl-2) which is crucial for dosage compensation, and transformer (tra) encoding another splicing factor (Bashaw & Baker, 1995; Bell et al., 1991; Inoue et al., 1990; Kelley et al., 1997; Nagoshi et al., 1988). Subsequently, Tra together with Transformer2 (Tra2) controls AS of doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru) which in turn encode sex-specific transcription factors (Burtis & Baker, 1989; Ito et al., 1996; Ryner & Baker, 1991; Ryner et al., 1996). <br>In this thesis, Drosophila was used as a model organism to explore the level of sex-specific transcripts in the neural system, to investigate the regulation of AS, and to explore the biological relevance of these transcripts. For this purpose, genome-wide approaches were combined with in vivo genetic and molecular studies. Whole-transcriptome RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses revealed that many more genes besides the classical sex determination factors are sex-specific alternatively spliced in the adult fly head. Further experiments showed that these AS changes are not significantly influenced by signals of the germline or factors which are transferred during mating. The absence of sex-specific transcripts in third instar larval brains further supported the idea of a functional relevance of sex-specific transcripts in adult fly heads. <br>As for most of these alternatively spliced transcripts no prove of functional isoforms already existed, we investigated whether sex-specific isoforms of one of our candidate genes, Tango13, fulfill specific functions. Firstly, we showed that Tango13 transcripts encode two  ...",

            "abstract": "The present work deals with the load-bearing behavior of reinforced concrete slabs. The focus is on the load transfer of concentrated single or block loads, as they occur in bridge structures in the form of wheel loads. However, the findings can also easily be applied to general cases of concentrated block loads on reinforced concrete slabs. In the previous research work on the bearing capacity in shear of reinforced concrete roadway slabs it could be repeatedly stated that the shear bearing capacity of the slabs under single loads is higher than the calculated resistance according to current design rules would expect. Nevertheless, so far no increased bearing capacity could be derived. This discrepancy should be remedied by the present work. After an overview of the field of research and previously performed test series, the research needs and open questions are derived. Based on this, the structural behavior of reinforced concrete slabs under single loads is examined on the basis of large-scale model tests performed at TUHH. From this, one can directly answer many open questions from previous research. In addition, material-non-linear FE simulations are performed to investigate the load transfer of the plates in more detail. The calculations are validated based on the real experiments. It can be shown that the usual fixed relevant design section at the support region is not meaningful, and that the shear forces should be determined close to the concentrated loads. However, these are many times higher than the shear forces at the support of the slab. A hands-on approach to determining the internal forces out of concentrated loads from linearelastic FE calculations is presented and an approach to taking into account the increased load bearing capacity of reinforced concrete slab structures based on the current design equation according to EC2 is proposed. In doing so, the required level of safety in the case of modified proof of the shear bearing capacity is demonstrated by means of a statistical database analysis of selected tests on slabs. It is explained how the direct load transfer of concentrated loads close to the support works phenomenological, and how the failure mechanism of slabs under single loads is related to punching. Finally, it will be shown how the fraction of the inclined compression strut from bending Vccd should be evaluated on haunched slabs.",

            "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a harmful autoimmune disease. In Germany alone about 320.000 people suffer from IBD where particularly ulcerative colitis (UC) patients face a high risk of developing intestinal cancer. It has been previously shown that especially an aberrant regulation of T cells drives the auto-inflammatory processes of IBD. In ulcerative colitis often Th2, Th9 and Th17 cells play a decisive role for its pathogenesis while in Crohn's disease (CD) Th1 and Th17 cells are the main factors for its development. Since the IL-2 inducible tyrosine kinase (ITK) is a key player for the differentiation and function of Th2 and Th9 cells, this enzyme could play an important role in driving the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Up to date there is no cure for IBD and the complexity of the numerous causalities involved in this disease makes it challenging to find one specific target to battle it. Nevertheless, in the last decades a lot of progress has been made and different medications have been discovered that on the one hand dampen the symptoms plus induce remission and on the other hand prolong the remission state in between the acute flares. One of those medications is the immunosuppressant Cyclosporin A (CsA). Although in the beginning it was used to treat patients who have received an organ transplantation, it was later also used in patients with UC. Interestingly, CsA only works in patients with UC but not in those with CD. Why CsA only functions selectively in IBD is not known. Furthermore, also the molecular mechanism behind that remains elusive. A possible explanation could be that CsA impacts an enzyme that is especially prominent in Th2 and Th9 cells rather than Th1 cells and therefore mostly expressed in UC patients. This led to the working hypothesis that CsA might impact the enzyme ITK in UC patients. Therefore, this study focuses on the mechanism of action of CsA as well as the role of ITK in the pathogenesis of IBD. During these studies it was found that ITK, as a potential molecular ...",

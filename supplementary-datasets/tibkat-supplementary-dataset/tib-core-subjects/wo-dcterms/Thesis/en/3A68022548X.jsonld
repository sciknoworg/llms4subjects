            "abstract": "This dissertation lays emphasis mainly on the synthesis and structural studies of oxygen bridged heterobi- and trimetallic complexes containing main group metal, transition metal and f-Elements. In the first part of this work, a series of oxygen-bridged compound with an Al-O-M (M=Zr, Yb, Er, Dy, Y) skeleton were synthesized and characterized. Ethylene polymerization was also studied with the Al-O-M compound using as catalyst. The second part describes the preparation and characterization of oxygen-bridged complexes with Ge-O-M (M=Yb, Y) skeleton. In the third part of this work, some bulky ligands and units were introduced to this system with attempt to synthesize new oxygen-bridged M-O-M' complexes. The last part was focused on the synthesis and X-ray structural studies of f-elements complexes with bulky guanidinato ligand ((Me3Si)2NC(NCy)2). A chlorine-centered cluster of composition [(Me3Si)2NC(NCy)2SmCl2]5(THF)2 and a heavier ytterbium congener [(Me3Si)2NC(NCy)2YbCl2]2(LiCl)2(THF)4 were prepared and characterized. Further research on synthesis of complexes with M-O-Ln and M-O-Ln-O-M moieties was also investigated.",

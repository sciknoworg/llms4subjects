            "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding, double-stranded RNA molecules. In metazoan cells, miRNAs recognize their target mRNAs by imperfectly complementary binding, leading to translational repression or mRNA decay. Because of the importance of miRNAs in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, miRNAs are implicated to be involved in human tumorigenesis. In line with this, decreased levels of global miRNA expression were observed in cancer, and increased number of specific miRNAs has been identified to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. As a transcription factor, p53 regulates many downstream target genes, through which it controls cell fates to maintain genomic integrity. Here, we reported that several miRNA genes (miR-192/194/215) were also p53-responsive. In cancer cells with wild type p53, they were up-regulated in response to the treatment of Nutlin-3 (a small molecule which inhibits Mdm2 and p53 interaction, resulting in p53 stabilization) or DNA damaging agents. All three miRNAs were found to be down-regulated in colon cancers relative to normal colon tissue, suggesting that they might have tumor suppressive activities. To support this, miR-192 suppressed clonogenic survival. Furthermore, miR-192/215 induced cell cycle arrest, which was at least partially dependent on p53 and p21. Overexpression of miR-191/215 in several cancer cell lines induced p53 and its target gene product p21, providing a positive feedback to the p53 pathway. Knockdown of endogenous miR-192 in A549 cells attenuated p53 and p21 activation in response to 5-fluorouracil treatment. Hence, miR-192 and miR-215 act as effectors as well as regulators of p53 ...",

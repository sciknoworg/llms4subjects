            "abstract": "The human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae has maintained only a small repertoire of genes putatively involved in transcription regulation. This reflects its adaption to a nutrient rich and rather constant habitat, the human lung epithelium. To date, the heat shock response regulator HrcA is the only characterized protein involved in transcription regulation in this organism. However, several transcription regulation events have been described, leading to the question which mechanisms or which regulators are responsible for these events. This work aimed to study the implication of the putative, so far uncharacterized regulators in transcription in M. pneumoniae. Screening of a mutant library showed that the majority of the genes encoding these regulators are essential for viability. Only mutants affected in genes relA and whiA, both widely distributed and highly conserved in bacteria, could be isolated from the library. In addition, interaction of protein Mpn266 with RpoA could be shown, providing evidence that this protein is an orthologue of transcription regulator Spx in the Firmicutes. However, this regulator is essential, too. Several experiments have been performed to characterize the role of RelA and the alarmone (p)ppGpp in M. pneumoniae ...",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Highly phosphorylated metabolites, e.g. inositol polyphosphates (InsPs), diphosphoinositol phosphates (PP-InsPs), inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) and Magic spot nucleotides (MSN) regulate various biological processes. Their distinctive role in biology remain still elusive particularly concerning their dynamic turnover. The investigation of their contributions in metabolic processes asks for the development of, in vivo and in vitro, real time analytical detection.<br>In this work the design, synthesis and evaluation of a set of new fluorescent chemosensors is presented, since inositol polyphosphates and polyP are lacking an intrinsic chromophore. The synthesized chemosensors can be divided into the following three categories - Pyrene-excimer based, disassembly approach and DAPI derivatives. A 4\u2019,6-diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI) synthesis was developed in this work. The photophysical properties of the respective set of synthesized chemosensors in combination with the above mentioned phosphorylated metabolites was evaluated. Fe3+-Salen and PyDPA was successfully used as a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) stain and the latter<br>dye was applied as a post-column staining reagent for Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)-hexakisphosphate (InsP6) on an ion chromatography system. In addition, the investigation and application of a new 31P-NMR based method using a chiral solvating agent revealed the stereoselectivity of the first described naturally occurring 1-phytase",

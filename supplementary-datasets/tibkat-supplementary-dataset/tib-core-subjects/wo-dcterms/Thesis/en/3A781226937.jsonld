                "This thesis investigates how emotions arise in the process of goal pursuit. The self-regulation model (Carver & Scheier, 1998) posits that goal progress (velocity) but not goal distance or expectancy impacts affect. These assumptions are in conflict with other theories, such as the self-discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1987) or cognitive appraisal theories of emotion (Arnold, 1960; Lazarus, 1966; Ortony et al., 1988; Reisenzein, 2009). To address these theoretical conflicts a re-formulated self-regulation model was developed integrating goal distance and expectancy predict intensity of emotional reactions. Goal distance and emotion: It was hypothesized that goal distance exerts a direct impact on emotional reactions as well as an indirect impact mediated by expectancy. In addition, goal distance should moderate the impact of goal progress on emotional reactions. Three studies addressed these questions. Study 1 was conducted to develop a novel experimental manipulation of goal distance. Study 2, then, experimentally examined the effect of goal distance. Goal distance affects negative, but not positive emotions, with the effect partially being mediated by expectancy. Unexpectedly, goal distance did not moderate the impact of goal progress on emotions. Study 3 experimentally examined the effects of goal distance as well as goal progress. In this case, the goal distance did not yield any significant effects on emotion. For this reason, a regression analysis was conducted. Goal ...",

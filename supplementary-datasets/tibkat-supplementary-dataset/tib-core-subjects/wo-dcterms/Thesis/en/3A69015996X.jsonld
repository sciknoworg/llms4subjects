            "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an intracellular protein kinase that plays a key role in the control of cell growth, differentiation, cell survival, and cell proliferation. In humans, mTOR deregulation is implicated in parasitic, fungal, bacterial and viral infections, immune disorders, diabetes, obesity, cardiac diseases, renal abnormalities, and various cancers. mTOR was first identified as TOR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It exists in two structurally and functionally distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1, a rapamycin sensitive protein complex, senses the availability of growth factors, nutrients, cellular energy levels, and is actively involved in cellular transcription and translation processes. mTORC1 performs a range of biological functions with the help of its interacting proteins. These interacting proteins act as scaffolds and recruit substrates and regulatory proteins required for mTOR kinase function. The present study was undertaken to identify novel interacting partners of mTORC1 that specifically interact with mTORC1 to enable this crucial cell signaling hub to carry out its biological functions ...",

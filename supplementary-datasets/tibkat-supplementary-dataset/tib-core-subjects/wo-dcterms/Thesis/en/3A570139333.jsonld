            "abstract": "Lake sediments are among those environmental archives with the highest possible temporal resolution, and have been used to reconstruct the environmental history in lake-catchment areas and to asses continental climate changes since the last glaciation. Magnetic methods offer the possibility of a fast and non-destructive characterization of sediments, and are used to develop so-called magnetic proxies for the reconstruction of the environmental history. However, the relation between the magnetic minerals, their magnetic properties and the environment is complex and not completely understood. The present work is concerned with the improvement of basic knowledges about the properties of magnetic particles in sediments as weIl as with the development of a quantitative method for the characterization of magnetic mineral sources. Representative sediment sampies from various continental, marine and lacustrine environments have been analyzed in order to investigate the effects of natural processes on their magnetic properties. The magnetic mineral sources could be divided into few categories with characteristic magnetic properties and a common process of formation. These sources include detrital particles transported by water and air, ultrafine magnetite formed in soils and marine or lacustrine sediments, two types of magnetite particles produced by magnetotactic bacteria, maghemite produced in loesses by weathering processes, and a mixture of fly-ash and metallic particles associated to the urban pollution...",

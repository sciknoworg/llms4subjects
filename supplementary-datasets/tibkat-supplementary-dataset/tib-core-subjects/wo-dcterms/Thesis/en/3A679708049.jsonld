            "abstract": "The brain processes sensory information about the outside world in large complex networks of neurons which communicate with short electrical pulses called action potentials or spikes. The details of the way information is processed in the brain are not yet well understood. An important boundary condition in this respect is the intrinsic dynamics of neural networks. Yet its quantitative analysis has so far been elusive due to the high complexity of these systems. In this thesis a novel approach is introduced to precisely characterize the collective dynamics and quantify the information preservation and erasure of large networks of spiking neurons. This approach is based on analaytic solutions of the single neuron dynamics and numerically exact simulations, and the calculation of the whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. It can be directly applied to arbitrary network topologies and single neuron phase-response curves. This approach is applied to neural networks in the balanced state. The balanced state is the prevailing explanation of the asynchronous irregular activity observed in cortical networks. This irregularity arises due to strongly fluctuating inputs to the neurons that are a result of a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition. While the emergence and the statistics of the balanced state are rather well understood, its dynamical nature has been discussed controversially ...",

                "There is a growing interest in the application of non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma for the treatment of wounds. Due to the generation of various ROS and RNS, UV radiation and electric fields plasma is a very promising tool which can stimulate skin and immune cells. However, not much is known about the mammalian cell responses after plasma treatments on a molecular level. The present work focusses on the impact of plasma on cell signaling in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT by using the methods DNA microarray, qPCR, ELISA and flow cytometry. Here, cell signaling mediators such as cytokines and growth factors which could promote wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis, reepithelization, migration and proliferation were of major interest. Additionally, the crosstalk between keratinocytes and monocytes was studied using a co-culture. For the first time extensive investigations on the impact of plasma on cell signaling in human keratinocytes were conducted. The most prominent cytokines and growth factors which were regulated by plasma at gene and protein level were VEGF-A, GM-CSF, HB-EGF, IL-8, and IL-6. The latter was not activated due to the JAK/STAT-pathway but probably by a combined activation of MAPK- and PI3K/Akt-pathways. By the use of conditioned medium it was found out that ROS and RNS generated directly after plasma treatment induced larger effects on cell signaling in keratinocytes than the subsequently secreted growth factors and cytokines.

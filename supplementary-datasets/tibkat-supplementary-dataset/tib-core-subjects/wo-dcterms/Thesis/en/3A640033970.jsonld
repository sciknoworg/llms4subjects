            "abstract": "Mobile Learning, Mobile Technology, People with Mental Disabilities, Pedagogy, Learning Process, Interactive Learning Environments, Inclusive Design, and Accessibility. - The domain of learning context for people with special needs is a big challenge for digi- tal media in education. This thesis describes the main ideas and the architecture of a system called Intelligent Mobile Learning Interaction System (IMLIS) that provides a mobile learning environment for people with mental disabilities. The design of IMLIS aims to enhance personalization aspects by using a decision engine, which makes deci- sions based on the user s abilities, learning history and reactions to processes. It allows for adaptation, adjustment and personalization of content, learning activities, and the user interface on different levels in a context where learners and teachers are targeting autonomous learning by personalized lessons and feedback. Due to IMLIS dynamic structure and flexible patterns, it is able to meet the specific needs of individuals and to engage them in learning activities with new learning motivations. In addition to support- ing learning material and educational aspects, mobile learning fosters learning across context and provides more social communication and collaboration for its users. The suggested methodology defines a comprehensive learning process for the mentally disabled to support them in formal and informal learning. We apply knowledge from the field of research and practice to people with mental disabilities, as well as discuss the pedagogical and didactical aspects of the design.",

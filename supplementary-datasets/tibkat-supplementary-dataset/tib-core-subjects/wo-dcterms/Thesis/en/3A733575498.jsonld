                "In this thesis, all three BVMOs from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB10007, that were known to be responsible for the ability of this strain to degrade camphor since the 1950s were successfully made available as recombinant biocatalysts. While the genomic sequence of 2,5-DKCMO was available from the database, the genes encoding 3,6-DKCMO and OTEMO had to be identified using certain PCR-techniques first. All three enzymes were cloned into standard plasmids enabling convenient expression in E. coli facilitating the application of the enzymes in organic chemistry. Their synthetic potential was already reported during the 1990s, but at that time their efficient application was limited due to difficulties with respect to low production levels and insufficient purity and separation of enzyme fractions. These drawbacks are now overcome. Furthermore, biochemical characterization of the camphor-degrading BVMOs was performed including the substrate spectra of these enzymes. Thereby OTEMO turned out not only to have a broad substrate scope accepting mono- and bicyclic aliphatic and arylaliphatic ketones, but also to efficiently convert alpha/beta-unsaturated cycloalkanones due to the similarity of these compounds to OTEMOs natural substrate. Finally, the major limitation in the synthetic application of Type II BVMOs was addressed by searching a flavin-reductase suitable for coupling to these two-component oxygenases. Putative candidates from the respective P. putida strain were identified by the ...",

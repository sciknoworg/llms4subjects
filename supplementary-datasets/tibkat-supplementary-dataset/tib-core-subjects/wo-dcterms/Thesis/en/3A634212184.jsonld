            "abstract": "The present study deals with the synoptic and dynamic aspects of heat low developments associated with the penetration of an extratropical upper level trough into tropical West Africa. During the AMMA project (African Monsoon - Multidisciplinary Analysis), a large field campaign during the year 2006 took place in several West African countries. The collected data set is unique with respect to its diversity and its spatial and temporal density. Thus, this study is focusing to the year 2006 and the dry and the transition seasons are of special interest. Using a subjective identification method, 140 days with a tropical plume (TP) occurrence where identified during 2006 and grouped into 29 events. TPs are the most prominent feature of tropical-extratropical interactions and visible in infrared-satellite imagery. Three events were chosen for further, more detailed investigations. The first event (06 - 18 February 2006) is characterized by a heat low development over North Benin, West Niger and eastern Burkina Faso and heavy rains along the Guinea Coast. The second case (19 - 30 May 2006) occurred during the transition season from the dry to the wet conditions prior to the monsoon season ...",

            "abstract": "The general goal of this thesis was to compare effects of competitive, neutral, and cooperative outcome interdependence between monetary rewards, on the individual- as well as on the group level. It was aimed at drawing conclusions about the expedient implementability of the different outcome interdependences in work life. To answer this question, effects were assessed on two different categories of variables: (a) reward-maximizing behavior; (b) perceptions of pay satisfaction, stress levels, and fairness. By this approach the psychological view on payment strategies was extended: It was not only investigated if competitive, neutral, or cooperative outcome interdependence caused adapted behavioral responses in order to maximize individual payouts. It was also focused how (un-)successful individuals perceived the accordant form of outcome interdependence. In study 1 and study 2, the computer-based multi-agent game HoneyComb (Boos et al., in prep.; Pritz, 2011) was used to assess behavioral responses to (a) the pure visibility of group members on a virtual playground without rewards (study 1); (b) behavioral and perceptional responses to neutral vs. competitive outcome interdependence within a monetary reward (study 2). In study 1, it was found that without rewards participants showed an implicit tendency to approach their neighbors, if visible. This tendency to flock was then significantly influenced by individual-based rewards in study 2: When competitive outcome interdependence was implemented, participants actively heightened spatial distance to their group members and coevally speeded up their movements ...",

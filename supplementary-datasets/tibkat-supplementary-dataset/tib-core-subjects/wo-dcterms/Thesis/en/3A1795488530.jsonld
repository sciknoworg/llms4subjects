            "abstract": "Tumors utilize multiple strategies to evade the recognition and eradication by the immune system enabling outgrowth and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. There is increasing data that also tumor metabolism plays a role in tumor immune escape. Metabolic changes in cancer cells lead to the depletion of essential nutrients and the accumulation of suppressive metabolites within the tumor microenvironment, which can critically impair antitumor immune responses. One tumor-specific metabolic dysregulation represents the deficiency of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), a central enzyme of the methionine and polyamine metabolism. Loss of MTAP expression can be found in various tumor entities and often correlates with tumor progression and stage of disease. Lack of MTAP activity leads to the accumulation of the substrate 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA). Many studies have already reported that this tumor metabolite suppresses various types of immune cells. In this context, MTA was shown to impair the proliferation, viability, differentiation, and effector function of human primary cytotoxic T cells. Further investigation should elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the MTA-mediated T-cell inhibition and, based on this, examine putative strategies to overcome the immunosuppression by MTA. MTA was found to interfere with different intracellular pathways, especially signaling through AKT, a key regulator of many essential cellular functions, such as growth, survival, and metabolism. In line with this, MTA impaired upregulation of glycolysis and fatty acid consumption after T-cell stimulation, which is crucial for T-cell functionality. In addition, MTA was found to inhibit protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) activity. In comparison studies, the selective PRMT5 inhibitor EPZ015666 suppressed the proliferation, viability, differentiation, cytokine secretion, and tumor antigen-specific expansion of human primary cytotoxic T cells similar to MTA. Furthermore, PRMT5 inhibition decreased the ...",

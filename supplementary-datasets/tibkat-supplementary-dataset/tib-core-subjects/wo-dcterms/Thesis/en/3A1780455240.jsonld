            "abstract": "In this thesis highly hierarchical ordered hybrid structures in form of shell-by-shell (SbS)-functionalized metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were investigated. Such hybrid materials were manufactured, characterized, and used for a couple of studies in different projects (P1 - P6). Within the framework of this projects, the surface properties of SbS-functionalized metal oxide NPs should be studied concerning their dispersibility/surface wetting, optical and opto-electronic properties, electronic properties, and regarding to their biomedical benefits. Starting from the pristine metal oxide NP dispersion, initially a wet-chemical implementation with phosphonic acid derivatives was realized resulting in the formation of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) onto the metal oxide surface. The second functionalization step was also wet-chemically carried out and consisted of a self-assembly attachment of amphiphiles onto first-shell functionalized NPs, driven by solvophobic interactions. Within the SbS-functionalization, the dispersibility behavior of the NPs changed two times, each time after a functionalization step was fulfilled. The step-by-step functionalization of the metal oxide NPs was precisely described of going from the pristine metal oxide NPs, to first-shell functionalized NPs, and finally to SbS-functionalized NPs. The NPs of different functionalization degree were characterized with an assortment of the following measurements: dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), static contact angle (SCA), fluorescence-, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. In the first project of the thesis, the SbS-functionalization of TiO2 NPs towards an orthogonally adjustable dispersibility in hydrocarbons, fluorocarbons, and water was achieved (P1). Simultaneously to the adjustable dispersibility of the NPs in different solvent media, also the surface wetting properties in form of total surface energies of the NP films in the solid state were tuned.

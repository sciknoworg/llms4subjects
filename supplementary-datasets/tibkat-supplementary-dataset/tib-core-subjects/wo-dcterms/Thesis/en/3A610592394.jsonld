            "abstract": "The soil organic matter pool represents a major part of the terrestrial carbon reservoir. Decomposition of soil organic matter contributes to important fluxes of the global carbon cycle. In order to understand, assess, and predict the impact of land use or climatic changes in the tropics, quantitative knowledge of stabilization and decomposition processes of soil organic matter is necessary. This thesis elucidated how soil properties and land use influence the carbon storage in bulk soil and in physically and chemically defined soil fractions. Furthermore, the stability of older forest-derived carbon and the stability of recently incorporated pasture-derived carbon in these fractions were investigated. For this purpose, fractionation procedures were combined with 13C isotope analyses on soil samples from sites that had undergone a land use change (natural forest > pasture, natural forest > pasture > secondary forest) which was connected with a vegetation change from C3 to C4 or from C3 to C4 to C3 plants. Soil sampling was conducted in the humid tropics in northwest Ecuador. Soils developed from different parent material (marine Tertiary sediments and volcanic ashes) differing in key factors which influence storage and stabilisation of soil organic matter ...",

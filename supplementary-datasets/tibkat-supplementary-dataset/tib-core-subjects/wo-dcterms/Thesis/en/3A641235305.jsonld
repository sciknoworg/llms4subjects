            "abstract": "Infrared heterodyne spectroscopy today is an inherent part in planetary atmosphere observations. It is based on the superposition of the observed signal to a local oscillator and provides highest possible spectral resolution. Non-thermal emission of CO2 in the upper mesosphere of Venus was discovered by the NASA Infrared Heterodyne Spectrometer (IRHS) in the 1970s and was repeatedly target of observations since then. In the course of this thesis, data of with IRHS, its successor HIPWAC and the Cologne Tuneable Heterodyne Infrared Spectrometer (THIS) was taken or analysed. From the measured line widths the kinetic temperature of the atmosphere at the emission altitude of around 115 km could be determined. Observed temperatures are generally higher than predicted by the Venus International Reference Atmosphere (VIRA). VIRA is a empirical model mainly based on data of the Pioneer Venus space mission and exhibits only a limited data set. Other ground-based observations as well as results from Venus Express confirm the warm atmosphere at similar altitudes. At the day side of Venus and at this specific altitude, infrared heterodyne spectroscopy is currently the only method to observe temperatures. Another result is the high variability of the observed atmosphere which is not expected by the VIRA model but which was also seen in earlier mm-wavelength observations ...",

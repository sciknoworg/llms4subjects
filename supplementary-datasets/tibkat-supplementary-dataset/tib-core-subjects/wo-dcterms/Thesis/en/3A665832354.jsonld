            "abstract": "Macropore flow describes the fast movement of water in structural features like wormholes, root channels, or cracks in soils. The influence of macropore flow on infiltration, transport of solutes, and the generation of runoff is generally accepted; however, the mechanisms controlling macropore flow are not very well known. Concentrating on soils containing macropores built by earthworms, this study observed and analysed in detail macropore flow processes during flood producing rainfall events. Combined sprinkling and dye tracer experiments with different rainfall intensities and initial soil moisture conditions were carried out on four sites in Switzerland. The experimental set-up allowed the observation of macropore flow initiation and interaction at a high spatial and temporal resolution. The sites were selected to cover a wide variety of properties that can influence macropore flow. However, the land-use was restricted to grassland to ensure an undisturbed development of the macropore network and all sites were located on hillslopes to be able to measure overland flow. The experiments provided detailed soil water regime measurements in order to detect water content changes in different depths and to determine the time of saturation and the saturation deficit at the beginning of the experiment.",

            "abstract": "The overall goal of this study was to develop possible controlling approaches for dairy cattle breeding programs. For this reason different topics from practical dairy cattle breeding were studied. Initially, genetic and environmental impact factors on auction prices of first lactation Holstein cows were analysed. Subsequently, a possible selection strategy for informative cooperator herds in progeny test programs was developed and its impact on a breeding program for Holstein cows was studied. Finally, an approach for the management of genetic variability in dairy cattle populations was applied to a set of preselected potential bull dams and sires, using additive genetic and genomic relationships ...",

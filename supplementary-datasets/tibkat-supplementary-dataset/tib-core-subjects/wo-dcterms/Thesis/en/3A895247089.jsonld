            "abstract": "Biomedical imaging helps extending our comprehension of ourselves and our environment. Advances in camera, laser and computation technologies have enabled an ever-increasing number of imaging technologies. Imaging with visible and infrared light has the advantage that it is less harmful than other radiation and its wavelength is in the order of magnitude of cells and subcellular components. Fluorescence microscopy provides good chemical contrast and multi-colour imaging can help elucidate cellular architecture. Incoherent superresolution methods permit us to bypass Abbe's diffraction limit of lateral resolution and visualize previously unnoticed details. Coherent imaging methods such as optical coherence tomography or holoscopy do not require any previous labelling and have the advantage that they record both the amplitude and phase of the light emitted from a scattering sample by interferometric superposition with a reference wave. Both incoherent an coherent imaging methods are used in this thesis. The results of two interdisciplinary research collaborations using different fluorescence microscopy methods, including superresolution methods, are presented. Podosomes in macrophages were studied with stimulated emission depletion microscopy, structured illumination microscopy and localisation microscopy and a distinctly polygonal shape in their vinculin rings was found. Image processing routines allowed for a quantitative analysis of the acquired images [1]. In the second study, chlorophyll, the most prominent natural pigments, and digested chlorophyll metabolites were detected in gut section of the herbivorous Spodoptera littoralis larva. Widefield and high-resolution autofluorescence microscopy revealed that the brush border membranes of their gut are covered with the chlorophyllide binding protein tightly bound to the gut membrane. A function in defense against gut microbes is discussed [2]. ...",

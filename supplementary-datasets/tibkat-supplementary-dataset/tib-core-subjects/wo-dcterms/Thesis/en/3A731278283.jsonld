            "abstract": "Worldwide declines in biodiversity have prompted concerns about the functioning of ecosystems that may rely on it. This is also true for the pollination of plants, which is essential for the reproduction and thus long-term survival of most species and also an important ecosystem service essential for the production of many agricultural products. Animal species providing this service, particularly bees, are experiencing severe declines. In this thesis, I address the multifaceted aspects of the functional relevance of wild bee diversity, in the context of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research that so far has primarily focused on primary productivity and consumptive interactions. The scientific background and important concepts are reviewed in chapter 1. With a biodiversity experiment establishing caged communities of one to five bee species, chapter 2 shows that multiple bee species provide greater pollination services to a plant community than one bee species alone, and that the mechanism of this pollinator diversity effect is functional complementarity. Functional complementarity in the pollination of plant communities was determined by flower preferences that are partly a consequence of interspecific competition leading to increased visitation to poorly visited plant species. Furthermore, bumble bees are particularly important pollinators because they forage under weather conditions when most solitary bees are inactive. These differences explain why multiple species are needed to pollinate a plant community completely. Chapter 3 focuses on within-day temporal patterns of plant-pollinator interactions. In a first step, the influence of pollination on the daily pattern of flower opening and closure known as Linn\u00e9's floral clock\u02ba is tested for a group of Asteraceae in a set of experiments. Flower heads closed rapidly in response to pollination, but were open until late afternoon otherwise. This finding contrasts to previous work attributing the time of flower closure to abiotic or endogenous factors only. In a second step, the consequences of this pattern for plant-pollinator networks are examined. Depending on plant species composition, early flower closure drives strong temporal dynamics in plant-pollinator interactions ...",

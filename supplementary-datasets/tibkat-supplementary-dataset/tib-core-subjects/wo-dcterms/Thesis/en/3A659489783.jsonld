            "abstract": "This study picks up the discussion about mycotoxins as risks in human nutrition and deals with the purpose to advance risk communication to the consumer. There are three major questions: How do consumers experience mycotoxin risks? What are consumers&rsquo; attitudes towards a label signifying food in which mycotoxins can not be detected? Which factors influence consumer&rsquo;s risk perception towards mycotoxins and attitude towards a mycotoxin free\u02ba-food label? Data evaluation is based on 696 interviews with consumers from Northern Germany. Attitude is measured by interviews (stated preferences) and by behaviour preferences (revealed preferences). Discrete-choice-analysis, partial-least-squares-analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and variance analysis are used. Results show a low awareness of health problems due to mycotoxin contamination of food. Mycotoxin risks are under-estimated by consumers. However, a mycotoxin free\u02ba-food label is evaluated positively by consumers. A combined front- and back-label can supply very diverse information requirements. Furthermore, risk perception towards mycotoxins is significantly affected by uncertainty about food safety, by the potential of mycotoxins to induce dread, by the credibility of additional information and by attitude towards a mycotoxin free\u02ba-food label. Attitude towards the label is influenced by label design. Further studies should ideally clarify how a mycotoxin free\u02ba-food label can be integrated into a comprehensive risk management system and what risk communication strategies seem to be promising in the light of low consumers&rsquo; awareness of mycotoxin-induced health problems.",

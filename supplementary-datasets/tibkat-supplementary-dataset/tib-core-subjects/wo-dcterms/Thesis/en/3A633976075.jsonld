            "abstract": "Tsunami, numerical model, finite element, unstructured mesh, adaptive mesh. -  The devastating Sumatra-Andaman tsunami of December 2004, is a milestone for the international community striving to introduce measures to prevent hazards from (future) tsunamis. One of the measures is numerical modeling which plays a key role for predictions as well as inundation mapping developments. Numerical modeling has been used as a tool for analyzing and reconstructing tsunamis for almost 40 years. Nowadays, many tsunami codes are available as open-source or free-ware and widely used in the tsunami modeling community. Many numerical methods have been applied such as finite difference, finite element and finite volume. The same applies to gridding methods, such as structured and unstructured non-adaptive types. This thesis introduces a new triangle-based adaptive mesh finite element model for tsunami propagation (and inundation) simulations. TsunaFLASH combines a numerical method developed in the framework of the unstructured triangular element, yet non-adaptive, tsunami model TsunAWI with adaptive mesh refinement capabilities provided by the library amatos. The methods are well suited for accurate resolution of localized features, maintaining computational efficiency in terms of the number of computations and the required memory. In this first developments of TsunaFLASH, a number of experiments have been performed for testing. There are: An experiments on various initial conditions, from an analytical source up to a coupling to the sophisticated rupture generator RuptGen; experiments with diverse error estimators for testing refinement criteria and adaptation algorithms; benchmark experiments using analytical solutions and field observations where the analytical solution is derived from the first benchmark problem from The International LongWaves reference; and the sea surface elevation in the field data experiment is used from the satellite tracks of Jason-1 and Topex for verification of the Sumatra- Andaman mega-tsunami 2004 event, while the water level reading of DART 23401 is used for the verification of the Andaman minor tsunami 2009 ...",

            "title": "Bandwidth selection in nonparametric kernel estimation",
            "abstract": "Kernel estimation is a common nonparametric method for data based estimation of densities or regression functions. Although one may consider nonparametric estimation as a procedure that does not involve parameters, one has to estimate bandwidth parameters. The difference to parameter based estimation of e.g. density functions is that no specific form of the nonparametric density has to be assumed. This makes nonparametric estimation methods more flexible. This thesis compromises three parts. The first part covers bandwidth selection in kernel density estimation, which is a common tool for empirical studies in many research areas. The discussion about finding the optimal bandwidth based on the data has been going on over three decades. The typical aim of empirical studies in the past was mostly to show that a new method outperforms existing ones. Review articles on comparing methods are very rare and were written a long time ago. Hence, the first part of this thesis is an update review of existing methods comparing them on a set of different designs. The second part is on bandwidth selection in nonparametric kernel regression. The aim is similar to the first part: reviewing and comparing existing methods on a set of designs. In part one and two, smooth densities of a random variable X were assumed, therefore global bandwidth selection is adequate for the kernel estimation. In contrast to the first two parts we assume a density of X with a sharp peak and smooth areas in the third part. Usually local bandwidth selection is used in this case. However, we want to apply global bandwidth selection methods and hence, it is tested if good results can be obtained by a prior transformation. Therefore, part three covers a comparison between using a transformation and estimating the global bandwidth without a transformation. The main question is whether an improvement with respect to the typical error criteria in nonparametric regression can be made by using a prior transformation.",

            "abstract": "The genetic modification of T cells for the expression a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) endows them with a new specificity for an antigen. Adoptive immunotherapy with CD19-CAR T cells has achieved high rates of sustained complete remissions in B cell malignancies. However, the downregulation or loss of the targeted antigen after mono-specific CAR T cell therapy, e.g. against CD19 or CD22, has been reported. Targeting multiple antigens on tumour cells, sequentially or simultaneously, could overcome this limitation. Additionally, targeting multiple antigens with CAR T cells could drive the translation from hematologic malignancies to prevalent solid cancers, which often express tumour-associated antigens heterogeneously. We hypothesised that expression of a universal CAR, which can be programmed with hapten-like molecules, could endow T cells with specificities for multiple antigens. In this study we introduce a novel chemically programmable CAR (cpCAR) based on monoclonal antibody h38C2. Our data show, that cpCARs form a reversible chemical bond to molecules containing a diketone-group and therefore can be programmed to acquire multiple specificities. We programmed cpCAR T cells with hapten-like compounds against integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b14\u03b21 as well as the folate receptor. We observed tumour cell lysis, IFN \u0263 and IL-2 production and proliferation of programmed cpCAR T cells against tumour cells expressing the respective target antigen in vitro. As a reference to cpCARs programmed against \u03b1v\u03b23, we further introduced novel conventional \u03b1v\u03b23-CARs. These CARs, based on humanised variants of monoclonal antibody LM609 (hLM609), directly bind to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 via their scFv. The four \u03b1v\u03b23-CAR constructs comprised either an scFv with higher affinity (hLM609v7) or lower affinity (hLM609v11) against \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin and either a long (IgG4 hinge, CH2, CH3) or short (IgG4 hinge) extracellular spacer. We selected the hLM609v7-CAR with short spacer, which showed potent anti-tumour reactivity both in vitro and in a murine xenograft ...",

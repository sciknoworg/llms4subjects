            "title": "A dual independence complex",
            "abstract": "In the present work we apply the concept of duality to the simplicial complex of independent (stable) sets of graphs, the so called independence complex. We prove that this complex can be dualized for the case of paths and cycles. The result is a dual independence complex, which is a regular cell complex with surprising structures. Although it contains the same topological information as the non-dual complex its homeomorphism type is \"nicer\". The independence complex of a cycle, for example, is either homotopy equivalent to a sphere or to a wedge of two spheres. In general, it is a non-pure complex. The corresponding dual independence complex has the same homotopy type. Moreover, it is homeomorphic to a sphere or to a sphere with a third hemisphere. In order to provide the basic tools for this theory we start by studying trees. First we define for every tree T its dual independence poset DIP(T). Its elements are the independent sets I whose links in the indepencence complex IC(T) are not contractible. The partial order on DIP(T) is given by reverse inclusion. We prove that for every path P this poset DIP(P) is graded, has the diamond property and has a recursive coatom ordering. These properties imply that there is a regular cell complex DIC(P) with face poset DIP(P). We show that this complex is a shellable ball, its dimension is determined by the length of the path P. Similarly, we prove for each cycle C that there is a regular cell complex DIC(C) with face poset DIP(C). We show that this dual independence complex DIC(C) is shellable and has the homeomorphism type described above. Finally, we show that the symmetry group of the complex DIC(C) is a dihedral group. We prove similar results for trees. We show for all trees T that the poset DIP(T) is graded and has the diamond property. These proofs for trees are very similar to the special cases of paths. At the heart of all these proofs is a classification of the nodes of trees into six different types: wolves, dogs, living and dead sheep, toadstools and mushrooms. We conjecture that for each tree T the poset DIP(T) is the poset of a regular cell complex. In other words, we conjecture that the independence complexes of all trees can be dualized. We conclude with a discussion of this conjecture.",

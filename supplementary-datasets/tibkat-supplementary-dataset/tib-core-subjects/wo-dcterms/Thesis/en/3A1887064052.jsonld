            "abstract": "Graphitic carbon nitrides (g-CNs) are represented by melon-type g-CN, poly(heptazine imides) (PHIs), triazine-based g-CN and poly(triazine imide) with intercalated LiCl (PTI/Li+Cl\u2012). These materials are composed of sp2-hybridized carbon and nitrogen atoms; C:N ratio is close to 3:4; the building unit is 1,3,5-triazine or tri-s-triazine; the building units are interconnected covalently via sp2-hybridized nitrogen atoms or NH-moieties; the layers are assembled into a stack via weak van der Waals forces as in graphite. Due to medium band gap (~2.7 eV) g-CNs, such as melon-type g-CN and PHIs, are excited by photons with wavelength \u2264 460 nm. Since 2009 g-CNs have been actively studied as photocatalysts in evolution of hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 two half-reactions of full water splitting, by employing corresponding sacrificial agents. At the same time application of g-CNs as photocatalysts in organic synthesis has been remaining limited to few reactions only. Cumulative Habilitation summarizes research work conducted by the group \u2018Innovative Heterogeneous Photocatalysis\u2019 between 2017-2023 in the field of carbon nitride organic photocatalysis, which is led by Dr. Oleksandr Savatieiev.

            "abstract": "Since elemental magnesium was isolated by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1808 it was used for the first time for a medical application in the form of a wire to seal blood vessels in the year 1878 by the physician Edward C. Huse. In recent years, research has been focused more intensively on this very special and reactive metallic material. The major advantage is its biocompatibility combined with biodegradability which spares the necessity of a second surgery if applied as a bone replacement material. Disadvantages are the (initially) too high corrosion speed and the therefore resulting hydrogen evolution. In clinical in vivo studies with magnesium-based implants, gas formation underneath the skin has been reported to be an issue as well as fast alkalization of the surrounding tissue. Until now, a limited number of licensed medical products such as stents are commercially available and being used. A way to overcome the aforementioned issues is to apply coatings to magnesium and its alloys to reduce and adapt the corrosion rate. Alloying itself is already part of the strategy to control the corrosion behaviour and to reduce corrosion. In this doctoral thesis and the research presented in the following chapters, a WE43 magnesium alloy containing approximately 3.6 wt% Y, 3.4 wt% Nd and 0.1 wt% Zr was used. Apart from applications in the automotive and aerospace industry, WE43 has been also proven to possess desirable properties as bone screws and cardiovascular stents in medical applications. As a first step the alloy itself was investigated to collect information about the metallurgical microstructure of the extruded rods. Subsequently, one of the aims was to make this alloy accessible to the advanced coating method of electrophoretic deposition (EPD). This was not only to tailor the corrosion speed but also to functionalize the surface using bioactive 45S5 glass in co-deposition with the biopolymer chitosan. This method allows fast coating procedures even for complex geometries at room temperature while the coating ...",

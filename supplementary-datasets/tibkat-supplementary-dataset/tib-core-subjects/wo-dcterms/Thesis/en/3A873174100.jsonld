                "This study sets out to examine the potential of COMET occupational competence diagnostic model to assess and develop occupational competence in TVET. Holistic problem solving competence grounded in the COMET three-dimensional model, eight COMET criteria and Work Process Knowledge is a key element in this study. TVET is frequently seen as an instrument to address socio-economic and political challenges at a national and global level. The significance of a well-defined occupational competence assessment tool to advance quality assurance in TVET is accentuated by the high expectations of TVET to mitigate global concerns. Central to the debate around high youth unemployment is the issue of student occupational competence and workplace readiness to access the opportunities created by government policies and strategies. A mixed methodological approach consisting of qualitative and quantitative research methods was adopted. Cross-sectional data as well as elements of longitudinal data was collected from 715 participants comprising of students and artisans from six Public TVET Colleges, two Private TVET Institutions and three Industry Academies. The highest percentage of students (34,4%) ranged between ages 21-24. COMET Large-Scale Open-ended Test Tasks were conducted in measuring the occupational competence of TVET students to solve domain specific, complex problems, holistically. Four context questionnaires and semi-structured focus group interviews complete the assessment methods for data collection. COMET psychometric model and IBM SPSS version 22 were predominantly used to analyse the data collected. Findings of this study provide strong evidence that qualifications do not guarantee the development of occupational competence amongst students. The typical applied curriculum appears to be insufficient in preparing TVET students for the 21st century, modern work where reflective, divergent thinking and holistic problem solving competence has become the norm. 60.4% of students are at risk at Nominal Competence level and merely 11.4% achieved Holistic Shaping Competence. Functional Competence was achieved by 14.9% and 13.1% of students achieved Processual Competence. Students in the pilot dual system apprenticeship programme (DSAP) exposed to a real work situation, acquired higher occupation competence levels in comparison to sole College based peers. Stagnation in the development of occupational competence over three years of training is a major finding. Occupational commitment and motivation of students was high contrary to poor holistic problem solving competence. Arising from these findings, COMET occupational competence diagnostic model is proposed to position TVET to assess and develop value related occupational competence in TVET. This study supports COMET pedagogy of accumulative occupational competence in developing students from a novice to an expert skilled professional."

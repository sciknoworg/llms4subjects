            "abstract": "The superordinate aim of my work towards this thesis was a better understanding of the relationship between mental models and the underlying principles that lead to the self-organization of neuronal circuitry. The thesis consists of four individual publications, which approach this goal from differing perspectives. While the formation of sparse coding representations in neuronal substrate has been investigated extensively, many research questions on how sparse coding may be exploited for higher cognitive processing are still open. The first two studies, included as chapter 2 and chapter 3, asked to what extend representations obtained with sparse coding match mental models. We identified the following selectivities in sparse coding representations: with stereo images as input, the representation was selective for the disparity of image structures, which can be used to infer the distance of structures to the observer. Furthermore, it was selective to the predominant orientation in textures, which can be used to infer the orientation of surfaces. With optic flow from egomotion as input, the representation was selective to the direction of egomotion in 6 degrees of freedom. Due to the direct relation between selectivity and physical properties, these representations, obtained with sparse coding, can serve as early sensory models of the environment. The cognitive processes behind spatial knowledge rest on mental models that represent the environment. We presented a topological model for wayfinding in the third study, included as chapter 4. It describes a dual population code, where the first population code encodes places by means of place fields, and the second population code encodes motion instructions based on links between place fields. We did not focus on an implementation in biological substrate or on an exact fit to physiological findings. The model is a biologically plausible, parsimonious method for wayfinding, which may be close to an intermediate step of emergent skills in an evolutionary navigational hierarchy. Our automated testing for visual performance in mice, included in chapter 5, is an example of behavioral testing in the perception-action cycle. The goal of this study was to quantify the optokinetic reflex. Due to the rich behavioral repertoire of mice, quantification required many elaborate steps of computational analyses. Animals and humans are embodied living systems, and therefore composed of strongly enmeshed modules or entities, which are also enmeshed with the environment. In order to study living systems as a whole, it is necessary to test hypothesis, for example on the nature of mental models, in the perception-action cycle. In summary, the studies included in this thesis extend our view on the character of early sensory representations as mental models, as well as on high-level mental models for spatial navigation. Additionally it contains an example for the evaluation of hypotheses in the perception-action cycle.",

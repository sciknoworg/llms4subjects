            "abstract": "Abstract: Streptomycetes are an important source of biogenic drugs. The production of these compounds is often associated with complex changes within these organisms. In addition to morphological differentiation, such as the formation of aerial hyphae and spore chains, the cells globally reorganize their metabolic machinery. This phenomenon is known as metabolic switch. Despite these extensive metabolic changes, however, the yield in the production of these natural substances is typically very low. <br>Genome-scale metabolic models are comprehensive mathematical networks of reactions and metabolites occurring within an organism. The generation of such a model requires extensive amounts of background information. Comprehensive scientific databases, such as StreptomeDB presented in this work, are a valuable tool for the creation of these models. Simulations based on such models can grant profound insights of the interrelationships of complex metabolic changes and the underlying regulatory context. This knowledge can in turn be used to efficiently develop rational metabolic engineering strategies.<br>In the course of this work, we used a genome-scale metabolic model of Streptomyces calvus to interpret the effect of the pleiotropic regulator bldA, a key player in the metabolic switch of this strain. For that, we gathered proteomic and transcriptomic data of the naturally bldA deficient wildtype strain and a mutant with restored bldA function. With the help of the genome-scale metabolic model, we could organize the data in a functional context and predict their regulatory effect on the metabolic machinery. The herein gained insights on the natural regulation of metabolic flux between primary and secondary metabolism were used to develop new methods for the generation of metabolic engineering strategies. Contrary to common methods, the aim of this approach is not to directly increase the secondary metabolite production rate, but to improve the ratio of produced secondary metabolite per produced biomass by decreasing the efficiency of the competing primary metabolism. This strategy was used with a genome-scale metabolic model of the already genome minimized host strain Streptomyces avermitilis SUKA22 to identify knockout candidates that have the potential to redirect the flux of metabolites and energy in favor of the production of Griseorhodin A, a promising telomerase and viral reverse transcriptase inhibitor. First semi quantitative experiments indicate, that g ...",

            "abstract": "In addition to the reinforcing compound nicotine, cigarette smoke contains a vast amount of hazardous chemicals, many of them known carcinogens. In combination with high smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking poses a huge yet avoidable health risk. Although smoking cessation is the most effective way to reduce smoking-associated harm, tobacco dependence is difficult to overcome. Alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS) release nicotine using different mechanisms than tobacco cigarettes, supposedly associated with a lower exposure to hazardous pyrolysis products. E-cigarettes use electrically generated heat to aerosolize a mixture of humectants and other ingredients to bring nicotine into an inhalable form. Similarly, heated tobacco products (HTPs) apply heat to aerosolize nicotine from tobacco. Both product groups are heterogeneous; HTPs employ different heating mechanisms and the design of e-cigarettes undergoes a constant change in generations. In recent years, e-cigarettes became simpler in use. Application of nicotine salts enabled the delivery of high nicotine concentrations (up to almost 60 mg/mL) that has led to a rise in adolescent users of e-cigarettes in the US and consequently to serious public health concerns. In Europe, the nicotine content in liquids of e-cigarettes is limited to a maximum of 20 mg/mL by the Tobacco Product Directive (TPD). Consequently, when such new or modified products enter the market, there is initially little knowledge regarding their potential addictiveness and harm. Science-based risk assessment of these products requires data on the delivery of nicotine and hazardous compounds to the consumer. While plenty of standardized methods already exist for the analysis of cigarette smoke, chemical characterization of novel products requires their adaption or development of new methods. Thus, nicotine and the main contributors to carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbonyl compounds, were determined in mainstream emissions of two different ...",

                "In this thesis we investigate harmonic analysis on a particular class of sub-Riemannian manifold, namely the 2-step stratified Lie groups $\\mathbb{G}$, as well as its applications in partial differential equations. This class consists a breadth of interesting geometric objects such as Heisenberg group and H-type Lie group, which can be seen as a meaningful extension of classical theories.After reviewing some main definitions and properties in Chapter 2, we start to study the most important representation of $\\mathbb{G}$, the so-called Schr\\\"{o}dinger representation on $L^2(\\mathbb{G})$, and then we prove the Stone-von Neumann theorem for the 2-step stratified Lie groups. In Chapter 3 we also study the Fourier transforms and define the $(\\lambda,\\nu)$-Wigner and $(\\lambda,\\nu)$-Weyl transform related to $\\mathbb{G}$, we then show some properties of these transforms, which can help us to compute the sub-Laplacian and the $\\lambda$-twisted sub-Laplacian. Moreover, in this chapter we demonstrate the beautiful interplay between the representation theory on $\\mathbb{G}$ and the classical expansions in terms of Hermite functions and Lagueere functions, As applications, a global calculus of pseudo-differential operator on 2-step stratified Lie groups $\\mathbb{G}$ is introduced in the fourth chapter. It relies on the explicit knowledge of the irreducible unitary representations of $\\mathbb{G}$, which then allows one to reduce the analysis to study of a rescaled harmonic oscillator on unitary dual $\\hat{\\mathbb{G}}$. The sub-Laplacian appears as an elliptic operator in this calculus. The explicit formula for the heat kernel of the $\\lambda$-twisted sub-Laplacian can be also obtained, which gives a closed formula for the heat kernel of the sub-Laplacian on $\\mathbb{G}$.$yLinzenz",

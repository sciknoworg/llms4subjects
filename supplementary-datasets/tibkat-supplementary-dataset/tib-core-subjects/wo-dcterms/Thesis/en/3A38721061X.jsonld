            "abstract": "Zeolite, TS-1, Ti-Beta, catalytic, oxidation, HIV-1, methylbenzene, ethylbenzene, cyclopentene,1-methylnaphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene. - Zeolites are crystalline microporous (alumino)-tectosilicates with a framework consisting of SiO4- and AlO4- tetrahedra, connected via the oxygen atoms at the corner points of the tetrahedron. The incorporation of metal atoms, other than aluminum in the framework of zeolites is also possible. This divided the zeolites in two groups: ion-exchanged zeolites and framework substituted zeolites. Framework substituted zeolites have different catalytic properties. The catalytic properties of zeolites, in which the Si in the framework is partly substituted by a metal ion like titanium, possess high potential in oxidation reactions or in Lewis acid catalyzed reactions. The first synthesis of silicalite TS-1 was achieved on 1983, and its unique catalytic activity in oxidation reactions with hydrogen peroxide, led to fast progress of investigation on heterogeneous catalytic oxidation and reveal a new possibility for ...",

            "title": "Amphibious magnetotellurics at the South-Central Chilean continental margin",
            "abstract": "In the austral summer of 2004-2005, the South-Central Chilean continental margin became the subject of an amphibious magnetotelluric experiment to image the conductivity distribution of the subduction zone, performed within the multidisciplinary TIPTEQ project (from The Incoming Plate to mega-Thrust EarthQuake processes). The enhanced conductivity is diagnostic of the presence of fluids, i.e water or partial melts. Magnetotellurics enables to assess qualitatively and quantitatively fluid volumes in the Earth's interior, and thus applies as an appropriate approach for investigating subductions zones, in which fluids play a key role, as a trigger and a controlling factor of rupture evolution, and earthquake nucleation, as well as partial melting reactions and volcanic activity. The magnetotelluric data were collected at several on- and offshore sites predominantly aligned along a transect, running over 400km across the main geological and morphotectonic units. It extended from the backarc up to the Pacific coast on the land side, and beyond the trench on the sea side, and complemented previous measurements from 2000 in this area in South Chile. A complete image of the conductivity distribution associated with dehydration and melting processes can only be provided if the data are acquired on both the sea and land side of the trench. This is because the fluids in the continental plate are electrically coupled with the ocean through the subduction zone via connecting pathways which can only be resolved by measurements in the sea...",

            "abstract": "Mth212, an exonuclease III homolog from the archaeon Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus, compensates the lack of a DNA uracil glycosylase (UDG) in this organism by catalyzing direct strand incision next to a uridine residue in the DNA, a reaction substituting in a single step the consecutive action of a UDG and an apurinic-/apyrimidinic (AP)-endonuclease in base excision repair (BER). Until present, Mth212 is the only exonuclease III homolog for which this additional activity has been demonstrated and the structural requirements thereof are still unknown. In order to address this question, the conversion of ExoA, exonuclease III homolog without DNA-uridine endonuclease activity from B. subtilis, into an Mth212-like enzyme by means of directed evolution and by directed mutagenesis was attempted. In directed evolution mutant exoA libraries were generated and the approaches to select ExoA with acquired DNA uridine endonuclease activity from the library were designed. In total, three selection approaches based on either B. subtilis or E. coli genetics were designed and tested. In the first selection approach lytic mutant of bacteriophage PBS1 from B. subtilis was to be utilized. DNA of this bacteriophage contains naturally uracils instead of thymines and this feature was to be used to select cells resistant to bacteriophage infection. Availabiliy of the lytic mutant of PBS1 was the main prerequisite to this approach; however, attempts to obtain this mutant were not successful ...",

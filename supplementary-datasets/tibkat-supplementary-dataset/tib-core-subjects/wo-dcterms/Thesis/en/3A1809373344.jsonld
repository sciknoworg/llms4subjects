            "abstract": "Spectroscopic methods were established decades ago in a wide variety of fields. This also applies to the pharmaceutical field, although they initially were mostly used for identity testing or structure elucidation only. Technical developments, such as miniaturization (NMR benchtop devices), Fourier transformations (for NMR, MIR spectroscopy) or the combination with chemometric evaluation (e.g., in Process Analytical Technology, PAT), have further increased their importance and opened up new applications. The aim of this work was to investigate further new approaches and to find new applications for already established methods and to show their benefits. By means of MIR, NIR and NMR data and their chemometric evaluation (principal component analysis, PCA; hierarchical cluster analysis, HCA; linear discriminant analysis, LDA), possibilities were presented to successfully determine the manufacturer or the pharmaceutical company of various paracetamol preparations. In the course of this, various similarities and correlations between the preparations of individual companies could also be identified. For this purpose, a suitable sample preparation was developed for each spectroscopic method, and suitable measurement parameters in order to obtain reproducible spectra for the chemometric evaluation were determined. Furthermore, the results of the two unsupervised methods (HCA, PCA) were compared with each other. The HCA was able to confirm those of the PCA for the very most part. Additionally, through these methods it was possible to characterize many of the preparations based on clusters formed by comparable tablet compositions. In order to be able to measure unmortared, whole tablets using the NIR spectrometer, an attachment was developed and manufactured using 3D printing. Its functionality was demonstrated by measuring and analyzing the tablets of two different batches of nine paracetamol preparations. The batches were clearly distinguished on the basis of a PCA and a significant difference was also demonstrated by ...",

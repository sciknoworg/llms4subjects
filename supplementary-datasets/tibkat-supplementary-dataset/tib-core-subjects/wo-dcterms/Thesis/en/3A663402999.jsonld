            "abstract": "The aims of this study were to determine expression pattern and subcellular localization of VSIG1, a novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and to analyse the function of the Vsig1 gene. Using PCR select cDNA subtraction method, we have isolated a cDNA fragment (Vsig1) which is predominantly expressed in stomach. In order to study the expression of VSIG1 at the protein level and determine the subcellular localization , we have generated polyclonal anti-VSIG1 antibody. Northern and Western blot analysis shows that Vsig1 gene is expressed specifically in stomach and testis. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that VSIG1 is localized on plasma membrane of glandular epithelial cells of stomach and the staining was most intense in the basolateral membrane of the pit cells. Vsigl mRNA and protein were not found in squamous epithelial cells of forestomach. The analysis of Vsig1 expression pattern during the pre- and postnatal developmental stages showed that Vsig1 is expressed initially in E13.5 stomach. The Vsig1-/Y?Vsig1+/Y chimeric mice generated by injection of Vsig1-null cells into the blastocyst had low chimerism and did not transmit the targeted allele to their offspring. Immunohistochemical analysis of the stomachs from two adult chimeric mice revealed that the corpus region of stomach contains Vsig1-deficient epithelial cells. This Vsig1-deficient epithelium was morphologically similar to squamous epithelium and expressed Cytokeratin-5/6 which is the marker of squamous epithelium. To overcome the embryonic lethality of chimeric mice due to high level of Vsig1-/Y ES cell contribution, we generated a Vsig1flox/Y?Vsig1+/Y chimeric mice for conditional knockout studies. Nevertheless, all chimeric mice had low chimerism and most of them (75%) were infertile. Analysis of sperm parameters revealed that the infertile chimeras had reduced number of spermatozoa in cauda epididymis and impaired sperm motility ...",

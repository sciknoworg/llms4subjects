            "abstract": "During the last decades, drilling evidence from marine gas hydrate investigations at convergent margins has revealed how complex gas hydrate accumulations can be at these margins. So far, the complexity of marine gas hydrate systems in these tectonically active environments has not been accurately represented by numerical models often used to predict gas hydrate formation and accumulation. The occurrence and distribution of marine gas hydrates at these margins, thus, have been poorly constrained. It is still un- known if regional processes that have influenced the evolution of these margins, such as vertical tectonics and subduction erosion, are useful factors that can add new ideas to improve these constraints. This dis- sertation has been focused to address this idea and to test the Tectonic BSR Hypothesis that links marine gas hydrates and vertical tectonics. In this dissertation, I aim to investigate the relation of marine gas hydrate systems situated along two forearc sedimentary basins of the central Peruvian convergent margin that have different vertical tectonic histories. The Trujillo Basin (at 9\u00b0S) and the Lima Basin (at 12\u00b0S) are two marine basins separated by \u223c300 km along the central Peru Margin which have been affected by distinct post-Late Miocene vertical tectonic histories due to the subduction of Nazca Ridge. The structural framework of Trujillo Basin has evolved under a post-Miocene low-to-moderate vertical tectonic regime and slow subduction erosion, whereas the structural framework of Lima Basin has been controlled by a moderate-to-strong vertical tectonics regime and fast subduction erosion as a consequence of the subduction of Nazca Ridge. In Chapter 2, I quantified subduction erosion in the Trujillo Basin. The aim of this quantification is to compare the tectonic evolution of this basin with the tectonic history of Lima Basin previously quantified. The main outcome from this study is that subduction erosion has varied in space and time and has dom- inated the structural evolution of this part of the Peruvian convergent margin during the last 60 million of years (Myr). ...",

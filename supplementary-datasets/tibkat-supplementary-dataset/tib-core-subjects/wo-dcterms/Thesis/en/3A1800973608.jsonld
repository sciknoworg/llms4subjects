            "title": "We need to talk\u2026 - Acceptance of Digital Voice Assistants among Millennials and older people",
            "abstract": "When Alan Turing formulated the Turing test in 1950, he certainly would not have thought that 70 years later, new trends and technology would change the way we experience our everyday life. Digital Voice Assistants are rapidly conquering the market and offering consumers simple, voice-based usability. Companies from various industries, such as the retail or the health sector, have recognized their potential and are already offering services digitally with the support of Digital Voice Assistants. It is only a matter of time that voice assistant will soon, at least to a certain extent, find their way into consumers' everyday lives. Against this background, the present thesis offers a good basis for better assessing the acceptance of Digital Voice Assistants and dealing more precisely with the influencing factors among the age cohorts - Millennials and older people. Three surveys of Millennials and one of older people were nearly examined under investigation of carefully selected technology acceptance models \u2013 the modified TAM and the modified UTAUT2. Those two models have proven to be reliable theories for testing the acceptance of new media. When analyzing the predictors among Millennials, Pastime is the most important aspect that influences the acceptance of Digital Voice Assistants. Moreover, Enjoyment, Image, Expediency, and Social Influence also positively impact the intention to use the system. Nonetheless, privacy concerns and the fear of being intercepted negatively affect Millennials' acceptance and the use of such new technologies. Within the second investigated group \u2013 older people, Performance Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions and Hedonic Motivation have the strongest influence on the acceptance of Digital Voice Assistants. Although, it should be noted that there are noticeable differences between individuals aged 55 to 64 years and those beyond the age of 65 years. The qualitative analysis shows that Digital Voice Assistants are very helpful while quickly looking for short information, navigating a car, traveling, or using a mobile phone, especially when manual input is impossible. People in both target groups mainly use their Digital Voice Assistants for time-saving and increase their image among friends and family, who strongly influence their decisions and behavior. Many users, especially those older ones, turn to Digital Voice Assistants when they feel lonely and need a conversation with somebody. Future studies should examine further age cohorts in different countries. A specific subdivision of older people will also be recommended. Another interesting aspect, which will certainly provide meaningful findings, is to examine differences between Behavioral Intention to Use and different education levels.",

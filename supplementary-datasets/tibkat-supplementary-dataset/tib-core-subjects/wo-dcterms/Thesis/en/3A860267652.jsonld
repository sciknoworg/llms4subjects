            "abstract": "Theories pertaining to spatial planning and sustainable development have magnificently grown during the second half of the past century and still witness increased rate of attention concerning the manifold aspects encapsulated by their subjects. However, both of these themes still remain underestimated and require further investigation and even augmentation when exploring areas of \u2018political turbulences\u2019 or \u2018unbalanced powers\u2019; in other words, regions of \u2018conflict areas\u2019. The development process in the conflict areas seems to depend ultimately on the scale and magnitude of power between the different contested groups, i.e. the \u2018dominant group\u2019 and the \u2018weaker group\u2019; where sustainability becomes very vulnerable, and if exists, belongs to the dominant group neglecting the weaker one, and even in many cases, exploiting the resources and opportunities of the weaker for the advantage of the dominant, resulting therefore, more marginalizing and social degradation. Hence, new arguments pertaining to sustainability in the conflict areas conclude that sustainable development in these areas can be considered as a \u2018terminology game\u2019 which does not resolve the older growth debate, but disguises it. Spatial planning in the conflict areas may shape fast-changing or dynamic spatial policies accompanied with irreversible physical layouts that create in many cases multi-dimensional challenges for inhabitants. Especially, for the indigenous residents when considered for one reason or another \u2018a group of minority\u2019. Therefore, clarifying the relationship between spatial planning, power and politics is a prominent issue in this doctoral research. Understanding this relation reveals the range of influence of politics upon planning objectives and role. Accordingly, it is a marvelous question to know if planning is an organic reflection of politics or not; as well as, to explore whether spatial planning, in the conflict areas, is used to mitigate or intensify conflict. Based upon theoretical framework, this doctoral research presents comprehensive set of interrelationships between the main parameters affecting the development process in the conflict areas, namely (space, politics, power and planning); these are interestingly elaborated and conceptualized by the researcher within referenced spatial context; i.e. Jerusalem (the case study). Moreover, the direct and implicit role and impacts of these relations were examined. The examination through logical framework (theory \u2013 analysis \u2013 conception) of the aforementioned parameters (in conflict areas) reveals a maze of dynamic interrelationships which outstandingly guide the development for the benefit of the dominant group. This doctorate research provides critical review for the role of planning whether it acts as \u2018progressive\u2019 or \u2018regressive\u2019 agent of change, especially in the conflict areas with unbalanced powers. In Jerusalem, it has been shown that power and politics are the major planning drivers which set out the development pattern and objectives. Consequently, the spatial and social profiles of Jerusalem have been changing very fast producing new norms of urban fabrics and geographical extents, which all together, constitute manifold challenges to the \u2018indigenous\u2019 Palestinian residents.",

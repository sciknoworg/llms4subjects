            "abstract": "Different properties of meltable magnetic bionanocomposites based on dextran fatty acid ester were systematically studied in this work, namely the heating behavior under alternating magnetic field, release behavior of loaded model drug, and the surface hydrophilic/hydrophobic property after applying alternating magnetic field. The mobility of magnetic particles was investigated with static gradient magnetic field. Different to ferrofluid and magnetic hydrogel system, in this thermoplastic composite system the magnetic particles could only move slowly in the matrix due to high viscosity of polymer melts. The slow relaxation behavior of magnetic particles was observed at 120 \u00b0C with 0.05Hz in AC susceptometry. The heating behavior of meltable nanobiocomposites with high frequency alternating magnetic field was studied and an optimal condition (> 1% magnetic particle content and > 1 mm thickness) for preparing NBC samples was worked out. In the molten state of the matrix a \u201cmagnetic texturing\u201d of particles can be built by means of a static external magnetic field which could strengthen the heating ability of the composite material at certain spot. Furthermore, meltable polysaccharide-based biopolymers can be applied to design magnetically remote controlled drug release system. An advantage of this NBC compared with hydrogel is that compounds of rather high molar mass\uff0ci.e. GFP, can be immobilized inside without leaking when no external thermal stimulus is applied. Increasing of temperature by AMF has accelerated diffusion of model drugs (GFP and RhB) compared with samples without heat treatment. The increased amount of released model drug is close to each other for AMF and external heating methods. After 60 days 16 wt.% of RhB is released by applying AMF. The immobilization of drug and their controlled release in vivo by applying magnetic field of this meltable and bio-based magnetic composite still need further investigation. This work is the first study on the heating ability and release behavior of this magnetic composite. Applying magnetic field generated (2\u00b0) decrease of contact angle on the dextran myristate composites layers. Applying the same magnetic field on dextran palmitate samples has no effect on the contact angle. Furthermore, increasing concentration of MNP from 1% to 5% (dextran palmitate samples) brings no change on the contact angle. The surface of composite layers embedded with hydrophilic magnetic particles (no oleic acid coating) keep their hydrophobic behavior of the matrix. No topographic change on the surface was revealed by SEM and AFM for all samples, though chain-like formation of magnetic particle was observed. With up to 5% MNP the surface morphology is not able to be modified to realize a change in contact angle. The cellular attachment and growth behavior of endothelial cell line HBMEC (human brain microvascular endothelial cell) on the surface of NBC was not changed after applying magnetic field. The reason could be that the energy given by magnetic field is not enough to generate a topographic change on the surface, compared to other methods, such as light and mechanical methods.",

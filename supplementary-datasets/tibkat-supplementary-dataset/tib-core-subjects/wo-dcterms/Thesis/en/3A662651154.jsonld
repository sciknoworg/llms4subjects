            "abstract": "Transfer of information between individual neurons via exocytosis is mediated by fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane and requires assembly of the SNARE proteins Syntaxin-1, SNAP-25 and Synaptobrevin 2 into a complex. Although the SNARE complex has been thoroughly studied in-vitro and many of its features including its structure have been characterized, little is known about the molecular mode of action in vivo. Above all, it remains to be established how action of the SNAREs mechanistically is involved in the steps necessary for synaptic vesicles to gain fusion competence (docking, priming) and how formation of the SNARE complex is involved in the final steps of fusion. The present studies investigated the role of the SNARE proteins and their binding partners in docking, priming and fusion of secretory vesicles. As a model system, the mouse chromaffin cell enables the analysis of the role of individual proteins at the different stages of the release cycle in the clean genetic background of knockout mice. A number of different methodological approaches, ranging from electron microscopy to electrophysiological characterization, or mere biophysical techniques were utilized in order to generate a model of vesicle maturation and the molecular players involved therein ...",

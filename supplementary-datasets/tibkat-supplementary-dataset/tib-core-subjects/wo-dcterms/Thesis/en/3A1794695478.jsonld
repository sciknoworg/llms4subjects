                "Quality Circles - Learning processes of participants and the potential for strengthening the work in self-help groups.Study to investigate members' learning processes from self-help groups through participation in a joint quality circle with particular focus on whether the structure of a quality circle can be applied to the work in self-help groups. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with participants following a year and a half of moderated quality circle work. The analysis was carried out with a qualitative design. Being affected or \"sick\" connects, and the participants found parallels on many levels (partnership, family, profession) completely independent of their respective illnesses. The quality circle work taught the participants to actively and responsibly shape changes in their lives, get to know themselves regarding their illness, discover and further develop their resources. This kind of learning can result in concrete implementations for coping with problems in the social and professional environment and the work within the self-help group. The prerequisite for success is that the participants are willing to work on problems together. Furthermore, the way of facilitating the discussions proved to be significant for enriching QC work. The quality circle method's transferabilityto work in a self-help group is quite conceivable but needs support for the structural implementation.$yLinzenz",

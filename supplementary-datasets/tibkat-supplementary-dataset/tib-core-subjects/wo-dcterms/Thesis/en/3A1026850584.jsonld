            "abstract": "Abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a set of diseases that are characterized by aberrant clonal proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Molecular pathophysiology of MPN is poorly understood. Previous results in Prof. Pahl's lab underscore the role of Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2 (NF-E2) in MPN. Elevated NF-E2 was observed in MPN patients. A transgenic mouse model overexpressing NF-E2 was characterized in our lab. This mouse model displayed MPN phenotype and subsequently developed AML. Furthermore, several mutations in NF-E2 were also identified in MPN patients. These mutants  showed a gain of function in mouse erythroleukemia cell line and bone marrow transplanted mouse model. To rule out biasness of overexpression, the aim of this thesis work was to generate novel murine models harboring NF-E2 mutation at a physiological level and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying role of these mutations in pathophysiology of MPN. This work also includes functional characterization of recently identified novel NF-E2 mutations in MPN patients. The question how these mutants may enhance wt function was also addressed. Additionally, preclinical analysis of a novel drug for MPN was tested to explore the therapeutic potential. The results presented in this thesis show that a small deletion in the leucine zipper domain of NF-E2 (\u0394297-300) plays a prominent role in MPN. The knock in mice harboring \u0394297-300 NF-E2 displays splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, aberrant myeloid to lymphoid ratio and delayed erythroid maturation. The thrombocytopenia observed in knock in mice recapitulates the low platelet counts of PMF patient with \u0394297-300 NF-E2. Interestingly, these mice also show features of histiocytic sarcoma, a phenotype often associated with PMF and AML. However, the knock in mice harboring point mutation near the sumoylation site of NF-E2 (R365P) is insufficient to predispose to MPN. It may require other cooperating mutation to cause MPN. Recently, NF-E2 truncating mutation (226aa) possessing only N-terminal has been identified in several MPN patients. Therefore, a novel conditional knock in mouse model is generated, characterization of which is anxiously awaited. In this work, several other novel NF-E2 mutations were functionally classified into four classes based on DNA binding activity, transactivation potential and subcellular localization. These include 1) activating point mutations - that show higher activity than wt, 2) Loss of function-point mutation-I ...",

Microorganisms in the world oceans are extremely abundant, their abundance is estimated to be 1029. They have a central role in the recycling of organic matter, therefore they influence the air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide, carbon flux through the food web, and carbon sedimentation by sinking of dead material. Bacteroidetes is one of the most abundant bacterial phyla in marine systems and its members are hypothesized to play a pivotal role in the recycling of organic matter. However, most of the evidence about their role is derived from cultivated species. Bacteroidetes is a highly diverse phylum and cultured strains represent the minority of the marine bacteroidetal community, hence, our knowledge about their ecological role is largely incomplete. In this thesis Bacteroidetes in open ocean and in coastal seas were investigated by a suite of molecular methods. The diversity and clade-specific abundance of Bacteroidetes were analyzed in different oceanic provinces in the North Atlantic Ocean. Comparative sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene libraries revealed a high diversity and significant spatial variability. Major bacteroidetal clades were delimited based on 16S rRNA gene sequence identities and further quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Preliminary FISH analysis indicated that certain Bacteroidetes clades were present in numbers lower than the detection limit of the method. Therefore, the FISH quantification protocol was modified by increasing the sample volume, which allowed us to reliably quantify populations down to absolute numbers of only 500 cells ml-1. All bacteroidetal clades evaluated showed pronounced regional distribution patterns. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that the bacteroidetal community composition largely reflects the satellite space-based demarcation of ocean provinces. Large ...",

            "abstract": "Soil is the most complex microbial habitat on Earth with respect to bacterial species diversity and community size. Therefore, assessing the bacterial community composition in soil is a considerable challenge. Furthermore, soil-born micro-organisms harbor a largely untapped biotechnological potential. The present thesis focused on the metagenomic analysis of soil samples from the three German Biodiversity Exploratories, the Hainich region, the Schw\u00e4bische Alb, and the Schorfheide. Whole metagenomic DNA was isolated for the subsequent analyses. Phylogenetic analysis of microbial soil community compositions was performed using grassland samples from the Hainich (topsoil and subsoil) and grassland and forest samples from the Schw\u00e4bische Alb. The partial 16S rRNA gene was amplified prior to pyrosequencing, which yielded a total of 1.35 million high quality sequences. The relative abundances of several taxonomic groups, such as Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes changed significantly between topsoil and subsoil grassland samples and between topsoil samples from forest and grassland. A higher bacterial diversity was determined in topsoil than in subsoil on phylum and species level. Furthermore, a higher bacterial diversity was detected in grassland soil than in forest soil on the phylum level. Within the forest samples the tree species affected the soil bacterial community composition",

            "abstract": "To investigate the role of PCGF6 and E2F6 in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and at the beginning of differentiation, knockout cell lines of both proteins and in combination were generated by the CRISPR/Cas9n system. Characterization of these knockout cell lines (KO) was performed by growth analysis in mESCs and differentiating murine stem cells (EBs). It was found that Pcgf6 KO cells formed smaller EBs that also could not be maintained in culture for an extended period. To resolve this specific phenotype, further molecular analyses were performed by flow cytometry (FACS). Cells of the Pcgf6 KO exhibited an increased proportion of cells in G1 phase during differentiation as well as an increased apoptotic frequency. Supporting the assumption of a cell cycle defect, RNASeq data were analysed. It could be shown that cells of the Pcgf6 KO differentiated in a temporally uncontrolled manner. Evaluation of differentially expressed genes revealed that expression of E2f6, a regulator of the cell cycle and another component of the non-canonical PRC1.6, was downregulated in mESC and EB cultures, whereas cell cycle-specific targets of E2F6-dependent gene regulation were upregulated at day 2 of differentiation. These results indicated that deletion of Pcgf6 at the beginning of differentiation must have effects on E2F6-dependent cell cycle regulation. Due to mycoplasma contamination in the cell culture at this time point, the Pcgf6 KO cell line had to be re-established. In addition, KO cell lines of E2f6 in Wt and in Pcgf6 KO mESCs were established. The replication of cellular characterization of the phenotype revealed that EB cultures of the Pcgf6 KO and the double knockout of Pcgf6 and E2f6 (dKOPcgf6/E2f6) exhibited reduced cell numbers during differentiation. Molecular characterizations of the phenotype revealed that the increased proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the Pcgf6 KO, which was detected before mycoplasma contamination, could not be reproduced. However, an increased frequency of cells in the G2 phase of ...",

            "abstract": "We are yet to learn precisely how we learn. The molecular and physiological mechanisms that govern the process of cognition remain a mystery to scientific minds around the globe. This also greatly limits our capability to encounter cognitive diseases efficaciously. With an ageing world population, it is crucial to understand and develop effective therapeutic strategies against age-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD). Previous research has shown that the process of memory formation involves the regulation of gene expression in the brain. Apart from genes, key proteins are also known to be differentially regulated by post-translational modifications during the acquisition and consolidation of new memories. One such mechanism is the acetylation and deacetylation of histones. Histone modifications serve as crucial players in the process of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The acetylation of histones is specific in nature and can also be modulated by environmental stimuli. This concept is called the histone code\u02ba. Histone acetylation is balanced by the action of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) and has been shown to be beneficial for memory consolidation. This study shows that elevation of histone acetylation by HDAC inhibition is beneficial for cognition in a mouse model for AD. This involves the upregulation of genes associated with the process of memory formation. However, HDAC inhibition did not exert any effect on \u00df-amyloid pathology exhibited by this mouse model. This shows that cognitive improvement in AD could be independent of ongoing pathology and HDAC inhibition could serve to significantly facilitate cognitive recovery in AD ...",

            "abstract": "Various mitochondrial inner membrane proteins contribute to the structure of cristae membranes and to the overall dynamic morphology of the inner membrane. These proteins include the F1FOATPase dimers, which contribute to the curvature and angular shape of cristae. Also, Fcj1/Mitofilin are involved in cristae junction formation and act in an antagonistic manner in inner membrane curvature with respect to F1FOATPase dimers. Whereas several small proteins mediate F1FOATPase dimerization in yeast by binding sequentially at monomer interfaces, the exact nature of what promotes F1FOATPase dimerization in higher eukaryotes is yet to be determined. To this end, the initial aim of this study was to identify novel F1FOATPase dimerization factors in higher eukaryotes that parallel the action of small dimerization factors in yeast. An in silico approach to identify novel F1FOATPase dimerization factors resulted in the identification of the human mitochondrial protein MINOS1 as a potential candidate. MINOS1, along with its human homolog, Mio10, were investigated. These proteins however were found not to be stably associated with the F1FOATPase. Moreover, Mio10 did not affect F1FOATPase dimerization, oligomerization, or enzymatic activity. Thus a role of Mio10 and MINOS in dimerization was excluded. Instead by using an affinity purification based mass spectrometric analysis, Mio10/MINOS1 were identified as novel interaction partners of Fcj1/Mitofilin. Topological analysis of Mio10 and MINOS together with results of size exclusion chromatography indicated that the two proteins form large mitochondrial inner membrane complexes ...",

There is an interesting background story that led to it. The devastating floods of the year 2000 in the Mekong area brought about a number of international activities, in the course of which I was invited by the German Foreign Office to participate in the formative meeting of the Mekong River Commission\u015b flood management and mitigation program. My experience with this kind of activities included participation in an expert meeting in Mozambique after the big Limpopo flood of 1998, where a mixed group of experts had gathered to make recommendations for future flood control.

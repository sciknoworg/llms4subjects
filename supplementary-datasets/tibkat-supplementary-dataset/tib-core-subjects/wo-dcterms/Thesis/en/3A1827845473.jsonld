            "abstract": "The main subjects of analysis in the present book are the stages of initiation in the grand scheme of Theosophical evolution. These initiatory steps are connected to an idea of evolutionary self-development by means of a set of virtues that are relative to the individual\u2019s position on the path of evolution. The central thesis is that these stages were translated from the \u201cHindu\u201d tradition to the \u201cTheosophical\u201d tradition through multifaceted \u201chybridization processes\u201d in which several Indian members of the Theosophical Society partook. Starting with Annie Besant\u2019s early Theosophy, the stages of initiation are traced through Blavatsky\u2019s work to Manilal Dvivedi and T. Subba Row, both Indian members of the Theosophical Society, and then on to the San\u00e2tana Dharma Text Books. In 1898, the English Theosophist Annie Besant and the Indian Theosophist Bhagavan Das together founded the Central Hindu College, Benares, which became the nucleus around which the Benares Hindu University was instituted in 1915. In this context the San\u00e2tana Dharma Text Books were published. M\u00fchlematter shows that the stages of initiation were the blueprint for Annie Besant\u2019s pedagogy, which she implemented in the Central Hindu College in Benares. In doing so, he succeeds in making intelligible how \u201cesoteric\u201d knowledge was transferred to public institutions and how a broader public could be reached as a result. The dissertation has been awarded the ESSWE PhD Thesis prize 2022 by the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism",

            "abstract": "This thesis consists of three independent contributions in the area of microeconomic theory. All three contributions share the feature of agents holding multidimensional private information which motivates the title of the thesis. Part 1, entitled \u201cConsistency and Communication in Committees\u201d, is based on a working paper under the same title which is joint work with Inga Deimen and Mark T. Le Quement, both from the University of Bonn. In this paper, we generalize the classical binary Condorcet jury model by introducing a richer state and signal space, thereby generating a concern for consistency in the evaluation of aggregate information. Information is of multidimensional nature here as it does not only provide information about the defendant being guilty or innocent but also indicates a particular modality of guilt or innocence. As coherent evidence for a particular variant of either guilt or innocence is more meaningful than if that information were dispersed, the consistency of signals constitutes a second informative dimension besides the mere number of signals indicating guilt or innocence when deciding whether to acquit or convict the defendant. We use this approach to analyze truthtelling incentives in pre-vote communication in heterogeneous committees and find that full pooling of information followed by sincere voting is compatible with a positive probability of ex post conflict in the committee. This is in stark contrast to the benchmark finding for the binary signal model in Coughlan (2000). We furthermore characterize implementability conditions for a wide class of decision rules including the rule that maximizes committee welfare...",

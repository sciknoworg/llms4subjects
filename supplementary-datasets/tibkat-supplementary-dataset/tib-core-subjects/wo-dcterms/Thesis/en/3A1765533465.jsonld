            "title": "The role of DUX4 in herpesviral infection",
            "abstract": "Herpesviruses are common human pathogens with a high worldwide prevalence. They cause a variety of diseases for example cold sore, chicken pox or mononucleosis. While infections in humans with a healthy immune system are usually mild, they can be life threatening for new-borns or immunocompromised people. Some of them, like the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus are classified as WHO class I carcinogens and induce cancer. Once infected, herpesviruses have a lifelong persistence in their host. Therefore, the risk of developing an active infection is always present. Currently, there is no therapy available to clear the virus out of the body. In consequence, understanding the mechanisms involved in herpesviral infection is crucial for the development of new therapies. DUX4 is a pioneering transcription factor and master regulator of zygotic genome activation in early embryogenesis. During zygotic genome activation, the newly formed zygotic genome is completely reorganised and thousands of genes are expressed. This essential process leads to totipotency and ensures developmental progression of the embryo. Following this phase in development, DUX4 gene expression is silenced in somatic adult tissues and limited to the testis. Aberrant expression of DUX4 in adult muscle cells causes of the complex genetic disorder Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD). The objective of this dissertations is to elucidate the role of the embryonal transcription factor DUX4 during herpesviral infection. My work discovers a novel and yet uncharacterized mechanism in herpesviral biology. Herpesviruses from \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-subfamilies activate the expression of DUX4 during infection, implicating that it is a common and conserved mechanism among human specific herpesviruses. The activation of DUX4 initiates the expression of a diverse and large transcriptional network resembling the DUX4-induced network during embryonal development. For this reason, I hypothesize that herpesviruses induce DUX4 expression to ...",

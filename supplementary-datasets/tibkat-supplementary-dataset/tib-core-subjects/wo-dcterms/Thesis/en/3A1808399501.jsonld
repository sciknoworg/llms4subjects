            "abstract": "Obesity and associated metabolic syndrome are growing concerns in modern society due to the negative consequences for human health and well-being. Cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes are only some of the pathologies associated to overweight. Among the main causes are decreased physical activity and food availability and composition. Diets with high content of fat are energy-dense and their overconsumption leads to an energy imbalance, which ultimately promotes energy storage as fat and obesity. Aberrant activation of signalling cascades and hormonal imbalances are characteristic of this disease and members of the Protein Kinase D (PKD) family have been found to be involved in several mechanisms mediating metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of Protein Kinase D2 (PKD2) in the regulation of metabolism. Our investigation initiated with a mice model for global PKD2 inactivation, which allowed us to prove a direct involvement of this kinase in lipids homeostasis and obesity. Inactivation of PKD2 protected the mice from high-fat diet-induced obesity and improved their response to glucose, insulin and lipids. Furthermore, the results indicated that, even though there were no changes in energy intake or expenditure, inactivation of PKD2 limited the absorption of fat from the intestine and promoted energy excretion in feces. These results were verified in a mice model for specific deletion of intestinal PKD2. These mice not only displayed an improved metabolic fitness but also a healthier gut microbiome profile. In addition, we made use of a small-molecule inhibitor of PKD in order to prove that local inhibition of PKD2 in the intestine was sufficient to inhibit lipid absorption. The usage of the inhibitor not only protected the mice from obesity but also was efficient in avoiding additional body-weight gain after obesity was pre-established in mice. Mechanistically, we determined that PKD2 regulates lipids uptake in enterocytes by phosphorylation of Apolipoprotein A4 (APOA4) and ...",

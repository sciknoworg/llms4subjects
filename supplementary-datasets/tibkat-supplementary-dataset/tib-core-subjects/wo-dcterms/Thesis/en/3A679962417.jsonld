            "abstract": "The human-induced loss of biodiversity from many ecosystems has led to increased interest in the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Research in this field is mostly focused on the producer level, i.e. the diversity of plants. Plant diversity can positively affect the diversity and abundance of higher trophic level organisms, for example insects. In addition, it has been shown that plant diversity can impact plant-insect interactions such as pollination and herbivory. Most studies on plant diversity effects have been conducted in grasslands, whereas forest ecosystems have received less attention so far. In particular, herbaceous plant communities of the forest understorey and their associated insect communities have rarely been the focus of biodiversity studies. In this thesis we investigated plant diversity effects in the herb layer of a near-natural temperate deciduous forest. We explored possible linkages between the plant diversity of the tree and the herb layer. In addition, we investigated how the diversity of tree and herb layer influence diversity, abundance and community composition of fly communities in the herb layer. Finally, we studied trophic interactions (herbivory, pollination-dependent seed production, seed predation) in relation to tree and herb diversity. The study was conducted on 100 plots along a gradient of tree diversity (29 species) and herb diversity (228 species) in the Hainich National Park (Central Germany) ...",

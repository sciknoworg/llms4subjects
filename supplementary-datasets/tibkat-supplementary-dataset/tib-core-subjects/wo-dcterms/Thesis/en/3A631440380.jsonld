            "abstract": "GammaRay Bursts (GRBs) represent the most explosive events in the Universe after the Big Bang. They are sudden, intense flashes of gammarays, which, for a few blinding seconds, become the brightest objects in the Universe. This reflects extreme conditions which are fascinating and worth exploring. During the last two decades, the understanding of GRBs has been revolutionized more by observational progress rather than by theoretical predictions. A first major advance in the comprehension of the GRB phenomenon occurred in 1991 with the launch of the Compton GammaRay Observatory (CGRO). The allsky survey from the Burst and Transient Experiment onboard CGRO measured about 3000 bursts and showed that they were isotropically distributed, thus suggesting a cosmological origin. A better understanding of the physics of GRBs has been made possible by precise localizations in the late &rsquo;90s, which discovered that the prompt emission in gammarays is followed by a longerlasting afterglow, which can be detected in all wavelengths ranges from radio, optical, to X and gammarays up to several days after the explosion ...",

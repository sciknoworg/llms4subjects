            "abstract": "Abstract: Deep learning has become the common practice for most computer vision tasks due to being state-of-the-art in both accuracy and runtime. It has not only revolutionized machine learning and computer vision, but also moved us a big step closer to artificial intelligence. Due to its success, besides academia, it has already been part of many industrial and clinical solutions; from autonomous driving to Instagram\u2019s cyberbullying detection, from Twitter\u2019s tweet curation to Heineken\u2019s data-driven marketing, from music generation to augmenting/replacing radiologists to detect cancer in Computed Tomography scans. While deployment of deep learning approaches is straight-forward as better ones are being developed, for safety-critical applications a big challenge remains: estimating uncertainty. In autonomous systems like self-driving cars, it is of great importance that the system knows when it does not know e.g. heavy rain obscures the vision,<br>the car was trained for highway but is now at Arc de Triomphe in Paris or a koala runs to the street due to a bush fire. Uncertainty estimation not only enables us to quantify the reliability of a decision coming from a system, but when modeled fully, also enables us to solve nondeterministic tasks with more than one possible outcome, such as future prediction: an important aspect of human intelligence. Once we have a reasonable estimation for the uncertainty of a subsystem, another challenge is to make good use of this new data modality by propagating it properly through chains of subsystems to improve the result of the whole system. <br>This thesis starts with a general presentation of the value of deep learning in medical image segmentation. <br>Then, it continues by equipping modern convolutional neural networks with uncertainty estimation in show-cases of optical flow and future localization. <br>Finally, it uses the uncertainty estimation to improve network predictions in tracking cell nuclei tagged with a dynamic protein and future captioning",

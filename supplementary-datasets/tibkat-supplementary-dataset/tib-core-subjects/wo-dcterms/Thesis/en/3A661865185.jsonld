            "abstract": "Deep sea, chemosynthesis, biogeography. - Deep-sea floors are diverse environments that range from permanently cold (desert-like plains) to hot systems (hydrothermal vents). In hot systems, primary productivity is performed by microbial communities which use chemical energy generated by geological processes (lithotrophy). This energy transfer from mantle to the ocean is as yet poorly understood, and the diversity and activity of microbes at these sites is therefore an interesting target for microbial ecologists. However, the vast majority of all globally distributed deep-sea sediments is permanently cold. The distribution of microorganisms in deep-sea floors and the factors controlling it at small and large scales are important for the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate biodiversity. During this thesis, hydrothermally influenced sediments of the peridotite-hosted Logatchev hydrothermal vent field were investigated in an interdisciplinary study to reveal the diversity and activity of the associated microbial communities. In situ microprofiles showed that these sediments were controlled by diffusive transport, instead of previously reported advective processes. White mats on top of these sediments resemble Beggiatoa-mats from the basalt- hosted field in the Guaymas Basin. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the overlying sulfur-mats were dominated by filamentous Epsilonproteobacteria or a vibrioid Arcobacter-type. The microbial community of the surface layer was predominantly composed of Epsilonproteobacteria (7-21%), Deltaproteobacteria (20-21%), and Bacteroidetes (19- 20%). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses identified various bacteria related to those found in basaltic systems. The presence of an active microbial community in these sediment surface layers was confirmed by high oxygen consumption rates. Geochemical analyses detected metal-sulfides in the sediments, elemental sulfur in the mats and an intensive sulfide flux from below. Ex situ incubations and turnover rate experiments revealed that sulfide is consumed and that sulfate-reduction is performed by the surface ...",

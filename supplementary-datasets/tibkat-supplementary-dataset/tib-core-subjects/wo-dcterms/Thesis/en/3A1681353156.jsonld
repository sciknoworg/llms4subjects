            "abstract": "Abstract: The measurement of the Higgs-boson coupling to tau-leptons, based on an integrated luminosity of 36.1 ifb recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector, is presented in this thesis. The analysis considers all combinations of leptonic and hadronic decays of tau-leptons, and targets the main two production modes of the Higgs boson, gluon Fusion and Vector-Boson Fusion. The inclusive cross section of the H->tautau decay channel is measured as 3.77 +1.06-0.95 (+0.60-0.59 (Stat.) +0.87-0.74 (Syst.)) pb, which corresponds to a deviation from the background-only hypothesis with an observed (expected) significance of 4.4 (4.1) standard deviations. In addition, the measurement of cross sections in the framework of Simplified Template Cross Sections is discussed. All measurement are in agreement with predictions of the Standard Model.<br>The combined measurement of Higgs-boson properties is also presented, based on up to 79.8 ifb of data recorded at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector. An observation of the four main production modes (ggF, VBF, VH and ttH+tH) and of four of the five main decay channels (H->gammagamma, H->ZZ, H->WW and H->bb) of the Higgs boson is achieved. In particular, the deviation from the background-only hypothesis with an observed (expected) significance of 6.5 (5.3) standard deviations for the VBF production mode is the first observation of this process by a single experiment. Measurements in the scope of the kappa-framework and of Simplified Template Cross Sections are also discussed. All the performed measurements are compatible with the Standard-Model expectations",

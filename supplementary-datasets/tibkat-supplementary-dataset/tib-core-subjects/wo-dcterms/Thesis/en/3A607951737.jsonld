            "abstract": "The present thesis deals with the time series analysis of atmospheric wind velocity recordings by taking into account that the recordings do not reflect ideal turbulence and with the modelling of the wind velocity by stochastic processes. As a consequence of the poor comprehension of atmospheric turbulence, time series analysis is an appropriate tool to study atmospheric wind. Based on fluctuation statistics and superstatistics, a variety of statistical tools which allow to analyse wind velocity recordings are developed and validated. It is verified that atmospheric boundary layer wind speed data represent in good approximation a succession of ideal turbulence periods with different parameters. The algorithms are able estimate the time evolution of the turbulence parameters. However, the results also indicate the existence of periods in which the wind velocity recording does not reflect turbulence. The focus is not only on the velocity increment but additionally on the wind speed variation around the mean wind speed (which itself is treated as a random variable). It is confirmed that the wind speed fluctuation is roughly normally distributed and that there is a proportionality between the standard deviation of the fluctuation and the mean wind speed...",

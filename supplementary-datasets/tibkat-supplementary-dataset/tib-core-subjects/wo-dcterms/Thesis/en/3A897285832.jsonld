            "title": "Sweet switches: Azobenzene glycosides as photosensitive lectin inhibitors in solution and on surfaces",
            "abstract": "Non-covalent interactions between carbohydrate ligands and their lectin receptors are accompanied by conformational changes between the interacting partners. Such changes might reflect a principal conformational control of carbohydrate-protein interactions, which has received only little attention until to date. Hence, the central focus of this thesis is to synthesize photoswitchable glycomimetics and investigate the role of light-induced conformational changes in carbohydrate recognition. Thus azobenzene glycoconjugates are principal target molecules of our research. Photoirradiation of azobenzene glycosides at ~ 365 nm induces E\u2192Z isomerization leading to a certain E/Z ratio in the photostationary state (PSS). The special features of azobenzene glycoconjugates featuring an E\u2192Z\u2192E isomerization option in solution will eventually allow us to utilise this type of molecules with \uf061-D-mannose-specific lectins. In this context, a new class of azobenzene glycosides were synthesized and their photochromic properties were studied in solution by 1H NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy and they were tested as inhibitors for type 1 fimbriae-mediated bacterial adhesion, such as the bacterial lectin FimH.. To mimic the cell surface glycocalyx, azobenzene glycosides were immobilised on gold surfaces to form photoswitchable glyco-SAMs. Photoisomerization was performed on the gold surface and monitored by IRRAS and UV-Vis spectroscopy. To get insight in the conformational control of carbohydrate recognition in a multivalence context, photosensitive glyconanopartices were also prepared and binding efficiency of different isomers was tested with the lectin ConA.",

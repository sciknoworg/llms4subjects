            "abstract": "Enhancers are a central component of transcriptional regulatory networks, yet many aspects about them are still not well understood. In this thesis, general enhancer research was conducted from two different perspectives. Firstly, the evolutionary mechanisms of redundant enhancers were investigated in a genome-wide approach. Enhancers can evolve from transposable elements, a process known as exaptation or co-option. If two or more enhancers of the same gene can independently induce its transcription in a given cell type, these enhancers are considered redundant. To address the research question whether or not transposon exaptation is a widespread means of redundant enhancer evolution, a set of redundant enhancers was constructed for the human genome and properties that distinguish redundant enhancers from non-redundant enhancers were identified. It was then shown that independent transposon exaptation events are a common origination mechanism of redundant enhancers. These observations could also be confirmed in the mouse genome. In addition, evidence was found that for homologous genes in human and mouse with redundant enhancers in both species the redundant enhancers exert important functions, but are not homologous. Secondly, putative key genes, enhancers and their potential regulatory transcription factors were identified in order to help elucidate pressing questions in two different biological contexts. The first context was chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its treatment. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is frequently treated with the kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, but drug resistance and off-target toxicity remain to be overcome. Therefore, existing therapies need to be improved and new ones developed. In this thesis, potential key enhancers and transcription factors were identified through genome-wide analysis of histone H3K27 acetylation by ChIP-seq to help understand the genomic and epigenetic reactions of the cells to ibrutinib. Treatment-induced changes were observed in putative enhancers and genes related to ...",

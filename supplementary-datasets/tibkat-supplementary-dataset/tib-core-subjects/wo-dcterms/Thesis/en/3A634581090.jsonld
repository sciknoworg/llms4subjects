            "abstract": "The subject of this thesis is online optimization, which deals with making decisions in an environment where the data describing the process to optimize becomes available over time, i. e., online. In particular, we study combinatorial online optimization problems involving discrete decisions both from a practical and a theoretical point of view. The first part of the thesis is devoted to reoptimization algorithms for the online control of complex real-world systems. A reoptimization algorithm obtains its online control decision by determining a decision that is in some sense good\u02ba for the current state of the system. We apply rigorous mathematical modelling and optimization methods based on Integer Progamming to develop advanced reoptimization algorithms. Our first application concerns the automatic dispatching of a large fleet of service vehicles to serve waiting customers. We find that rigorous methods improve the performance of the dispatching process, leading to shorter waiting times for the customers. In our second application we consider the scheduling of groups of passenger elevators in high rise buildings. We suggest advanced control algorithms for destination call systems, in which a passenger enters his desired destination floor already at his current floor. In addition to exploiting all degrees of freedom offered by the system, our reoptimization algorithms feature means to avoid decisions that will lead to undesirable online behavior ...",

            "title": "Computational Modeling of Fracture in Encapsulation-Based Self-Healing Concrete Using Cohesive Elements",
            "abstract": "Encapsulation-based self-healing concrete has received a lot of attention nowadays in civil engineering field. These capsules are embedded in the cementitious matrix during concrete mixing. When the cracks appear, the embedded capsules which are placed along the path of incoming crack are fractured and then release of healing agents in the vicinity of damage. The materials of capsules need to be designed in a way that they should be able to break with small deformation, so the internal fluid can be released to seal the crack. This study focuses on computational modeling of fracture in encapsulation-based selfhealing concrete. The numerical model of 2D and 3D with randomly packed aggreates and capsules have been developed to analyze fracture mechanism that plays a significant role in the fracture probability of capsules and consequently the self-healing process. The capsules are assumed to be made of Poly Methyl Methacrylate (PMMA) and the potential cracks are represented by pre-inserted cohesive elements with tension and shear softening laws along the element boundaries of the mortar matrix, aggregates, capsules, and at the interfaces between these phases. The effects of volume fraction, core-wall thickness ratio, and mismatch fracture properties of capsules on the load carrying capacity of self-healing concrete and fracture probability of the capsules are investigated. The output of this study will become valuable tool to assist not only the experimentalists but also the manufacturers in designing an appropriate capsule material for self-healing concrete.",

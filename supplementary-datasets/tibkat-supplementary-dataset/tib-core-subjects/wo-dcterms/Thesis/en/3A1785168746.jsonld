            "title": "Disinfection efficacy, mechanism and potential application of commercial proteases against fish viruses",
            "abstract": "Throughout history, fish has been one of the vital sources of food for humankind. Within the last decades, aquaculture production has grown steadily following the increased utilization of fish products and the need for bio-sustainability of fish species. Even though viral diseases give rise to continuous and serious economic losses, most of the diseases have no commercial vaccines or treatments against them. Thus, disinfection is one of the most efficient and important prevention methods for disease management. Many chemical disinfectants have been developed and applied in fish ponds but they commonly show negative effects on human health and often cause environmental problems. In a previous study, the commercially available protease Neutrase\u00ae derived from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens showed potential as a virucide. Following this result, we aimed to find effective and eco-friendly disinfection substances showing virucidal efficacy in vitro and in vivo in this study. This work focuses on the virucidal efficacy of two proteases, Neutrase\u00ae and Alcalase\u00ae, against four different fish viruses: koi herpesvirus (KHV), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). The virucidal efficacy of proteases was related to the morphology of the virus and the water temperature during application. Enveloped viruses \u2013 KHV, VHSV, IHNV \u2013 lost their infectivity up to 4-log titer after the treatment, while no inactivation of IPNV was observed. Protease induced infectivity reduction was more effective against viruses stable at 26 \u00b0C (KHV) than against those stable in colder environments at 15 \u00b0C (VHSV and IHNV). For disinfection, a lower concentration of Alcalase\u00ae was required than Neutrase\u00ae. Despite the higher price of Alcalase\u00ae, the low effective dosage offsets the cost so that in terms of practical application, Alcalase\u00ae is to be preferred. However, the handling of Alcalase\u00ae in the pond seems to be more arduous due to its higher toxicity in ...",

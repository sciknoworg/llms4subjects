            "abstract": "Plant responses to wounding are of central importance during defence against herbivores and therefore tightly regulated. Hereby the isoleucin conjugate of jasmonic acid (JA-Ile) is a major regulatory molecule. In this thesis, phosphoinositide (PI) signals not previously implicated in plant wound responses have been studied and are introduced as new components active in the signalling network regulating plant defence responses. Transgenic Arabidopsis InsP 5-ptase plants that are attenuated in PI signalling exhibited decreased wound-induced gene expression as well as reduced defence against caterpillar feeding. These results indicate that wound-induced accumulation of PI signals is required for full wounding and defence responses. Besides their attenuated defence, InsP 5-ptase plants accumulated JA-Ile in a pattern also found for JA-insensitive Arabidopsis coi1 mutants. These data suggest that InsP 5-ptase plants are partially insensitive towards JA-Ile. To explain the interdependency of PI-derived signals and JA-Ile perception, the Arabidopsis JA-Ile receptor, COI1, was compared with the auxin receptor, TIR1, which contains an inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) cofactor. Based on the structural similarity of COI1 and TIR1 the possibility was explored that an inositol polyphosphate cofactor is required for COI1 function. COI1 variants, in which putative inositol polyphosphate ...",

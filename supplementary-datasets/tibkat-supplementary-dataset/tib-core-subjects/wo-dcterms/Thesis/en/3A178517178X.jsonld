            "title": "Super-resolution microscopy of plasma membrane receptors",
            "abstract": "Plasma membrane receptors are the most crucial and most commonly studied components of cells, since they not only ensure communication between the extracellular space and cells, but are also responsible for the regulation of cell cycle and cell division. The composition of the surface receptors, the so-called Receptome\", differs and is characteristic for certain cell types. Due to their significance, receptors have been important target structures for diagnostic and therapy in cancer medicine and often show aberrant expression patterns in various cancers compared to healthy cells. However, these aberrations can also be exploited and targeted by different medical approaches, as in the case of personalized immunotherapy. In addition, advances in modern fluorescence microscopy by so-called single molecule techniques allow for unprecedented sensitive visualization and quantification of molecules with an attainable spatial resolution of 10-20 nm, allowing for the detection of both stoichiometric and expression density differences. In this work, the single molecule sensitive method dSTORM was applied to quantify the receptor composition of various cell lines as well as in primary samples obtained from patients with hematologic malignancies. The focus of this work lies on artefact free quantification, stoichiometric analyses of oligomerization states and co localization analyses of membrane receptors. Basic requirements for the quantification of receptors are dyes with good photoswitching properties and labels that specifically mark the target structure without generating background through non-specific binding. To ensure this, antibodies with a predefined DOL (degree of labeling) were used, which are also standard in flow cytometry. First background reduction protocols were established on cell lines prior analyses in primary patient samples. Quantitative analyses showed clear expression differences between the cell lines and the patient cells, but also between individual patients. An important component of this work is the ability to detect the oligomerization states of receptors, which enables a more accurate quantification of membrane receptor densities compared to standard flow cytometry. It also provides information about the activation of a certain receptor, for example of FLT3, a tyrosine kinase, dimerizing upon activation. For this purpose, different well-known monomers and dimers were compared to distinguish the typical localization statistics of single bound antibodies from two or more antibodies that are in proximity. Further experiments as well as co localization analyses proved that antibodies can bind to closely adjacent epitopes despite their size. These analytical methods were subsequently applied for quantification and visualization of receptors in two clinically relevant examples. Firstly, various therapeutically relevant receptors such as CD38, BCMA and SLAMF7 for multiple myeloma, a malignant disease of plasma cells, were analyzed and quantified on patient cells. Furthermore, the influence of TP53 and KRAS mutations on receptor expression levels was investigated using the multiple myeloma cell lines OPM2 and AMO1, showing clear differences in certain receptor quantities. Secondly, FLT3 which is a therapeutic target receptor for acute myeloid leukemia, was quantified and stoichiometrically analyzed on both cell lines and patient cells. In addition, cells that have developed resistance against midostaurin were compared with cells that still respond to this type I tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor for their FLT3 receptor expression and oligomerization state.",

            "title": "Evolution of major histocompatibility complex genes in New World bats and their functional importance in parasite resistance and life-history decisions in the lesser bulldog bat (Noctilio albiventris)",
            "abstract": "Immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) constitute a central component of the adaptive immune system and play an essential role in parasite resistance and associated life-history strategies. In addition to pathogen-mediated selection also sexual selection mechanisms have been identified as the main drivers of the typically-observed high levels of polymorphism in functionally important parts of the MHC. The recognition of the individual MHC constitution is presumed to be mediated through olfactory cues. Indeed, MHC genes are in physical linkage with olfactory receptor genes and alter the individual body odour. Moreover, they are expressed on sperm and trophoplast cells. Thus, MHC-mediated sexual selection processes might not only act in direct mate choice decisions, but also through cryptic processes during reproduction. Bats (Chiroptera) represent the second largest mammalian order and have been identified as important vectors of newly emerging infectious diseases affecting humans and wildlife. In addition, they are interesting study subjects in evolutionary ecology in the context of olfactory communication, mate choice and associated fitness benefits. Thus, it is surprising that Chiroptera belong to the least studied mammalian taxa in terms of their MHC evolution. In my doctoral thesis I aimed to gain insights in the evolution and diversity pattern of functional MHC genes in some of the major New World bat families by establishing species-specific primers through genome-walking into unknown flanking parts of familiar sites. Further, I took a free-ranging population of the lesser bulldog bat (Noctilio albiventris) in Panama as an example to understand the functional importance of the individual MHC constitution in parasite resistance and reproduction as well as the possible underlying selective forces shaping the observed diversity. My studies indicated that the typical MHC characteristics observed in other mammalian orders, like evidence for balancing and positive selection as well as recombination and gene conversion events, are also present in bats shaping their MHC diversity. I found a wide range of copy number variation of expressed DRB loci in the investigated species. In Saccopteryx bilineata, a species with a highly developed olfactory communication system, I found an exceptionally high number of MHC loci duplications generating high levels of variability at the individual level, which has never been described for any other mammalian species so far. My studies included for the first time phylogenetic relationships of MHC genes in bats and I found signs for a family-specific independent mode of evolution of duplicated genes, regardless whether the highly variable exon 2 (coding for the antigen binding region of the molecule) or more conserved exons (3, 4; encoding protein stabilizing parts) were considered indicating a monophyletic origin of duplicated loci within families. This result questions the general assumed pattern of MHC evolution in mammals where duplicated genes of different families usually cluster together suggesting that duplication occurred before speciation took place, which implies a trans-species mode of evolution. However, I found a trans-species mode of evolution within genera (Noctilio, Myotis) based on exon 2 signified by an intermingled clustering of DRB alleles. The gained knowledge on MHC sequence evolution in major New World bat families will facilitate future MHC investigations in this order. In the N. albiventris study population, the single expressed MHC class II DRB gene showed high sequence polymorphism, moderate allelic variability and high levels of population-wide heterozygosity. Whereas demographic processes had minor relevance in shaping the diversity pattern, I found clear evidence for parasite-mediated selection. This was evident by historical positive Darwinian selection maintaining diversity in the functionally important antigen binding sites, and by specific MHC alleles which were associated with low and high ectoparasite burden according to predictions of the \u2018frequency dependent selection hypothesis\u2019. Parasite resistance has been suggested to play an important role in mediating costly life history trade-offs leading to e.g. MHC- mediated benefits in sexual selection. The \u2018good genes model\u2019 predicts that males with a genetically well-adapted immune system in defending harmful parasites have the ability to allocate more resources to reproductive effort. I found support for this prediction since non-reproductive adult N. albiventris males carried more often an allele associated with high parasite loads, which differentiated them genetically from reproductively active males as well as from subadults, indicating a reduced transmission of this allele in subsequent generations. In addition, they suffered from increased ectoparasite burden which presumably reduced resources to invest in reproduction. Another sign for sexual selection was the observation of gender-specific difference in heterozygosity, with females showing lower levels of heterozygosity than males. This signifies that the sexes differ in their selection pressures, presumably through MHC-mediated molecular processes during reproduction resulting in a male specific heterozygosity advantage. My data make clear that parasite-mediated selection and sexual selection are interactive and operate together to form diversity at the MHC. Furthermore, my thesis is one of the rare studies contributing to fill the gap between MHC-mediated effects on co-evolutionary processes in parasite-host-interactions and on aspects of life-history evolution.",

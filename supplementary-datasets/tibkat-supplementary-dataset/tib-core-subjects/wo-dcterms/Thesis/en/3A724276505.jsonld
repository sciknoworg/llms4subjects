            "title": "Modulation of synaptic transmission by the voltage-gated potassium channel Eag1",
            "abstract": "The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv10.1 is widely expressed in the mammalian brain, but its function has not been described. Previous studies revealed highest expression levels in hippocampus and cerebellum and suggested a synaptic localization of the channel. We studied the role of Kv10.1 in cerebellar physiology using whole-cell patch clamp and 2-photon Ca2+ imaging in Kv10.1-deficient mice and wildtype controls. The excitability and action potential shape of granule cell bodies was unchanged despite the high expression of Kv10.1 mRNA, providing functional evidence for synaptic localization of Kv10.1 in neurons. Ca2+-influx into parallel fiber boutons was enhanced in mutants in response to stimulation with 3 action potentials, but not after one pulse. Further, mutants exhibited increased facilitation at the parallel fiber C\u034f\u0308 Purkinje cell synapse at high input frequencies. We propose that Kv10.1 serves a double role in the presynapse. In the slow state, it is implicated in controlling excitability, whereas repeated activity of the cell accelerates its activation kinetics and turn Kv10.1 into an important modulator of action potential shape during repetitive high-frequency stimulation. Like this, it serves to prevent excessive excitation of the terminal when other potassium channels suffer cumulative inactivation.",

            "abstract": "The past decade has observed a resurgence of peasant politics in Colombia. After the most intense period of armed conflict-related violence against the rural population (1985 \u2013 2006), and amid the enforcement of the land restitution policy and the peace negotiation between the Colombian Government and the former FARC-EP guerrilla movement, the country observed a revival of social mobilization from the countryside. While the motives of this new cycle of peasant mobilization varied at different levels \u2013 from local to national \u2013, peasants protested against current forms of land dispossession, labelled by agrarian studies literature as the global land and resource rush. One of the most salient characteristics of this wave of peasant politics was the articulation of institutional right-claiming mechanisms with other repertoires of contestation. This research examines the historical trajectories and the current implications of one of the most salient institutional change processes conducted by peasant movements in Colombia, namely the transformation of the rules for the allocation of property rights over public lands. The central research question is how and to what extent peasant agency impacts agrarian institutions and what are its implications on disputes over land and resource grabbing in the 21st century? The study demonstrates that the outcomes of the recent legal debates about the rules for allocation of property rights over public lands hinge upon the historical trajectories of peasant mobilization in Colombia, particularly as observed through the interaction between social and state actors.",

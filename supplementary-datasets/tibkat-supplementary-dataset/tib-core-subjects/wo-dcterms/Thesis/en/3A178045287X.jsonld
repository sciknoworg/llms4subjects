            "abstract": "In recent years, Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI) have gained popularity as a modern psychotherapeutic approach, primarily in English-speaking countries. A growing body of evidence demonstrates the clinical benefits of MBI for a wide range of symptoms experienced in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD). However, research in German- speaking countries remains scarce. Against this background, the present dissertation aims to contribute to the available body of literature by developing and validating a Mindfulness-Based Group Therapy (MBGT) for the treatment of inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This comprehensive research study will include both qualitative and quantitative data analysis concerning the three subprojects revealed below. A qualitative research design based on inductive thematic analysis in the form of a semi- structured interview guide was developed and 27 interviews were conducted with inpatients having SSD after attending a mindfulness-based intervention in study one. Analyses revealed two domains (content and function) of MBI. The domain content had further subcategories, including core elements, as well as effects on emotions, cognition, and symptoms changes. The second domain was related to the relevance of perception of context and transfer to everyday life. Overall, individuals reported improvements on several clinical parameters and gave an in- depth understanding of underlying processes and mechanisms at action. Based on these outcomes, a novel Mindfulness-Based Group Therapy (MBGT) was developed for the first time in the German language through a fundamental participatory and iterative research process and finally published in a manual's printed book form. Moreover, historical concerns regarding the therapeutic utility of mindfulness for SSD are discussed, while recommendations and careful adaptations are given to implement MBI in inpatient and outpatient settings as a part of an editorial article. In study two, the newly translated German version of the Southampton ...",

            "abstract": "Prescription opioids are used for the treatment of chronic and severe pain. When used appropriately, they are an essential part of pain therapy. But opioids may also pose serious risks. Addiction to opioids and their abuse has led to an epidemic, which demanded about 50.000 people's lives in 2017 in the USA.44 The \u00b5-opioid receptor (\u00b5OR) agonist PZM2118 is functionally selective (biased) towards G protein signaling, which has been associated with an improved side-effect profile in studies with mice.18 Taking this as a starting point, the aim of this thesis was the modification of PZM21 to further elucidate how the structural features of PZM21 determine its unique biological activity and optimize \u00b5OR specificity and pharmacokinetic properties, where applicable. The development of novel PZM21 derivatives was guided by a rational design approach taking both structural- and ligand-based information into account. The structure-based design involved molecular docking experiments using the softwares AutoDock Vina 1.1.270 and GOLD71. Ligand-based information, like binding affinity and functional activity, was kindly provided by Dr. Harald H\u00fcbner. Bioisosteric replacement of the urea moiety A convergent synthetic route was chosen for the synthesis of new urea derivatives based on three building blocks (Figure 49). The amino acid-derived- and the alkylamine building block were fused by a central urea replacement incorporating thiourea-, N-cyanoguanidine-, 1,1-diaminonitroethylene- and malonodinitrile functionalities. The amino acid-derived building block 1 (Figure 49) was synthesized from commercially available L-tyrosine amide, a semi-synthetic product of the natural amino acid L-tyrosine. The same synthetic route was applied in the synthesis of L-meta-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, L-5-OH-tryptophan and 4-difluor-phenylalanine derivatives. Depending on the commercial availability, the syntheses started from the amino acid, the amino acid ester or the amino acid amide. The urea replacement 2 and the alkylamine building block 3 ...",

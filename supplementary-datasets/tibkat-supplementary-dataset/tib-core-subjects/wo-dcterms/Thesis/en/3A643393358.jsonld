            "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms, Marine dinoflagellate, Alexandrium tamarense, allelopathy, lytic compounds, cell lysis. - In this thesis, allelochemistry of Alexandrium tamarense, a well-known producer of saxitoxin and its analogues was investigated in an attempt to interpret the chemical characteristics and mode of action of the allelochemicals produced. As the response of target cells was lysis, the allelochemicals were thereafter designated as lytic compounds. One A. tamarense clonal strain, Alex2, with potent lytic activity, was chosen as the producer of the lytic compounds. Another A. tamarense clonal strain from the same geographical population, but without measurable lytic activity was introduced as a negative control. First, a cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina bioassay was used to guide the isolation and eventual structural characterization of the unknown lytic substances. Highest lytic activity per cell of A. tamarense cultures was achieved in the stationary growth phase, however, the allelopathic potency per cell remained constant throughout the entire exponential phase. The supernatant of stationery cell cultures prepared via centrifugation was chosen as the major source of lytic compounds for research through out the whole thesis. Further isolation and purification of the supernatant often resulted in major loss or even disappearance of lytic activity, prompting the physico/chemical characterization of the lytic compounds. Although temporal stability of the lytic compounds was high, in that the lytic activity was stable over wide ranges of temperatures and pH and was refractory to bacterial degradation (at least of the bacteria consortium present in the cultures), substantial losses were evident during purification. The lytic compounds possessed high adsorption to various materials including polycarbonate and other plastics, glass, etc. Additionally, the lytic activity was reduced when stored at low concentration, in deionized water, or in vessels with large surface area/volume ratios. Similar to the bioactivity of allelochemicals produced among other harmful algal bloom species, A. tamarense produced a suite of metabolites acting as lytic compounds. At least two groups of lytic compounds with various polarities were separated and quantified via reversed phase solid phase extraction (SPE). Emphasis was put on the less polar fraction because of its higher lytic activity. Further purification of this SPE fraction was performed via both C8 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and hydrophilic interaction ion-chromatography (HILIC).

            "abstract": "The causes and underlying pathomechanisms of persistent stuttering have been obscure for a long time. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest a maladaptive cortical and subcortical morphology and compromised related neural computations of sensory-motor information including speech as well as non-speech domains. The three studies presented in this dissertation advance the knowledge about the pathophysiology and pathomechanisms in persistent stuttering. In the first study repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) helped discovering a dysfunction of the left dorsolateral premotor cortex in control of paced finger movements and a compensatory role of its right hemispheric homologue in stuttering. While previous neuroimaging studies elucidated altered activation patterns, we were able to directly show for the first time that the right hemisphere might indeed play a compensatory rather than maladaptive role for non-speech functions in persistent developmental stuttering. In the second study we aimed at detecting neurophysiological changes in the primary motor tongue representation of the left and right hemisphere in adults with persistent stuttering. Overcoming methodological challenges of transcranial magnetic stimulation at orofacial structures, this is the first study demonstrating an abnormality in intracortical excitability in persistent stuttering. The third study operationalized a behavioral approach to elucidate a possible disconnection between parieto-temporal regions involved in the phonological bottom up processing of speech stimuli and frontal regions mainly involved in the planning, programming and execution of speech movements. Behavioral deviations on a subclinical level might indicate a disturbed functional connectivity of these main networks of speech processing.",

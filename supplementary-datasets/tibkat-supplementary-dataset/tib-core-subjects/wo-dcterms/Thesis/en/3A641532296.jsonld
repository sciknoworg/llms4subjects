            "abstract": "The aim of the project was the evaluation of an alternative to the usage of hormonal treatment in order to produce rainbow trout neo-males for an all female production by mating these neo-males to normal rainbow trout females. The pursued approach to influence the sex differentiation in rainbow trout is based on the modification of the rearing temperature post hatching, during the early alevin stage. This has been scientifically proven to be effective in other fish species, e.g. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). After the technical optimization of the treatment procedure a temperature treatment of 18 \u02bfC for 30 days was applied to ongoing experiments starting two weeks post hatching. The survival rates of the fry after temperature treatment did not differ significantly from the corresponding control groups. Depending on the population and family, the applied temperature treatments led to a significant increase in the percentage of females (up to 83%) or to a significant decrease in female percentages (down to 30%) in comparison to the untreated full sib control groups. The results obtained from repeated matings of identical mating partners differed only by 1 to 6% females in their offspring. Both, female and male spawners, contributed to the different sex ratios in temperature treated groups ...",

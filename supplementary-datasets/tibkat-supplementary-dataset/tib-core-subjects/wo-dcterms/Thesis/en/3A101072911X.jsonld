                "The present degree thesis wants to contribute to the discussion of self-organization in Personal Learning Environments (PLE) within the framework of university teaching. As a result of the question to which extent the specifically coordinated fostering of self-learning and media competency can promote self-organized learning in a personal learning environment at all these two analysis foci will be considered as self-organization dispositions within an online seminar. Starting from the theoretical derivation about the concept of PLEs right up to the self-organization the self-learning competency and the media competency are located in the current discourse. As part of the didactic design and technical realization of a pure online event called a Successful studying with the Interneta , the research construct is examined from summer term 2010 to winter term 2014/15 (sample = 224). The research design which is composed of both quantitative and qualitative research methods and has been applied over a period of ten semesters confirms that brought media competence can be advantageous in order to handle the learning tools / methods presented in the seminar. However, students are only successful in using the tools if they have a solid foundation for mainly deep-oriented learning strategies. In addition to the support of media literacy the thesis encourages to advance in particular the self-learning competency of learners in order to prepare them for the ever-changing requirements of a digitized information society.",

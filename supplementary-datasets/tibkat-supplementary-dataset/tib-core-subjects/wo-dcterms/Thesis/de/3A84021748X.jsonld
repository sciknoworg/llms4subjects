                "Having been regarded as wastelands until quite recently, wetlands are increasingly acknowledged as ecosystems of high biodiversity. Wetland restoration projects are often accompanied by the implementation of specific species management programs. Naturally, for effective management measures, profound knowledge of the target species? ecological requirements is obligatory, including habitat selection, feeding ecology as well as spatial behaviour such as movements within and between patches of suitable habitat. Yet, big knowledge gaps exist for many marshland birds which is particularly true for highly secretive species such as rails and crakes. Considered as the least known among the Palaearctic breeding birds, most information about the Baillon?s Crake Zapornia pusilla is only anecdotic, resulting in strong uncertainties with regard to the species? distribution, population sizes, status, migratory behaviour as well as ecological requirements. This can be mainly attributed to the species? skulking behaviour and its seemingly highly erratic occurrence. Baillon?s Crakes in the Western Palaearctic and Palaeotropics are referred to as the subspecies Z. p. intermedia. While European breeding birds are assumed to winter in sub-Saharan wetlands, African populations are considered rather to be itinerant with local movements induced by seasonal or anthropogenic habitat changes. However, for both migratory movements, major directions or routes are unknown. The discovery of a large number ..."

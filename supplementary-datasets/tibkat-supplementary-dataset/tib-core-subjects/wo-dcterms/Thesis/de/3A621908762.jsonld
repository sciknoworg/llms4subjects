                "Despite a very high functional diversity within the a/\u00df-hydrolase fold superfamily the enzymes within that class show very high structural homology. Due to that fact it is believed that they developed from a common ancestor by divergent evolution. By using different methods of protenengineering, members of that family should be converted into each other. As model enzyme an esterase from Pseudomonas fluorescens and an epoxide hydrolase from Agrobacterium radiobacter were used. After establishment of sufficient analytical tools to measure epoxide hydrolase activity and esterase activity, respectively, sequence and structural alignments were performed in order to identify amino acids that are essential to the corresponding reaction mechanism. The mutations have been incorporated by site-directed mutagenesis and the mutants have been investigated towards the new activity. Unfortunately, none of the enzymes showed the desired function. Afterwards, there were performed further structural analysis to identify secondary elements which might be important to the activity. There were substituted whole segments of the PFE by those of the EchA. After coexpression with chaperones the enzymes were purified and analyzed ..."

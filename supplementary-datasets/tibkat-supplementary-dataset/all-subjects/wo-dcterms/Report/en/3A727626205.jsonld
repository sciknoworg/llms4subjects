            "title": "Complete damage in linear elastic materials : modeling, weak formulation and existence results",
            "abstract": "We introduce a complete damage model with a time-depending domain for linear-elastically stressed solids under time-varying Dirichlet boundary conditions. The evolution of the system is described by a doubly nonlinear differential inclusion for the damage process and a quasi-static balance equation for the displacement field. For the introduced complete damage model, we propose a classical formulation and a corresponding suitable weak formulation in an $SBV$-framework. We show that the classical differential inclusion can be regained from the notion of weak solutions under certain regularity assumptions. The main aim of this work is to prove local-in-time existence and global-in-time existence in some weaker sense for the introduced model. In contrast to incomplete damage theories, the material can be exposed to damage in the proposed model in such a way that the elastic behavior may break down on the damaged parts of the material, i.e. we loose coercivity properties of the free energy. This leads to several mathematical difficulties. For instance, it might occur that not completely damaged material regions are isolated from the Dirichlet boundary. In this case, the deformation field cannot be controlled in the transition from incomplete to complete damage. To tackle this problem, we consider the evolution process on a time-depending domain. In this context, two major challenges arise: Firstly, the time-dependent domain approach leads to jumps in the energy which have to be accounted for in the energy inequality of the notion of weak solutions. To handle this problem, several energy estimates are established by $Gamma$-convergence techniques. Secondly, the time-depending domain might have bad smoothness properties such that Korn's inequality cannot be applied. To this end, a covering result for such sets with smooth compactly embedded domains has been shown.",

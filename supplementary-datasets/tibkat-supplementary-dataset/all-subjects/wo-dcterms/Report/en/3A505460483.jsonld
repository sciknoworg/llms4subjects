            "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations of possible ligands for proteins yield large amounts of data in the form of trajectories which are further processed in order to find metastable conformations. These conformations can then be used for docking between ligand and protein. Around this core computation procedure lots of other data have to be managed. It should also be possible for external users not involved in program development to perform computations. As a paradigm for other fields where a similar constitution of program usage and data processing is found we present a software architecture for data generation, access and management. Requirements for this system include: Ease of use, graphical user interface, persistent storage of data concerning molecules, users, programs, program parameters, metadata, and results. A mere storage in the file system would render a quick overview of data more or less impossible. On the other hand, storing large amounts of binary data in a database doesnt yield any advantage concerning speed of access. Therefore, a hybrid approach combining file system and database is appropriate. The system should be easily extensible by inserting new applications which can be controlled and whose results can be collected and stored ...",

            "abstract": "Energy transition requires policy measures that impact housing, energy, transport and other aspects of our everyday lives. Socially and economically disadvantaged groups are most affected by distributional impacts of climate policies \u2013 such as rising fuel taxes or closing coal mines. This puts efforts to tackle the global threat of climate warming at risk. Listen to the vulnerable people is what we have done: In different European countries, we have listened to the concerns and ideas of economically and socially disadvantaged people unheard in the current debate. The idea was to start from people\u2019s experiences and to adapt concrete solutions to and with them, while taking insights from existing studies on the subject into account. We wanted to know: \u2022 How to ensure that the costs and benefits of the energy transition are shared fairly across society \u2022 How Europe and countries can avoid that policies hit the pockets of poorer households the hardest \u2022 How to best combine action for energy transition and social justice Our two main goals during the process were to: \u2022 Better understand the views, fears, and emotions of vulnerable people on the energy transition and on its current and potential impact on their living conditions. \u2022 Provide input to national and European policy makers, researchers, and stakeholders in the devel-opment of fair energy transition policies.",

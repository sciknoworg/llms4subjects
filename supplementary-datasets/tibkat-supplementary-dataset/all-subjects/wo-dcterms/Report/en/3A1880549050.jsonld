            "abstract": "This project report presents results from a proof-of-concept (PoC) on a load-based performance test for hydronic heat pumps, namely the compensation method. The project partners have extended the compensation method developed by BAM by a simplified building model which is implemented in the test stand control to aligne inertia of different test stands. This yields more representative test results and higher reproducibility. To proof the feasibility and applicability of the new concept the interaction of the heat pump controller and test stand including the building model is studied. Three heat pumps from different manufacturers were tested in three different labs with different test stand architectures. Different control strategies of the heat pump were also tested (fixed vs. variable flow, additional indoor air temperature control). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of permissible deviations on the coefficient of performance. Thus, the project also aims to provide data to set permissible deviations in the BAM test guideline and identify aspects which must be improved. Finally, the impact of inertia on operating behaviour and COP is assessed to confirm the need for the building model integration. The tests have shown that the building model can be implemented within few weeks in the most common test stand architectures (direct and indirect method) while achieving sufficient level of control on the return temperature. The tests under full and part-load conditions have proven realistic operating behaviour. An improvement potential of the test rig was identified to increase controllability during defrost which could be implemented successfully by the labs. It was also shown that the electrical back-up heater can be included in the test which yields more realistic test results. It could also be shown that inertia changes operating behaviour and should be aligned to ensure the same operation in all labs. It was found that the change in operating behaviour results in different COPs. Therefore, inertia of different labs must be aligned. The approach proposed by the project partners has been proven feasible and the results and findings from the proof of concept are transferred to standardisation at CEN/TC 113/WG 8 and to the review process of the Ecodesign and Energy Labelling regulations for space heaters on EU-level. The successful proof of concept is followed by a validation phase to study reproducibility of the revised compensation method in a round robin test (38943/01). The round robin test will yield further data to improve the test guideline and allow participating labs to gain experience in load-based testing. The round robin test and the proof of concept are funded by the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU). The Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) and the Institut f\u00fcr Luft- und K\u00e4ltetechnik gemeinn\u00fctzige Gesellschaft mbH (ILK Dresden) were commissioned to perform the measurements within this project. The three tested heat pumps were kindly provided by different manufacturers.",

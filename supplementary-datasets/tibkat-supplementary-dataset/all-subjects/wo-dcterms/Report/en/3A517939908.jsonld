            "abstract": "In this paper, we study the approxmimability of three network planning problems with unsplittable shortest path routing (USPR) and discuss the relation of USPR to other routing schemes. Given a digraph  and a set  of directed commodities, an unsplittable shortest path routing is a set of flow paths , , such that there exists a metric  with respect to which each  is the unique shortest -path. We prove that the minimum congestion unsplittable shortest path routing problem MIN-CON-USPR of finding an USPR that minimizes the maximum congestion over all arcs is -hard, and we present a simple -approximation algorithm for this problem. We also construct examples where the minimum congestion that can be obtained with an USPR is a factor of  larger than the congestion of an optimal unsplittable flow routing or an optimal shortest multi-path routing, and a factor of  larger than the congestion of an optimal unsplittable source-invariant routing. This indicates that USPR problems are indeed harder than their corresponding unsplittable flow, shortest multi-path, and unsplittable source-invariant routing problems. We also show that the fixed charge network design problem (FC-USPR), where the task is to find a minimum cost subgraph of D whose fixed arc capacities admit an USPR of the given commodities ...",

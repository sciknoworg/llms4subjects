            "abstract": "\"This report follows the progress of the experimental programme of coppiced tree production carried out by the Forestry Commission for the Energy Technical Support Unit of the Department of Energy and the European Community. It describes the establishment and early growth of a series of forest/field experiments designed to measure the wood production of a range of tree species, crop spacings and rotations. The experiments are sited to reflect broad environmental zones and site types. The forest system used in the experiment is short rotation coppice for fuelwood production, and the report discusses the first three years' results, and problems encountered during the establishment phase. Results, in terms of tonnes of dry biomass per hectare per year, vary from nil to between 3 and 7 tonnes dry ha yr_1 for willow, poplar and eucalyptus. Alder, Southern beech and coppice from existing native species have not yet yielded harvestable material. The 2 metre spacing has a substantially lower production than 1 metre spacing and the age of maiden growth also appears to have an influence on subsequent production, greater values being obtained from 2 year than 1 year stools. The moisture content of fresh cut material has averaged 55.5% on a wet weight basis with little variation between species. It is essential to continue the experiments to determine the full effects on production levels of species, spacing, rotation length and age at first cut.\" - (Euro-abstracts, Section 1, Vol. 24, No 5, May 1986)",

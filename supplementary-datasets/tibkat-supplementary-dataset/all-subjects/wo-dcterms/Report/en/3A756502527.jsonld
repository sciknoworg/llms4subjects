            "abstract": "The wonderful book by Andrews, Askey, and Roy [2] is mainly devoted to special functions of hypergeometric type  to the plain hypergeometric series and integrals and their q-analogues. Shortly before its publication there appeared first examples of hypergeometric functions of a new type related to elliptic curves. A systematic theory of elliptic hypergeometric functions was constructed in 2000-2004 over a short period of time. The present complement reviews briefly the status of this theory by the fall of 2011. It repeats where possible the structure of the book [2], and it is substantially based on author&rsquo;s thesis [66] and survey [70]. The theory of quantum and classical completely integrable systems played a crucial role in the discovery of these new special functions. An elliptic extension of the terminating very-well-poised balanced q-hypergeometric series 10'9 with discrete values of parameters appeared for the first time in elliptic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation [28] associated with the exactly solvable models of statistical mechanics [19]. The same terminating series with arbitrary parameters appeared in [78] as a particular solution of a pair of linear finite difference equations, the compatibility condition of which yields the most general known (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear integrable chain analogous to the discrete time Toda chain. An elliptic analogue of Euler's gamma function depending on two bases p and q of modulus less than 1, which already appeared in Baxter's eight vertex model [7], was investigated in [56], and in [64] a modified elliptic gamma function was constructed for which one of the bases may lie on the unit circle. ...",

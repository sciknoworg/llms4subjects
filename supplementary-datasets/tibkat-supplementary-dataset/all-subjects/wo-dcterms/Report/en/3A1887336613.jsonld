            "abstract": "This report describes the results of the project \u201cNature Conservation and Conflict in Ukraine: Identifying War Damage to Nature Reserves in Ukraine\u201d (Ukraine-Nature) that was implemented by the Research and Transfer Centre \u201cSustainable Development and Climate Change Management\u201d at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences and supported by the German Federal Environmental Foundation (Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt). Within this project the Ukraine-Nature team and partners from Ukraine, Poland and Switzerland conducted ecological research on the consequences of armed conflict in four protected nature reserves that are part of The Emerald Network \u2013 Chornobyl Radiation and Ecological Biosphere Reserve (REBR); Desniansko-Starohutskyi National Nature Park (NNP); Holosiivskyi National Nature Park (NNP), and Hetmanskyi National Nature Park (NNP). The war has made it difficult to maintain and protect these areas and has put additional pressure on ecosystems that are already threatened by human activities. Ukraine-Nature project delved into the significant yet often neglected environmental repercussions of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, highlighting the adverse effects on soil, biodiversity, and forests. In this context, this research aimed to provide an overview of the impacts of the war on the environment in four Ukrainian protected areas, namely the Chornobyl REBR, Holosiivskyi NNP, Desniansko-Starohutskyi NNP, and Hetmanskyi NNP. To address these aspects, the Ukraine-Nature team relied on several methods including bibliometric analysis, key informant interviews, GIS analyses based on satellite pictures as well as secondary data gathered by experts from the Ukraine Nature Project in two stages: during the expedition and extracted from databases (ACLED, FIRMS, Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and State Emergency Service of Ukraine) and processed by QGIS software.The obtained values were used to assess the level of damage for soil, forests, and biodiversity within the grids of 1*1 km2 by the degree of disturbance: absent, low, medium, above average, high, extremely high. All the results were mapped for each of the researched territories. It was discovered that habitats and biodiversity in these reserves are endangered by landmines, wildfires caused by artillery shelling and purposeful setting of fires in forested areas, armed clashes between opposing armed forces, military occupation of the land, and the movement and maintenance of military vehicles and machinery. Damages to forested areas in each reserve are extensive and soil sampling in the combat damaged zones conducted in October 2022 indicate that the impact of military activities on soils in the studies areas was found to be particularly significant, requiring special management and monitoring measures when peace returns to these reserves. The current evidence suggests ecological recovery of these nature reserves will be challenging, and some post-conflict restoration work may not be possible. In some cases, it is increasingly likely that some indigenous wildlife species and portions of the landscape will not recover and are likely to be gradually lost completely over time. The research also explored various methods as well as sustainable-oriented solutions aimed at mitigating these effects on the environment. Furthermore, it discusses the immediate and long-term challenges Ukraine faces in its recovery efforts, emphasizing the need for environmentally conscious approaches to address these issues. One of the main recommendations, for example, would be to ensure legal accountability for environmental war crimes and to intensify the efforts to stop the war. The limited access to the territories due to the mining and shelling, restricts researchers and society in acting towards recovery, and the main activities would rely in constant monitoring and assessment of environmental damages caused by the war. The results of the project were discussed with well-known media like 2DF, Die Zeit, 3SAT, etc. and presented at numerous conferences in Germany.",

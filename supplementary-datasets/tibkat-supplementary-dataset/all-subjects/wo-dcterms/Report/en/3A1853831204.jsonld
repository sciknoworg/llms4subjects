            "abstract": "The study \"Sustainable mobility concept EURO 2024\" deals with the promotion of sustainable mobility in the context of the European Football Championship 2024 (EURO 2024) in Germany. The transportation sector is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. For that reason, it is crucial to promote sustainable mobility as part of the fight against climate change. For major sports events such as the 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, the challenges in regards to sustainable mobility are particularly pronounced. Therefore, such events should integrate targeted measures to promote sustainable mobility during planning and implementation. This study is based on a comprehensive literature review and the evaluation of relevant studies with a special attention on European sports events of the past 17 years. The measures identified are analysed in relation to the spatial dimension of traffic volume as well as the involvement of different stakeholder groups. Based on these results, recommendations for sustainable mobility solutions in the context of EURO 2024 are presented. The results underline that a comprehensive cooperation between organizing committees, governments, transportation authorities, transportation companies and society is essential to achieve sustainable mobility at major sports events. Public participation in planning and decision-making processes and the integration of feedback loops can help to develop a shared vision and implement measures that are supported by all stakeholders. A comprehensive and integrated environmental strategy can help to reduce the environmental footprint of events while taking into account social and economic aspects. The study shows that the promotion of sustainable mobility at major sports events is an important factor for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Organisers of major sports events should integrate targeted measures to promote sustainable mobility into their planning and implementation. This will reduce the negative impact of transportation on the environment and quality of life in urban areas. It is important to implement these actions not only in short-term during the event but also long-term in the region in order to establish a sustainable mobility.",

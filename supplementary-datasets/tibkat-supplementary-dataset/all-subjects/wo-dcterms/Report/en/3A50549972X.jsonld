            "abstract": "This report combines the contributions to INOC 2005 (Wess\u00e4lly et al., 2005) and DRCN 2005 (Gruber et al., 2005). A new integer linear programming model for the end-to-end survivability concept deman d-wise shared protection (DSP) is presented. DSP is based on the idea that backup capacity is dedicated to a particular demand, but shared within a demand. It combines advantages of dedicated and shared protection: It is more cost-efficient than dedicated protection and operationally easier than shared protection. In a previous model for DSP, the number of working and backup paths to be configured for a particular demand has been an input parameter; in the more general model for DSP investigated in this paper, this value is part of the decisions to take. To use the new DSP model algorithmically, we suggest a branch-and-cut approach which employs a column generation procedure to deal with the exponential number of routing variables. A computational study to compare the new resilience mechanism DSP with dedicated and shared path protection is performed. The results for five realistic network planning scenarios reveal that the best solutions for DSP are on average 15% percent better than the corresponding 1+1 dedicated path protection solutions, and only 15% percent worse than shared path protection.",

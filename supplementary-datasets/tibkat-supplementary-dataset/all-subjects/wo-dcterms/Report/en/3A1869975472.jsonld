            "abstract": "The Waste Prevention Programme of the federal government with the participation of the states, which was first adopted in 2013, has been updated in 2021. Dialogue with various actors plays a decisive role in the implementation of the programme. To this end, the dialogues on the Waste Prevention Programme II took place in 2021 and 2022. In a total of eight dialogues with different thematic focuses, concrete approaches to the implementation of waste prevention measures were discussed. Dialogues one and two dealt with waste prevention in the area of textiles. Dialogues three and four dealt with disposable articles. The topic of waste prevention in event management was examined in dialogues five and six. Dialogues seven and eight concluded with discussions on educational measures for waste prevention and intercultural communication. About 30 people took part in each dialogue who have points of contact with the topic of waste prevention through their work or other commitments. Participants included representatives of the economy, politics and administration, research, civil society and associations. The dialogues were preceded by a situation analysis in which existing approaches and obstacles to waste prevention in the topic area were examined. At the end of each situation analysis, there were several theses that summarised the contents of the analysis. The dialogues always consisted of a webinar and a subsequent workshop. During the webinar, the findings of the situation analysis were explained and the participants had the opportunity to vote on the focus of the workshop with the help of the theses derived from the situation analysis. At the beginning of the workshops, there were always two to four short talks by people with a background in the according thematic field who gave the participants an initial stimulus. In the second phase of the workshop, participants had the opportunity to actively participate and share their thoughts using an online collaboration tool. A protocol and thematic support material, which was discussed with the participants during the dialogue, were published for each dialogue. The following report summarises all eight dialogues and ends with a conclusion. The Appendix consisting of the protocols and the situation analyses of the eight dialogues can be found in the German version of the final report.",

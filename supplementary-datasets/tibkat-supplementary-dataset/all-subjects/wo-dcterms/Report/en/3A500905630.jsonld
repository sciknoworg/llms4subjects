            "abstract": "The development of software product lines has become a new and promising field in software development in the last few years. Market asks for faster development of new software products which also must be cheap and of high quality. Here software product line engineering offers software companies the possibility to adress this market needs by also reducing the development costs. Software product line engineering is based on the domain engineering which provides a basis of core assets (also called platform), which in turn can be reused by thereon based applications in the application engineering. Thereby it is essential to model the variability which occurs among different applications derived from the platform.",

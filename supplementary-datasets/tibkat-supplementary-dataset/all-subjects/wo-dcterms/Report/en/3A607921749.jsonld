            "title": "Balancing efficiency and robustness - a bi-criteria optimization approach to railway track allocation",
            "abstract": "Technical restrictions and challenging details let railway traffic become one of the most complex transportation systems. Routing trains in a conflict-free way through a track network is one of the basic scheduling problems for any railway company. This article focuses on a robust extension of this problem, also known as train timetabling problem (TTP), which consists in finding a schedule, a conflict free set of train routes, of maximum value for a given railway network. However, timetables are not only required to be profitable. Railway companies are also interested in reliable and robust solutions. Intuitively, we expect a more robust track allocation to be one where disruptions arising from delays are less likely to be propagated causing delays of subsequent trains. This trade-off between an efficient use of railway infrastructure and the prospects of recovery leads us to a bi-criteria optimization approach. On the one hand we want to maximize the profit of a schedule, that is more or less to maximize the number of feasible routed trains. On the other hand if two trains are scheduled as tight as possible after each other it is clear that a delay of the first one always affects the subsequent train. We present extensions of the integer programming formulation in [BorndoerferSchlechte2007] for solving (TTP). These models can incorporate both aspects, because of the additional track configuration variables. We discuss how these variables can directly be used to measure a certain type of robustness of a timetable. For these models which can be solved by column generation techniques, we propose so-called scalarization techniques, see [Ehrgott2005], to determine efficient solutions ...",

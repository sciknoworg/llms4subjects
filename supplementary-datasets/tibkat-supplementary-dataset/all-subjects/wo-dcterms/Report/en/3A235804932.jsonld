            "abstract": "\"In the area of work concerning the collection of performance data from monitored solar projects, new emphasis has been placed in this contract period on solar domestic hot-water systems, and on the introduction of passive solar space-heating systems. In order to achieve the objectives stated in the preface, a total of 24 individual tasks were identified and allocated between Group members, according to experience and interest. In addition to carrying out individual tasks, Group members have been responsible for collecting data from monitored solar projects in their own country and recording it in the appropriate reporting format. Presented in this volume are first of all the reporting formats, reports on the projects and the completed formats on solar water and solar space-heating, a monitoring handbook, and recommendations for future developments and research. The three appendices contain cost-optimisation techniques for solar installations, optimum sample sizes for field trials of occupied housing with solar heating installations, with a case study, and procedures for system optimisation.\" - (Euro abstracts, 22.1984,3)",

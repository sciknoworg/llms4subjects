            "abstract": "We are motivated to model chemical vapor deposition for metallic bipolar plates and optimization to deposit a homogeneous layer. Moreover a constraint to the deposition process is a very low pressure (nearly vacuum) and a low temperature (about 400 K). These constraints need to have a catalyst process, here in our apparatus we deal with a plasma source and precursor gases. Such a plasma have the advantage to accelerate the vaporation process and to bring the solid materials to a gaseous phase. Nevertheless there are also some drawbacks, so that a retardation and adsorption process can hinder the direct transport to the target. Here, we present a mesoscopic model, which reflects the retardation, transport and reaction of the gaseous species through a homogeneous media in the chamber. The models include immobile gaseous phases, where the transport of the mobile gaseous species are hindered. Kinetically controlled adsorption are included to taken into account the multiple species of heavier and lighter species. Such ideas are also considered in fluid dynamical models. Further, the models include the conservation of mass and the porous media, are in accordance with the Darcy`s law, which is an assumption to the flow processes of the gaseous phase. The transport through the instationary and ionized plasma field is treated as a diffusion-dominated flow with mobile and immobile zones, where the metallic deposit and the gas chamber, looking like a porous media ...",

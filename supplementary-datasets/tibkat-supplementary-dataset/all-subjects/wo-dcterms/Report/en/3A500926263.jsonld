            "title": "Adaptive routing with stale information",
            "abstract": "We investigate adaptive routing policies for large networks in which agents reroute traffic based on old information. It is a well known and practically relevant problem that old information can lead to undesirable oscillation effects resulting in poor performance.  We investigate how adaptive routing policies should be designed such that these effects can be avoided. In our theoretical model, the network is represented by a general graph with latency functions on the edges. Traffic is managed by a large number of agents each of which is responsible for a negligible amount of traffic. Initially the agents' routing paths are chosen in an arbitrary fashion. From time to time each agent revises her routing strategy by sampling another path and switching with positive probability to this path if it promises smaller latencies. As the information on which the agent bases her decision might be stale, however, this does not necessarily lead to an improvement.  The points of time at which agents revise their strategy are generated by a Poisson distribution. Stale information is modelled in form of a bulletin board that is updated periodically and lists the latencies on all edges ...",

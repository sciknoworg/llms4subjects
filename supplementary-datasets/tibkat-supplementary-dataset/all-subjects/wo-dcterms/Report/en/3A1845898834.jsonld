            "abstract": "Culture and heritage play a key role in helping us to understand the causes and impacts of climate change and in designing responses, including low-carbon, climate-resilient pathways consistent with the aims of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Despite this importance (and noting growing policy attention), culture and heritage are not yet explicitly well connected to climate change at the international policy level. Similar gaps have been evident in climate science, such as in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The CCHIP-Project proposed to prepare for, host, and disseminate results of an international meeting on culture, heritage, and climate change organized under the co-sponsorship of the IPCC. This meeting would, for the first time ever, assess the state of knowledge regarding connections between culture, heritage, and climate change. A Model Project Germany paralleling the IPCC process had the aim of engaging German climate and cultural heritage experts and German speaking audiences more generally on the themes and outcomes of the larger CCHIP-Project.",

            "abstract": "The very first issue of Listen magazine was printed in July-September of 1948. In it, J. L. McElharry, President of the American Temperate Society, laid the aims and purposes of the new magazine. \"To enlighten the American public with the latest scientific and medical research on the effect of the use of alcoholic beverages on the human body. To promote better living, and a more abundant and happy life, and thus to offset the lure of alcohol, and other forms of intemperance.\" In the late forties and the fifties, Listen's primary focus was on alcohol. Experts were beginning to truly see the dangerous affects of drinking, and Listen shared the facts with the public. In the sixties and seventies, LSD, marijuana, heroin, and cocaine became the drugs of choice in the United States. During two psychedelic decades that many people spent in a drug-induced haze, Listen stood strong against drug use. The 80s saw the rising popularity of cocaine and crack cocaine. AIDS. By the 90s, the disease that surfaced ten years earlier had become an epidemic; it seemed that everyone knew someone with AIDS. Over fifty years since the first issue, and the goal of Listen magazine remains the same-teach kids about the consequences of drugs, offer help to those already involved, and promote the benefits of healthy living.",

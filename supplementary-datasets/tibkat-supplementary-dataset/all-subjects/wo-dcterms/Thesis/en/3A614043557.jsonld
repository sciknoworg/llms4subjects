            "abstract": "Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are violent releases of large plasma clouds at the sun. Up to now the mechanisms leading to the initiation of these ejections are not known. The interplanetary counterparts of CMEs are called ICMEs (Interplanetary CMEs). Approximately one third of all ICMEs detected in-situ at one AU distance from the sun show smooth rotation of the magnetic field vector (often accompanied by an enhanced magnetic field strength). These structures are called Magnetic Clouds (MCs). Their well ordered magnetic field makes them accessible to magnetic field modelling. Assuming a specific field topology and fitting models to the observed magnetic field data allows reconstruction of a spacecraft trajectory inside a MC. First we identified 67 MCs passing ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) from 2001 to 2007 by looking for MC specific plasma and magnetic field signatures. In a second step the magnetic field data was fitted with three different models. These models cover different field types (force-free and non force-free) and different geometries (circular and elliptic cross sections). As a first result we make a comparison between the fit results of the three models. Differences in elemental and charge state composition between MCs and ambient solar wind are well known (e. g. enhanced iron charge states, enhanced O7+ to O6+ ratios, and enhanced alpha to proton ratios). Now, we address the question, if these differences result from spacecraft trajectories through varying parts of the MC or from the MCs' diverse history of origins ...",

            "abstract": "The induction of a potent and long-lasting, broadly-neutralizing antibody response is generally considered one of the most promising approaches for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccination. Interestingly, several clinical and pre-clinical studies indicate a potential association of IgG Fc effector functions and their protective capacity. However, Env as the only HIV surface glycoprotein and main target of the humoral immune response, was shown to induce a largely TH2-associated IgG1 dominated antibody response, known for its low Fc receptor functionality. Recently, we demonstrated that Gag-specific T helper cells induced by DNA priming can enhance and modulate the HIV Env-specific B cell response upon virus-like particle (VLP) boost by intrastructural help (ISH), resulting in a more desirable TH1 associated IgG2a response. To minimize the induction of potentially harmful HIV-specific TH cells, this study investigates the possibility to harness heterologous TH cell responses induced by licensed and experimental vaccines. Based on the correlation of TH subtypes and IgG isotype, a detailed analysis of the respective TH cell response by differently adjuvanted licensed Hepatitis B vaccines was performed. To provide ISH, identified MHC-II restricted Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) derived peptides were genetically incorporated into the HIV Gag protein and used for VLP generation. ISH effects on Env-specific antibody levels were analyzed in mice primed with Engerix, Fendrix, Heplisav-B, or HBsAg DNA and boosted with VLPs. Although the respective vaccination regimens failed to modulate the Env-specific IgG response in a statistically significant manner, mice that received a TH1-promoting Hepatitis B priming showed trends towards IgG2a or IgG2c dominated immune responses. Accordingly, the experimental tuberculosis subunit vaccine H1 (Hybrid 1 fusion protein) in combination with the liposomal adjuvant CAF01, previously shown to induce a strong and long-lasting TH1 response, was used for equivalent mouse ...",

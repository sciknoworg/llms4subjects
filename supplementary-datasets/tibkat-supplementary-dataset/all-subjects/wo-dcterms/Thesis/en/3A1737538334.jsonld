                "This book mobilises the theory of uneven and combined development to uncover the geopolitical economic drivers of China\u2019s rise. The purpose is to explain the formation and trajectory of its economic \u2018accumulation system\u2019 \u2014 which remains a confounding hybrid of statist and neoliberal forms of capitalism \u2014 as the outcome of China\u2019s geopolitical engagement of the USA during the late stages of the Cold War, and its participation in manufacturing global production networks (GPNs). Fear of geopolitical catastrophe drove China to open its economy, while GPNs enabled China to generate substantial export surpluses which could be recycled through state-owned banks as cheap credit and subsidies to large, vertically integrated and politically-controlled state-owned enterprises. In this way, a synergy emerged between the \u2018neoliberal\u2019 and \u2018Keynesian-Fordist\u2019 sectors of the economy, while the national-territorial state retained its form and expanded its functions. The book chronicles how this reliance on export surpluses, however, rendered China extremely vulnerable to external shocks \u2014 prompting a dramatic monetary and fiscal stimulus response to the crisis of 2008, even while sustaining the illusion of economic \u2018decoupling\u2019 from the global economy. Finally, it examines the growing role of the state in the current crisis-ridden economic model, as well as China\u2019s current geoeconomic and geopolitical expansionism in areas such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the militarisation of the East and South China Seas.

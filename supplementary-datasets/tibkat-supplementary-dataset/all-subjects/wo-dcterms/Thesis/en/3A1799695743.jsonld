            "abstract": [
                "Classical research on word recognition describes how when adult participants are presented&#13;with pairs of words that share phonemes or belong to the same semantic category, the&#13;processing of the second word is facilitated provided the first word is related to the second.&#13;These observations have suggested that words in the mental lexicon are connected via&#13;phonological and semantic links. However, more recently, these association rules have been&#13;found to evolve in children during the early phases of language acquisition, at the time in which&#13;their language processing skills are being developed together with a fast growth of the child\u2019s&#13;vocabulary.&#13;The present dissertation deals with the phenomena of facilitation and interference in word&#13;recognition due to phonological and semantic similarities during early childhood. It does so&#13;through three interrelated studies. In a longitudinal design, the first study investigated whether&#13;phonological and semantic priming would be better predicted either by the infants\u2019 vocabulary&#13;size or by their age. The second study investigated the impact of joint phonological and semantic&#13;similarities on word recognition. While past studies had investigated both factors separately,&#13;Study II investigated the impact of both factors in combination. The third and last study dived&#13;into the question of how word recognition is affected by the similarities among the novel words&#13;to learn. Therefore, the mechanisms of facilitation/interference of word recognition due to&#13;phonological and semantic overlap was again investigated in young children, but under&#13;controlled learning experimental protocol; comparing the effects of word overlap on recently&#13;acquired words.&#13;Overall, the results of this dissertation show that (i) word recognition is primarily modulated by&#13;the number of words in the mental lexicon of children, (ii) phonological interference of word&#13;recognition can be alleviated by introducing a semantic similarity, and (iii) that children&#13;recognise better recently acquired words when the novel words shared either phonological or&#13;semantic similarities. Result (i) provides the first evidence of the effect of children current&#13;vocabulary on phonological interference effects. These results align with models of spoken word&#13;recognition that suggest that during speech processing, phonologically related words are&#13;activated and compete for recognition in line with the Cohort Model and the Neighbourhood&#13;Activation Model; thus, the more words a child knows more related associates are activated. In&#13;addition, result (ii) shows that adding a similarity in meaning reduces the interference in target&#13;recognition induced by the phonological similarity between words. These results resonate with&#13;the Distributed Cohort Model, which suggests that semantic aspects of words reduce the&#13;activation of phonologically related words to the target supporting the recognition of the&#13;intended word. Finally, together the results of this dissertation highlight the differential impact&#13;of words simple vs. compound overlap on familiar and recently acquired words. Specifically, it&#13;was found that while simple phonological or semantic similarities interfered with familiar word&#13;recognition, simple similarities between novel words supported novel word recognition. These&#13;results support the hypothesis of the LEX model of word learning that predicts better learning&#13;of novel words of similar form or similar meaning than of words with similar form and meaning.$yLinzenz",

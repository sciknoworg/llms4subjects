            "abstract": "This dissertation introduces the self and affect regulation theory of adherence to social norms (SARTAN), addressing the need for specific, integrative explanations of criminal behavior grounded in basic psychological research. Rooted in Julius Kuhl\u2019s personality-systems-interactions (PSI) theory, SARTAN explains norm-relevant behavior as a result of the interaction between affect (positive and negative), its regulation, and internal and external controls. The theory identifies two primary modes of action regulation: the introjective mode, where intentions are formed based on external cues, and the self mode, guided by personal norm commitment. The affective state is assumed to determine the mode of action generation (i.e., introjective mode vs. self mode) in given situations. In four studies using offender samples, hypotheses and research methods derived from the theory were tested. Although support for specific hypotheses was mixed, the findings underscore the psychological significance of the distinction between positive and negative affect in norm-relevant behavior. The potential of PSI theory for criminal psychology is explored within the SARTAN frame and beyond. The empirical and theoretical work is discussed in terms of its implications for predicting criminal behavior and enhancing offender treatment. Its limitations are acknowledged both in terms of internal and external validity, and avenues for future research are outlined.",

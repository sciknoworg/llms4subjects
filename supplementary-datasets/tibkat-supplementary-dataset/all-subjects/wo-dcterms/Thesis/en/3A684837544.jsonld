            "title": "Optical analysis of synaptic vesicle protein molecules during exo- and endocytosis using pH-switchable fluorescent probes",
            "abstract": "At conventional synapses of the central nervous system (CNS), fast synaptic transmission is mediated by the release of neurotransmitters (NTs) upon Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis. Upon exocytosis SV proteins have to be resorted and retrieved from the surface by compensatory endocytosis in order to replenish the pool of NT-filled SVs. For my thesis I used pH-switchable dyes, both genetically encoded as well as new exogenous ones, for optically analysing SV protein molecules necessary for fusion as well as their retrieval. Exocytosis is mediated by the assembly of low-energy SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein complexes formed by the coil-coiling of three SNARE proteins: Synaptosomal associated protein - 25 (SNAP-25), Syntaxin 1A (Syx1A), and Synaptobrevin 2 (Syb2). However, it is unknown how many SNARE complexes are minimally needed for SV priming and fusion at CNS synapses. To resolve this issue, single vesicle fusion events were optically measured in real time using the genetically encoded probe SynaptopHluorin (SpH), a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP), pHluorin (pHl) fused to the luminal domain of the SV SNARE Syb2. Fluorescence responses upon fusion displayed a quantal distribution of SpH molecules into SVs. Quantitative single molecule experiments revealed that the quantal size corresponds to single SpH molecule fluorescence. Surprisingly, when overexpressed on a genetic null background, SpH could fully rescue evoked SV fusion. However, SVs expressing only one copy of SpH were unable to rapidly fuse upon stimulation. Taken together, the first part of the study demonstrates that two copies of SpH and hence two SNARE complexes are necessary and sufficient for SV fusion during fast synaptic transmission ...",

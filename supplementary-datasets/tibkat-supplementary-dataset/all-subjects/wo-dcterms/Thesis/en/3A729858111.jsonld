            "title": "Phosphate homeostasis and posttranscriptional gene regulation during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in Medicago truncatula",
            "abstract": "Since available phosphate (Pi) resources in soil are limited, symbiotic interactions between plant roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are a widespread strategy to improve plant phosphate nutrition. The repression of AM symbiosis by a high plant Pi-status indicates a link between Pi homeostasis signalling and AM symbiosis development. This assumption is supported by the systemic induction of several microRNA399 (miR399) primary transcripts in shoots and a simultaneous accumulation of mature miR399 in roots of mycorrhizal plants. However, the physiological role of this miR399 expression pattern is still elusive and offers the question whether other miRNAs are also involved in AM symbiosis. Therefore, a deep sequencing approach was applied to investigate miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional gene regulation in M. truncatula mycorrhizal roots. Degradome analysis revealed that 185 transcripts were cleaved by miRNAs, of which the majority encoded transcription factors and disease resistance genes, suggesting a tight control of transcriptional reprogramming and a downregulation of defence responses by several miRNAs in mycorrhizal roots. Interestingly, 45 of the miRNA-cleaved transcripts showed a significant differentially regulated between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots. In addition, key components of the Pi homeostasis signalling pathway were analyzed concerning their expression during AM symbiosis development. MtPhr1 overexpression and time course expression data suggested a strong interrelation between the components of the PHR1-miR399-PHO2 signalling pathway and AM symbiosis, predominantly during later stages of symbiosis. In situ hybridizations confirmed accumulation of mature miR399 in the phloem and in arbuscule-containing cortex cells of mycorrhizal roots. Moreover, a novel target of the miR399 family, named as MtPt8, was identified by the above mentioned degradome analysis. MtPt8 encodes a Pi-transporter exclusively transcribed in mycorrhizal roots and its promoter activity was restricted to arbuscule-containing cells. At a low Pi-status, MtPt8 transcript abundance inversely correlated with a mature miR399 expression pattern. Increased MtPt8 transcript levels were accompanied by elevated symbiotic Pi-uptake efficiency, indicating its impact on balancing plant and fungal Pi-acquisition. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a direct link of the regulatory mechanisms of plant Pi-homeostasis and AM symbiosis at a cell-specific level. The results of this study, especially the interaction of miR399 and MtPt8 provide a fundamental step for future studies of plant-microbe-interactions with regard to agricultural and ecological aspects.",

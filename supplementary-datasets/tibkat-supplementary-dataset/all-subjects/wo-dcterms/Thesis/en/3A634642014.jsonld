            "abstract": "Water-soluble organic compounds (WSOCs) are major components of atmospheric aerosols, accounting for ~50% or more of the organic fraction of particulate matter. They can influence the optical properties and hygroscopicity of aerosol particles and their effects on climate. Moreover, they can contribute to the toxicity and allergenicity of air particulate matter.rnIn this study, high performance liquid chromatography coupled with optical diode array detection and mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS and HPLC-MS/MS) has been applied to measure WSOCs with a wide range of molecular masses and structures that are characteristic for different aerosol types, sources, and processes. Carboxylic acids and nitrophenols with low molecular mass were investigated as tracers for fossil fuel combustion and the formation and aging of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from biogenic precursors. Protein macromolecules were investigated with regard to the influence of air pollution and nitration on the allergenicity of primary biological particles like pollen and fungal spores. rnFilter samples of fine and coarse aerosol particles collected over a period of one year in central Europe (Mainz, Germany) were analyzed for WSOCs, including the ?- and ?-pinene oxidation products (pinic acid, pinonic acid and 3-methyl\u01a0-1,2,3-\u01a0butane\u01a0tricarboxylic acid (3-MBTCA)) as well as a variety of dicarboxylic acids and nitrophenols. Seasonal variations and other characteristic features are discussed with regard to aerosol sources and sinks in comparison to data from other studies and regions. The ratios of adipic acid and phthalic acid to azelaic acid indicate that the investigated aerosol samples were mainly influenced by biogenic sources ...",

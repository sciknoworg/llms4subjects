            "abstract": "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), Pulsed spray evaporation (PSE), Ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), Sample transfer, Electron beam-induced deposition (EBID), Metal acetylacetonates, Metal thin film, Nickel, Cobalt, Water, XPS, SEM. - This PhD thesis aimed at contributing to the mechanistic understanding of the growth conditions of metallic films synthesized by the previously established technique of pulsed spray evaporation chemical vapor deposition (PSE-CVD). Nickel and cobalt were selected as an example to study links between the macroscopic deposition conditions and the microscopic processes involving the precursor, surface properties and the growing thin film. The present work addressed important features of the growth process including the influence of various CVD parameters on the growth kinetics, such as the nature of the metal centre, the temperature sensitivity of carbon contamination, the function of ethanol, both as a solvent as well as a catalytic agent, influence of nickel as a seed layer for different combinations of boundary conditions, the role of water on CVD of Ni and Co thin films from ethanol solutions. Furthermore, investigation of the mechanisms of PSE-CVD from acetylacetonate metal precursors in ethanol, as well as thermal and electron beam-induced decomposition of solvent-free layers of intact Co(acac)2 and Ni(acac)2 was performed.",

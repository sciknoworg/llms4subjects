            "abstract": "Estimating the value consumers place on farm animal welfare (FAW) provides information on the extent to which consumers are ready to support policy changes aim at improving the welfare of farm animals and developing animal-friendly production systems that can also compete on markets. The current study aimed at exploring consumer preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a certified FAW product, namely broiler meat, using the contingent valuation method. In addition, the study used the choice experiment method to investigate how consumers value different FAW attributes and alternative broiler production systems, including outdoor and extensive indoor systems. The data was obtained from a survey of 300 German broiler consumers using face-to-face interviews. The results of the contingent valuation showed that 82% of the respondents were ready to buy certified FAW products. A majority of these (95%) were willing to pay an extra sum of about \u20ac1.5 for 1 kg of FAW-certified\u02ba broiler fillets, which represents a price increase of about 27% in comparison with the actual price of conventional broiler fillets. The choice experiment findings revealed that consumers were more likely to pay significantly higher prices for alternatively produced broilers relative to the conventional product. In conclusion, both the contingent valuation and the choice experiment results confirm that there is a potential for raising the welfare standards of broilers in Germany. This suggests that policy changes towards high welfare levels are strongly supported by consumers and calls policy makers and the chicken industry to diversify broiler production methods and shift to more welfare-friendly methods.",

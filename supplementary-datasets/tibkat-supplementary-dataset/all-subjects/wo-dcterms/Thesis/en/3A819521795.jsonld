            "abstract": "The present thesis analyzes how ill-health affects developing communities in rural India and the way health insurance products can be developed and tailored to low-income individuals\u00b4 needs and limited financial possibilities. A community-based health insurance scheme implemented in three sites in two rural regions in northern India is used as case study for showing how bottom- up participatory methods can be applied in developing communities for the development of customized health insurance products, allowing even illiterate and inexperienced individuals to manifest their preferences for health insurance plans. This scheme is particularly developed around Self-Help Groups (SHGs), a well-established informal microcredit system involving women from developing communities. Next to community-based health insurance schemes, the role of commercial insurers in creating an inclusive insurance system for the low-income groups in India will be evaluated, given the growing relevance these actors are gaining within micro insurance activities.",

            "abstract": "Diagnosis of AKI in the early stages is challenging not only in human but also in veterinary medicine. The novel renal biomarker SDMA has been proven to be a sensitive indicator of changes of renal function with fewer extra-renal influence factors than creatinine in human and small animals. The diagnostic value of SDMA in horses is still unknown. Other than SDMA, RFA, urine reagent strips and microscopic examination of urine might also have value in predicting AKI. In the first study, the SDMA in horses with different dehydration levels was analyzed with RFA, creatinine and BUN. The SDMA had a moderate correlation with creatinine and association with the dehydrated status before infusion. There was no other significant correlation with the other parameters and the outcome of patients. Its reaction to rehydration therapy correlated with creatinine and the GGT/creatinine ratio, showed that it might eventually indicate the perfusion status of equine kidney. Although SDMA did not show that it had a predictive value of AKI and prognosis in this study, it is still worth investigating it further in horses under risk of AKI and finding out the role it plays in the renal pathology in horses. In the second study, parameters from RFA were estimated between different dehydration levels. The comparison between urine reagent strips and microscopic examination showed that the dipstick was not sensitive enough to detect any tiny early changes of renal function. No parameter besides creatinine had any significant association with the dehydration status. This showed that selected renal markers from RFA had no predictive value of AKI. Although primary renal disease is believed to be rare in horses, secondary AKI induced by hypovolemic dehydration, renal toxic medication and endotoxemia could affect the survival rate, cost and the need for intensive care of the hospitalized patients. A reliable diagnostic tool, either biomarkers or another test, such as urine output estimation, will be helpful to recognize changes in renal function ...",

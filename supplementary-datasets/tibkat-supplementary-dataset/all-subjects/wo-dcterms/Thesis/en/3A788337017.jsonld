            "title": "Passive biomimetic actuators : the role of material architecture",
            "abstract": "Passive plant actuators have fascinated many researchers in the field of botany and structural biology since at least one century. Up to date, the most investigated tissue types in plant and artificial passive actuators are fibre-reinforced composites (and multilayered assemblies thereof) where stiff, almost inextensible cellulose microfibrils direct the otherwise isotropic swelling of a matrix. In addition, Nature provides examples of actuating systems based on lignified, low-swelling, cellular solids enclosing a high-swelling cellulosic phase. This is the case of the Delosperma nakurense seed capsule, in which a specialized tissue promotes the reversible opening of the capsule upon wetting. This tissue has a diamond-shaped honeycomb microstructure characterized by high geometrical anisotropy: when the cellulosic phase swells inside this constraining structure, the tissue deforms up to four times in one principal direction while maintaining its original dimension in the other. Inspired by the example of the Delosoperma nakurense, in this thesis we analyze the role of architecture of 2D cellular solids as models for natural hygromorphs. To start off, we consider a simple fluid pressure acting in the cells and try to assess the influence of several architectural parameters onto their mechanical actuation. Since internal pressurization is a configurational type of load (that is the load direction is not fixed but it \u201cfollows\u201d the structure as it deforms) it will result in the cellular structure acquiring a \u201cspontaneous\u201d shape. This shape is independent of the load but just depends on the architectural characteristics of the cells making up the structure itself. Whereas regular convex tiled cellular solids (such as hexagonal, triangular or square lattices) deform isotropically upon pressurization, we show through finite element simulations that by introducing anisotropic and non-convex, reentrant tiling large expansions can be achieved in each individual cell. The influence of geometrical anisotropy onto the expansion behaviour of a diamond shaped honeycomb is assessed by FEM calculations and a Born lattice approximation. We found that anisotropic expansions (eigenstrains) comparable to those observed in the keels tissue of the Delosoperma nakurense are possible. In particular these depend on the relative contributions of bending and stretching of the beams building up the honeycomb. Moreover, by varying the walls\u2019 Young modulus E and internal pressure p we found that both the eigenstrains and 2D elastic moduli scale with the ratio p/E. Therefore the potential of these pressurized structures as soft actuators is outlined. This approach was extended by considering several 2D cellular solids based on two types of non-convex cells. Each honeycomb is build as a lattice made of only one non-convex cell. Compared to usual honeycombs, these lattices have kinked walls between neighbouring cells which offers a hidden length scale allowing large directed deformations. By comparing the area expansion in all lattices, we were able to show that less convex cells are prone to achieve larger area expansions, but the direction in which the material expands is variable and depends on the local cell\u2019s connectivity. This has repercussions both at the macroscopic (lattice level) and microscopic (cells level) scales. At the macroscopic scale, these non-convex lattices can experience large anisotropic (similarly to the diamond shaped honeycomb) or perfectly isotropic principal expansions, large shearing deformations or a mixed behaviour. Moreover, lattices that at the macroscopic scale expand similarly can show quite different microscopic deformation patterns that include zig-zag motions and radical changes of the initial cell shape. Depending on the lattice architecture, the microscopic deformations of the individual cells can be equal or not, so that they can build up or mutually compensate and hence give rise to the aforementioned variety of macroscopic behaviours. Interestingly, simple geometrical arguments involving the undeformed cell shape and its local connectivity enable to predict the results of the FE simulations. Motivated by the results of the simulations, we also created experimental 3D printed models of such actuating structures. When swollen, the models undergo substantial deformation with deformation patterns qualitatively following those predicted by the simulations. This work highlights how the internal architecture of a swellable cellular solid can lead to complex shape changes which may be useful in the fields of soft robotics or morphing structures.",

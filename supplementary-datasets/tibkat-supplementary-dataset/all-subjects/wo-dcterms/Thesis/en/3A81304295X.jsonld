            "abstract": "This research represents an effort made towards contribute to the critical thinking from an analysis of the hegemonic neoliberal ideology, which supports the idea of the end of history and the technocratic universalism which in turn implies the imposition of a single model of life, denying, in the name of realism and the end of utopias, any other alternative possibility. This makes it necessary to recover the critical thinking to analyze and understand the reality, thus overcoming the ideological barrier towards claiming that things can be otherwise. It is clear from this research that the discourse of sustainable development has unquestionably transformed the context and content of political activity in Europe. This discourse has exercised and obvious influence in the Governance processes, mainly because it has contributed to the introduction of a new political field, which was then promoted, either explicitly or implicitly by policy-makers, researchers on the field and practitioners during the last three decades. Though it may be bold to affirm that the discourse of sustainable development is the sole driver of these whole set of changes, there is no doubt that it has played a key part in the way in which the governance priorities have been handled in the European continent.",

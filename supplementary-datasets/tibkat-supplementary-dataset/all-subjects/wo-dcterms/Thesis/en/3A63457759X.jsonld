            "abstract": "The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides us with a wealth of information about the properties of our Universe. In this PhD work, we develop and apply new techniques for studying fundamental problems of cosmology using the CMB. Dark energy, if it exists, leaves a characteristic imprint in the CMB temperature fluctuations, the so-called integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. This small effect can be detected via its cross-correlation with the large-scale structure (LSS). We derive an optimal method for ISW detection using temperature and polarization data of the CMB which differs from that usually used in two fundamental ways: we keep the LSS distribution and a part of the primordial temperature fluctuations fixed, rather than averaging over different realisations as done in the standard method. For an ideal scenario, we obtain an overall enhancement of the detection significance of 23 per cent. For polarization data from the Planck Surveyor mission, this enhancement will be at least 10 per cent, where the limiting factor will be the contamination by Galactic foregrounds. The CMB is observed to be almost perfectly isotropic, which is considered strong evidence for the isotropy of the Universe. However, some anomalies have been found in the temperature map of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), which seem to question the statistical isotropy of the temperature fluctuations. In order to understand whether these are due to chance fluctuations or to a preferred direction intrinsic to the geometry of the primordial Universe, we compute the part of the WMAP polarization map which is uncorrelated with the temperature map, and use it as a statistically independent probe of the so-called axis of evil ...",

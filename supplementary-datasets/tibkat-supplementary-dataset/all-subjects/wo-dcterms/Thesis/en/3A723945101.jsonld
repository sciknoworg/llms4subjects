            "abstract": "Autophagy is a degradative pathway conserved in eukaryotes. During autophagy a portion of the cytoplasm is sequestered by a de novo forming isolation membrane resulting in the formation of a double membrane vesicle. This autophagosome vesicle then fuses with the vacuole, or lysosome in animals, where its content is degraded. The Atg12-Atg5~Atg16 complex localizes to the growing isolation membrane and is essential for autophagosome formation. The complex is oligomerized via the coiled coil domain of Atg16 and this oligomerization is required for the expansion step during autophagosome formation. In this study, the oligomerization state of Atg5~Atg16L1 complexes comprising various lengths of the coiled coil domain of Atg16L1 were investigated with multiple angle laser light scattering. The coiled coil domain homo-dimerizes Atg16L1, and this in turn causes two copies each of Atg5 and Atg16L1 to be present in the complex. Several interaction partners of Atg5 and Atg16 were also characterized. For example, Atg16L1(141-265) interacts with Rab33B in a GTP-dependent manner (Itoh 2008). In this study it was shown that residues 172-234 of Atg16L1 are sufficient for binding. Crystals of the Rab33B(30-202)Q92L~Atg16L1(141-265) complex were grown, however they did not diffract. Furthermore, I showed that calpain cleaves Atg16L1 but not Atg5. Cleavage of autophagy proteins by calpain could play a role in the regulation of autophagy ...",

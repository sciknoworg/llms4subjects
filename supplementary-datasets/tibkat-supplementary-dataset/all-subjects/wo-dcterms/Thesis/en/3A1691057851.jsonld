            "abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is planned to undergo a major upgrade, called the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), to fully exploit its physics potential until the end of its operation with an instantaneous luminosity of 5 to 7.5 times the design value (1*10^34 cm^(-2)s^(\u22121)). Consequently, the LHC experiments have to be upgraded as well (Phase-II upgrade) to be able to cope with the resulting increase in pile-up, data rates, and radiation doses. Therefore, the tracking detector of the ATLAS experiment, the Inner Detector, will be fully replaced by a new all-silicon tracking detector, the Inner Tracker (ITk). While it has been decided that only the baseline design of the pixel part of the ITk will be pursued, which foresees the use of hybrid pixel detectors, it has been worthwhile to study monolithic pixel sensor options as well, whose production is comparatively cost-efficient. Monolithic pixel sensors have recently made their way into particle physics experiments and they were considered as an alternative sensor option for the outermost pixel layer of the ITk. Within the scope of this thesis, a high voltage monolithic active pixel sensor (HV-MAPS) prototype, called ATLASPix_Simple, was characterized and studied regarding its suitability for the use in the ITk.",

            "abstract": "Plants perceive changes in their environment as cues to control and adjust their physiological responses accordingly to achieve fitness. Whether and how plants use such cues and orchestrate their defence responses against herbivores is still unclear. We addressed this question by studying the secretion of extrafloral nectar (EFN), an indirect defense mechanism against herbivory, which is regulated via the octadecanoid-signaling pathway. In lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), a temporal pattern in EFN secretion was observed: plants constitutively produced high amounts of EFN at night as compared to day. Depending on the light environment, jasmonic acid (JA) treatment had different effects on EFN secretion: induction during light phase and suppression during the dark phase. In contrast, relative to control plants treatment with the isoleucine-JA-conjugate (JA-Ile), increased EFN secretion in light phase, yet did not change the secretion rate under dark conditions. In light-exposed plants, inhibition of Ile biosynthesis significantly decreased the EFN secretion, corroborating the hypothesis that probably JA-Ile is the actual signal. Moreover, methyl jasmonate, a derivative of JA in which the free acid moiety is unavailable for conjugation to JA, did neither induce EFN production under light nor supressed EFN secretion in dark conditions. Alterations of the light spectral quality (measured as ratio of red (R) to far-red (FR) radiation) strongly affected EFN secretion: exposure to 10:90 R:FR increased EFN secretion by JA-Ile treatment but not with JA. When exposed to FR only, plants treated with both JA and JA-Ile reduced EFN secretion rate whereas at 50:50 R:FR ratio, both JA and JA-Ile induced EFN secretion. We conlcude that plants temporally orchestrate EFN secretion and this regulation of EFN secretion is mediated by JA-Ile biosynthesis.",

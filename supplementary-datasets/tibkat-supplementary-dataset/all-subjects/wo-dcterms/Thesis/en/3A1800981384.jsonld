            "abstract": "This work explores several ways in which the presence of dissolved ions in a liquid can drive the formation of ordered structures. Chapter I illustrates the importance of electrostatic effects in liquids, spanning a wide narrative arc from Coulomb's 18th century experiments, across the mechanics of curdling milk and up to the self-assembly of biological membranes. Any theoretical foundations used in more than one chapter of the thesis are laid out in chapter II. Chapters III-V lay out my core results obtained from numerical simulations of three different systems. \u2022 Chapter III presents hydrodynamic simulations of sedimenting, electrostatically interacting same-charge particles. The core question here is how the range of interparticle repulsion affects the sedimentation speed as a function of concentration. As the repulsion range increases, a transition from a random, gas-like particle distribution to a liquid-like arrangement coincides with a minimum in the slope of the sedimentation speed. Throughout a wide parameter range this slope of the sedimentation function can be described by a simple fit function with two parameters (the location and sharpness of the gas-liquid transition). This fit models short-range repulsion as an increased effective hard sphere radius, whereas sufficiently long-ranged repulsion leads to an ordered distribution of equidistant particles independent of the exact repulsion range. \u2022 Chapter IV is a study of the quenched demixing of oppositely charged liquids, combining lattice Boltzmann simulations with phase field model theory. The underlying aim here is to understand what determines the types of mesoscale structures formed by antagonistic salts in polar/nonpolar liquid mixtures. The model consists of two otherwise identical, by themselves immiscible, liquids coupled to positive and negative dissolved ions. Each ion type is preferentially solvated by a different liquid phase, leading to some degree of charge separation. Complex structure formation can occur when the solvation potential ...",

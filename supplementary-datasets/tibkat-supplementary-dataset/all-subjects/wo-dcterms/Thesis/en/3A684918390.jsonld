            "abstract": "The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is highly conserved throughout the evolution of mammals. (What does this sentence mean? What do you mean by ``conserved?\u0301\u0301 This protein was higly conserved during the evolution of mammals [pantera et al. 2009; Jiayu et al.2009] and the gene tree deduced from the PrP sequences largely agrees with the species tree, indicating that no major deviations occurred in the evolution of the prion gene in different placental lineages [Teun van Rheede et al. 2003].) However, the cellular function of this ubiquitous protein is still not clear. The accumulation of misfolded and aggregated forms of PrPC (known as PrPSc) causes transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. Despite increasing knowledge concerning the PrPSc, very little is known about the physiological characteristics of PrPC and its interaction with other cellular proteins. The present study was undertaken to identify proteins interacting with PrPC that could provide new insights into its physiological functions and pathological role. Human PrPC was expressed in prion protein-deficient murine hippocampus (HpL3-4) neuronal cells. The PrPC along with its interacting proteins were affinity purified using STrEP-Tactin chromatography, in-gel digested and then identified by Q-TOF MS/MS analysis. Forty three proteins appeared to interact with PrPC in this neuronal cell line. Of these, fifteen were already known for their interaction with PrPC or PrPSc, while twenty eight new proteins were identified ...",

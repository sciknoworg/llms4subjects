            "abstract": "Weld pool dynamics simulation, keyhole dynamics simulation, laser beam welding, welding distortion, ray tracing method. - Distortion is one of the drawbacks of any welding process, most of the time needed to be suppressed. One doubtful factor that could affect welding deformation is the shape of the liquid melt pool, which can be modified via variation of process parameters. The aim of this work was to numerically study the dynamics of the weld pool and its geometrical influence on welding distortion during laser beam welding. To achieve such a goal, a promising novel process simulation model, employed in investigating the keyhole and weld pool dynamics, has successfully been invented. The model incorporated all distinctive behaviours of the laser beam welding process. Moreover, identification of the correlation between the weld pool geometry and welding distortion as well as, eventually, weld pool shapes that favour distortion minimisation has also been simulatively demonstrated.",

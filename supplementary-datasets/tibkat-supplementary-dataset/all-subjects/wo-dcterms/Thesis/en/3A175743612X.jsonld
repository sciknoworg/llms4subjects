            "abstract": "Abstract: In this work, sterically demanding anionic pyridines were synthesized as a novel class of pyridines. For this purpose, a synthetic route was developed starting from 2,6-dimesitylpyridine (Mes2Py), which provides access to 4-BPh3Mes2PyH, its alkali metal salts and salts of the non coordinating cations [K(18-crown-6)]+ and [NEt4]+. In addition, the electronically modified derivative 4-B(ArCF3)3Mes2PyLi (ArCF3 = 3,5-(CF3)2Ph) was synthesized. The Br\u00f8nsted acidity of 4-BPh3Mes2PyH was determined in acetonitrile (pKa = 18.46) and showed that the introduction of the negatively charged group makes it one of the most basic pyridines known and thus a strong nucleophile, which was demonstrated by the cleavage reaction of THF in the presence of a Lewis acid. The basicity of 4-B(ArCF3)3Mes2PyH was found to be significantly lower (pKa (MeCN) = 16.44) which can be rationalized by the electron withdrawing effect of the CF3-groups at the triphenylborate function.<br>The described anionic pyridines were used as ligands for the synthesis of borane adducts. The reactions of 4-BPh3Mes2Py\u2022BH3Li with pyridine hydrochloride<br>and (MesNacNac)GeCl gave two compounds with formal boronium cations 4-BPh3Mes2Py\u2022BH2\u2022py and 4-BPh3Mes2Py\u2022BH2\u2022GeH(MesNacNac), respectively. In addition to their application as ligands, the two pyridines [4-BPh3Mes2Py]\u2212 and [4-B(ArCF3)3Mes2Py]\u2212 were identified as single electron donors (i.e. reducing agents). Addition of the uncoordinated anion [4-BPh3Mes2Py]\u2212 (or [4-B(ArCF3)3Mes2Py]\u2212) with [NEt4]+ as the counter ion to solutions of Au+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ lead to the deposition of the respective metals, while the anionic pyridine was recovered in its protonated form. Furthermore, the reaction of [4-BPh3Mes2Py]\u2212 with the trityl cation leads to the formation of the Gomberg dimer via a SET. It was rationalized that a neutral pyridine radical is formed during this process, which unselectively abstracts H-atoms from solvent molecules to yield 4-BPh3Mes2PyH. Eventually, this reactivity was identified as a Frustrated Lewis Pair / Frustrated Radical Pair mechanism and was successfully exploited in the catalytic dehydrogenative coupling reaction of R3SnH to yield R3SnSnR3.<br>Furthermore, in the course of this work, the first lithiated pyridine (pyridyllithium) 4-Li-2,6-dimesitylpyridine was isolated. Its aggregation was studied in solution and in the solid state and provided the first crystal structure of a lithiated azine",

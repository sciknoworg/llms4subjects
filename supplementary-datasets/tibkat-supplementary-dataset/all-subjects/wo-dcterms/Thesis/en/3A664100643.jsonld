            "abstract": "Plants differ widely in Cd accumulation when grown on Cd contaminated soils. This is because several soil properties interact with several plant properties. Plant factors determining the shoot Cd concentration of plants are the root-shoot ratio [surface area (RA) per unit of shoot dry weight (SDW)], the relative shoot growth rate (RGRS), the Cd total net influx (Int) and the proportion of absorbed Cd that is translocated from the root to the shoot (p). And the Cd influx is furthermore influenced by plant properties like the Cd uptake kinetics and the ability of the root to affect the Cd solubility in the rhizosphere. The aim of this research was to assess the significance of the above mentioned plant properties for the shoot Cd accumulation for different plant species. A growth chamber experiment was carried out with maize, sunflower, flax, and spinach growing on a sandy soil to which 0, 14 and 40 \u00e6mol Cd kg-1 were added resulting in a Cd soil solution concentration of 0.04, 0.68 and 2.51 \u00e6mol L-1. At the high Cd addition (40 \u00e6mol kg-1) SDW of flax and spinach was significantly decreased by 20% and 40%, respectively while maize and sunflower showed no yield depression ...",

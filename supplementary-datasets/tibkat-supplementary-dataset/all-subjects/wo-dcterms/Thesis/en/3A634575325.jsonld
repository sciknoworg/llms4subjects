            "abstract": "In this dissertation we consider several astrophysical phenomena. We reveal the nature of progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), derive constraints on progenitors of Classical Novae, and investigate the origin and properties of the unresolved X-ray emission in Andromeda galaxy (M31). Type Ia Supernovae, used as standards candles, played a major role in establishing that the Universe undergoes an accelerated expansion, the fact that directly pointed at the existence of dark energy. Although there is a general agreement that SNe Ia originate from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars, the nature of their progenitors is still debated. The nuclear runaway could arise from a white dwarf gradually accumulating matter from a companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit, or from two white dwarfs merging in a compact binary. The X-ray signatures of the two possible paths are completely different. Whereas no strong electromagnetic emission is expected in the merger scenario until shortly before the supernova, the white dwarf accreting material from the normal star becomes a source of copious X-rays for about 107 years before the explosion. This offers a means to determine which scenario dominates. We demonstrated that the X-ray flux from a sample of six early-type galaxies is factor of about 30 - 50 times less than predicted in the accretion scenario. Therefore at most 5 per cent of SNe Ia in early-type galaxies can be produced by accreting white dwarfs ...",

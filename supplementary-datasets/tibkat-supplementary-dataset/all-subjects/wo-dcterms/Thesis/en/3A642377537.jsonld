            "abstract": "Fluid mud, lutocline, suspended sediment, turbidity maximum zone, Ems estuary, ADCP. - Fluid mud is a highly concentrated suspension of fine-grained cohesive sediment, which often occurs in estuarine turbidity maximum zones (ETMZs) throughout the world. As an interface between the sea and inland, the estuarine zone is considered to be an ideal location for trade and thus ports are constructed in the estuarine zone. The occurrence of fluid mud is problematic as it might restrain navigability. Besides, cohesive sediments like mud particles are known to be the main carrier of pollutants as they specifically absorb contaminants from the water. Thus the management of estuarine and harbour fluid mud is a matter of considerable importance in the practice of hydraulic and environmental engineering. Current fluid mud models which are being used as a tool for making predictions require substantial site-specific validation to observations, and often give disappointing results due to an insufficient knowledge of underlying biogeochemical and physical mechanisms governing fluid mud dynamics. Detailed in situ measurements of fluid mud with high temporal and spatial resolution remain lacking due to laborious and costly measuring campaigns. In this study fluid mud dynamics in ETMZs were investigated by application of a numerical model and based on data of two field measurement campaigns. The numerical modelling study had been based on data from an early field survey in the Weser estuary. The entrainment of fluid mud deposited in dune troughs was studied in a series of scenario simulations and the suitability of entrainment formulae implemented in the model has been examined. The numerical model has been shown to simulate the entrainment of fluid mud layer from the dune troughs at peak tidal currents and reformation at slack waters, which were observed in early field surveys. It was concluded that a further development of the numerical fluid mud model cannot be independent of field measurements. In order to gain more insights into associated ...",

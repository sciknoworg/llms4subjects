            "abstract": "The phenolic compounds as food components represent the largest group of secondary metabolites in plant foods. The phenolic compounds, e.g. chlorogenic acid (CQA), are susceptible to oxidation by enzymes specially, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and at alkaline conditions. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidations occur in the presence of oxygen and produce quinone, which normally further react with other quinone to produce colored compounds (dimers), as well as is capable of undergoing a nucleophilic addition to proteins. The interactions of proteins with the phenolic compounds have received considerable attention in the recent years where, plant phenolic compounds have drawn increasing attention due to their antioxidant properties and their noticeable effects in the prevention of various oxidative stress associated diseases. Green coffee beans are one of the richest sources of chlorogenic acids. Therefore, a green coffee extract would provide an eligible food relevant source for phenolic compounds for modification of proteins. The interaction between 5-CQA and amino acid lysine showed decrease in both free CQA and amino acid groups and only a slight effect on the antioxidative capacity depending on the reaction time was found. Furthermore, this interaction showed a large number of intermediary substances of low intensities. The reaction of lysine with 5-CQA in a model system initially leads to formation of 3-CQA and 4-CQA (both are isomers of 5-CQA), oxidation giving rise to the formation of a dimer which subsequently forms an adduct with lysine to finally result in a benzacridine derivative as reported and confirmed with the aid of HPLC coupled with ESI-MSn. The benzacridine derivative containing a trihydroxy structural element, was found to be yellow, being very reactive with oxygen yielding semiquinone and quinone type of products with characteristic green colors. Finally, the optimal conditions for this interaction as assessed by both the loss of CQA and free amino groups of lysine can be given at pH 7 and 25\u00b0C, the interaction increasing with incubation time and depending also on the amount of tyrosinase present. Green coffee bean has a higher diversity and content of phenolics, where besides the CQA isomers and their esters, other conjugates like feruloylquinic acids were also identified, thus documenting differences in phenolic profiles for the two coffee types (Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta). Coffee proteins are modified by interactions with phenolic compounds during the extraction, where those from C. arabica are more susceptible to these interactions compared to C. robusta, and the polyphenol oxidase activity seems to be a crucial factor for the formation of these addition products. Moreover, In-gel digestion combined with MALDI-TOF-MS revealed that the most reactive and susceptible protein fractions to covalent reactions are the \u03b1-chains of the 11S storage protein. Thus, based on these results and those supplied by other research groups, a tentative list of possible adduct structures was derived. The diversity of the different CQA derivatives present in green coffee beans complicates the series of reactions occurring, providing a broad palette of reaction products. These interactions influence the properties of protein, where they exposed changes in the solubility and hydrophobicity of proteins compared to faba bean proteins (as control). Modification of milk whey protein products (primarily b-lactoglobulin) with coffee specific phenolics and commercial CQA under enzymatic and alkaline conditions seems to be affecting their chemical, structural and functional properties, where both modifications led to reduced free amino-,thiol groups and tryptophan content. We propose that the disulfide-thiol exchange in the C-terminus of b-lactoglobulin may be initiated by the redox conditions provided in the presence of CQA. The protein structure b-lactoglobulin thereupon becomes more disordered as simulated by molecular dynamic calculation. This unfolding process may additionally be supported by the reaction of the CQA at the proposed sites of modification of \uf065-amino groups of lysine (K77, K91, K138, K47) and the thiol group of cysteine (C121). These covalent modifications also decreased the solubility and hydrophobicity of b-lactoglobulin, moreover they provide modified protein samples with a high antioxidative power, thermally more stable as reflected by a higher Td, require less amount of energy to unfold and when emulsified with lutein esters, exhibit their higher stability against UV light. The MALDI-TOF and SDS-PAGE results revealed that proteins treated at alkaline conditions were more strongly modified than those treated under enzymatic conditions. Finally, the results showed a slight change in emulsifying properties of modified proteins",

            "abstract": "In the work presented different approaches for a theoretical description of the atmosphere of brown dwarfs are investigated. For this purpose the theory of stellar atmospheres is used for these substellar objects. It will be shown that this classical ansatz must be highly modified for the substellar use. In addition, two different approaches for the convective energy transport are incorporated in this study. A comparison is carried out between these two approximations. It will be shown that both approaches are behaving in physically plausible way and that one of this approximations can lay the basis for consistent incorporation of a set of diffusion equations.Furthermore, consistent model calculations were performed within this theoretical framework. These calculations combine monochromatic radiative transfer for newly derived molecule opacity sampling data with hydrostatical and chemical equilibrium. Some aspects of these model approaches are in this field of study the most promising and far-reaching attempts for a consistent description of substellar atmospheres...",

The capacity of reef organisms and ecosystems to adapt to such variable environments in terms of functions and services is a current topic in coral reef research, yet related knowledge, especially on the ecosystem level, is scarce. Marginal reefs that thrive in highly fluctuating or limiting environments, such as upwelling systems, provide natural laboratories to study the acclimatization and adaptation potential of reef organisms. This thesis aimed to contribute to the understanding of coral reef functioning in variable environments by investigating the impact of the Papagayo upwelling at the northern Pacific coast of Costa Rica. A series of interconnected studies was conducted in upwelling exposed reefs at weekly intervals over an entire observation year (April 2013 - April 2014). These studies monitored (i) a range of inorganic and organic water parameters, (ii) in situ primary production rates, (iii) benthic and herbivore community composition, and (iv) responses of algal and invertebrate settlement to simulated overfishing. Upwelling events between February and April 2014 decreased water temperatures by 7 - 9 \u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00b0C for several hours or days, while inorganic nutrient concentrations increased 3 - 16-fold. Sequentially, organic matter concentrations in the water column above the reef doubled and remained elevated for 2 - 3 months (Chapter 2). Surprisingly, the strong seasonality in environmental conditions did not significantly influence benthic community productivity or ...",

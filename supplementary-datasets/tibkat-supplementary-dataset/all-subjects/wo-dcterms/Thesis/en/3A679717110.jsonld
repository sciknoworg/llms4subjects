            "abstract": "The question of how single cells swim is of primary medical importance - especially in the case of pathogenic parasites. Biochemical and cell biological studies have helped elucidate many of the protein building blocks, and chemical interactions involved in motility. However, a complete understanding of microswimmers necessitates a physical and quantitative understanding of swimming mechanisms. In this context, the motility of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei is characterized in biomimetic environments. Trypanosomes, unicellular parasites, cause deadly diseases in humans and cattle in Africa and South America. They are transferred to a mammalian host through an insect vector and thrive within the blood stream and eventually invade the central nervous system. The parasite propels itself through these diverse environments with the aid of a flagellum. In a minimal homogeneous nutrient rich environment, cells exhibit one of three motility modes distinguishable by their directional persistence. Directional cells take on a straighter shape, while cells that exhibit little net displacement appear more bent. Ascribing the cell body to a worm like chain, we use the cell end to end distance (from base to tip) as a measure of cell stiffness and find that the elongated shape associated with higher directionality is also correlated with higher stiffness. Cell trajectories show a persistence in average swimming direction on the order of 15 s. Further, correlation analysis using high speed microscopy data of 1 kHz uncovered an additional relaxation time arising from strong body distortions in the range of 20 to 100 ms. Random walk models are formulated to describe the motility modes as well as the fast distortions of the cell body. In polymer networks and more viscous environments such as those found in the extracellular matrix, trypanosomes swimming speed is reduced ...",

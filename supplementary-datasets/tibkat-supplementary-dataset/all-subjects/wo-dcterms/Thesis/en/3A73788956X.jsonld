            "abstract": "The global financial crisis, which started in spring 2007 and escalated in September 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, began to affect the real economy in the fourth quarter of 2008. The German government at the time expected that gross domestic product (GDP) would shrink in 2009 by 6 per cent \u2013 more than at any time since World War II (finally, Germany\u00b4s GDP shrank by 4.9 per cent). Economists gave two different explanations for this dramatic development. One camp laid the blame with central banks, which had created too much liquidity during the two decades before the crisis, leading to price bubbles on the American housing market. Others argue that weak regulation and the liberalization of financial markets were responsible. Against that backdrop the idea was born to not simply conduct a technical analysis to find out which of those two explanations was more plausible. Instead there would be an analysis into whether these two diverging arguments of economists can be explained by the history of ideas. It seemed necessary to deal with the history of ideas in social philosophy, the role of government in the economy and the nature of money and interest as reflected in the main economic writings of the 20th century. The question is whether there is a connection in the writings of economists and political philosophers between the more general ideas about economics and society on the one hand and monetary policy on the other. The challenge of this thesis is to find an answer to this question by comparing the literature written by different monetary theorists and political philosophers, who \u2013 despite differences in details \u2013 claim to be \u201cliberal\u201d (the word \u201cliberal in this thesis is used in its original sense which means basically business friendly and in favour of free markets). The thesis presented analysis the writings of five important political and economic philosophers: Friedrich August von Hayek who presents the Austrian School of Economics, Walter Eucken who presents the German Freiburg School of Ordnungsoekonomik, Joseph A. Schumpter who presents a theory of the entrepreneur, Milton Friedman who is regarded as the founder of Monetarism and John Maynard Keynes who advocates an expansive monetary and fiscal policy to create jobs in the economy. Through this comparison there will be a connection of the thinking regarding broader ideas about political philosophy, the goals of economic policy and the instruments of monetary policy. The result: Individualistic ideas about a society coincide with preferences for small government and a high, sometimes fully decoupling of monetary policy from political influence. Conversely, ideas that follow less what is called \u201cnegative liberty\u201d and more what is regarded as \u201cpositive liberty,\u201d and emphasize the economic success of the society instead of individual freedom, go along with ideas of big government in the economic process of coordination and allocation. They ask for an active role of monetary policy to steer the economic process of a society, too. This leads to the following conclusion: The demand for an expansive monetary policy to stimulate business activity and economic growth descends \u2013 at least from the view of the history of ideas \u2013 not only from technical considerations about efficiency, but also from fundamentally more collectivistic \u2013 partly socialist \u2013 fundamental convictions. In other words, the argument for or against a monetary policy that stimulates economic activity is not only derived from theoretical economic models that can be verified or falsified by empirical methods. It starts with basic normative convictions about the value of individual freedom or the protection of property rights. However, this aspect gets scant notice in the current political and scientific economic discussion.",

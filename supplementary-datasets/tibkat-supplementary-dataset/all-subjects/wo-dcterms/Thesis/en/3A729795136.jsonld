            "abstract": "In this work new fluorinated and non-fluorinated mono- and bifunctional trithiocarbonates of the structure Z-C(=S)-S-R and Z-C(=S)-S-R-S-C(=S)-Z were synthesized for the use as chain transfer agents (CTAs) in the RAFT-process. All newly synthesized CTAs were tested for their efficiency to moderate the free radical polymerization process by polymerizing styrene (M3). Besides characterization of the homopolymers by GPC measurements, end- group analysis of the synthesized block copolymers via 1H-, 19F-NMR, and in some cases also UV-vis spectroscopy, were performed attaching suitable fluorinated moieties to the Z- and/or R-groups of the CTAs. Symmetric triblock copolymers of type BAB and non-symmetric fluorine end- capped polymers were accessible using the RAFT process in just two or one polymerization step. In particular, the RAFT-process enabled the controlled polymerization of hydrophilic monomers such as N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) (M1) as well as N-acryloylpyrrolidine (NAP) (M2) for the A-blocks and of the hydrophobic monomers styrene (M3), 2-fluorostyrene (M4), 3-fluorostyrene (M5), 4-fluorostyrene (M6) and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorostyrene (M7) for the B-blocks. The properties of the BAB-triblock copolymers were investigated in dilute, concentrated and highly concentrated aqueous solutions using DLS, turbidimetry, 1H- and 19F-NMR, rheology, determination of the CMC, foam height- and surface tension measurements and microscopy. Furthermore, their ability to stabilize emulsions and microemulsions and the wetting behaviour of their aqueous solutions on different substrates was investigated. The behaviour of the fluorine end-functionalized polymers to form micelles was studied applying DLS measurements in diluted organic solution. All investigated BAB-triblock copolymers were able to form micelles and show surface activity at room temperature in dilute aqueous solution. The aqueous solutions displayed moderate foam formation. With different types and concentrations of oils, the formation of emulsions could be detected using a light microscope. A boosting effect in microemulsions could not be found adding BAB-triblock copolymers. At elevated polymer concentrations, the formation of hydrogels was proved applying rheology measurements.",

            "abstract": "The dissertation contains three independent essays on the application of cooperative game theory on the international natural gas trade. The international natural gas network is represented by a stylized disaggregated quantitative model consisting of its major producers, customers, trunk-pipelines and LNG terminals. The value function considers essential characteristics of the international gas trade and characterizes the interdependencies between the major actors. The game is solved with the Shapley value and the nucleolus as alternative indexes for capturing the power of different players. Chapter 1 aims to rationalize players'' interest in the three pipeline projects, i.e., Nord Stream, South Stream, and Nabucco. The chapter relates the investments into the new pipelines to their impact on the power structure and thereby makes conclusions about the explanatory power of the solution concepts. While the Shapley value can explain the recent investments in the new pipelines as a rational attempt to alter the power structure in the network, the nucleolus, in contrast, fails to replicate the empirical evidence. Chapter 2 studies pipeline options of the Central Asian countries aimed at diversifying their transit routes and export markets. The results explain the Central Asian countries'' endorsement for an eastbound pipeline to China rather than a Europe-bound option, and show negligible demand competition between China and Europe for Central Asian supplies. Chapter 3 investigates major supply and demand developments in the global LNG market as well as their impact on the power structure in the Eurasian natural gas trade. The developments benefit European consumers significantly, but barely curtail the power of the established suppliers in close proximity to Europe, such as Russia.",

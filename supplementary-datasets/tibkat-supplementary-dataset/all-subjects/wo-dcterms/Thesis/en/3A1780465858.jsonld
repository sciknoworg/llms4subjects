            "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been intensively investigated in a wide range of studies as a result of its many unique features, which lead to its use in applications such as photocatalysis and (photo)electrochemistry. Mostly, TiO2 in the form of nanoparticles has been used, but recently, self-organized TiO2 nanotube layers obtained by an anodization process have been considerably studied as these (one-dimensional structures) provide advantages for electron transport and delivery. In photoelectrochemistry applications, particularly geometrically tunable and directional charge transport properties are essential for achieving high-efficiency photocatalysts. In this thesis, the latest technologies of anodic TiO2 nanotubes in terms of anodization and (photo)electrochemical applications are discussed in the introduction section. Then, the formation characteristics of TiO2 nanotubes are described, and examples of applications are presented. In order to form such TiO2 nanotubes, Ti foils were anodized in an organic-based electrolyte containing lactic acid. Here it is shown how to combine certain anodization parameters to achieve a specific nanotube morphology (i.e. single- and double-walled as well as tube-in-tube configurations). In addition, the morphology, chemical composition and properties of the grown and annealed nanotube layers are characterized. Usually, TiO2 nanotubes with a double-walled shape consisting of inner and outer shell are obtained with the classic anodization conditions. Single-walled nanotubes with enhanced properties can be obtained by removing the low quality inner-shell by an optimized chemical etching. In addition, when classic double-walled tubes are grown at low electrolyte temperatures, it results in a thick inner-shell, that after optimal annealing at 450 oC, can form a unique tube-in-tube shape (annealing in air at 450 oC). This nanostructured TiO2 shows a high potential for a wide range of applications, and their properties are determined mainly on surface-related processes. Therefore, for ...",

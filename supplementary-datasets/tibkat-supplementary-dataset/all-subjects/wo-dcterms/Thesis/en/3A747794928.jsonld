            "title": "Electron kinetic processes in the solar corona and wind",
            "abstract": "The Sun is surrounded by a 10^6 K hot atmosphere, the corona. The corona and the solar wind are fully ionized, and therefore in the plasma state. Magnetic fields play an important role in a plasma, since they bind electrically charged particles to their field lines. EUV spectroscopes, like the SUMER instrument on-board the SOHO spacecraft, reveal a preferred heating of coronal ions and strong temperature anisotropies. Velocity distributions of electrons can be measured directly in the solar wind, e.g. with the 3DPlasma instrument on-board the WIND satellite. They show a thermal core, an anisotropic suprathermal halo, and an anti-solar, magnetic-field-aligned, beam or \"strahl\".For an understanding of the physical processes in the corona, an adequate description of the plasma is needed. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) treats the plasma simply as an electrically conductive fluid. Multi-fluid models consider e.g. protons and electrons as separate fluids. They enable a description of many macroscopic plasma processes. However, fluid models are based on the assumption of a plasma near thermodynamic equilibrium. But the solar corona is far away from this. Furthermore, fluid models cannot describe processes like the interaction with electromagnetic waves on a microscopic scale.Kinetic models, which are based on particle velocity distributions, do not show these limitations, and are therefore well-suited for an explanation of the observations listed above. For the simplest kinetic models, the mirror force in the interplanetary magnetic field focuses solar wind electrons into an extremely narrow beam, which is contradicted by observations. Therefore, a scattering mechanism must exist that counteracts the mirror force. In this thesis, a kinetic model for electrons in the solar corona and wind is presented that provides electron scattering by resonant interaction with whistler waves. The kinetic model reproduces the observed components of solar wind electron distributions, i.e. core, halo, and a \"strahl\" with finite width. But the model is not only applicable on the quiet Sun. The propagation of energetic electrons from a solar flare is studied, and it is found that scattering in the direction of propagation and energy diffusion influence the arrival times of flare electrons at Earth approximately to the same degree. In the corona, the interaction of electrons with whistler waves does not only lead to scattering, but also to the formation of a suprathermal halo, as it is observed in interplanetary space. This effect is studied both for the solar wind as well as the closed volume of a coronal magnetic loop. The result is of fundamental importance for solar-stellar relations. The quiet solar corona always produces suprathermal electrons. This process is closely related to coronal heating, and can therefore be expected in any hot stellar corona. In the second part of this thesis it is detailed how to calculate growth or damping rates of plasma waves from electron velocity distributions. The emission and propagation of electron cyclotron waves in the quiet solar corona, and that of whistler waves during solar flares, is studied. The latter can be observed as so-called fiber bursts in dynamic radio spectra, and the results are in good agreement with observed bursts.",

            "abstract": "In this work the mass loss of stars is investigated with special focus on those populating the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram characterised by high luminosities and low effective temperatures. On the AGB stars with low- and intermediate initial mass are in their late stage of evolution. This phase is characterised by instabilities leading to stellar pulsations as observed in long-period variables or Mira stars. Furthermore, this phase is connected to strong mass-loss of up to ~10^{-4} M_{sun} yr^{-1}. By means of their mass loss, these stars contribute enormously to the enrichment of the interstellar matter with material processed through nuclear burning reactions and dust. Therefore, AGB stars are not only interesting as objects of stellar evolution but also in terms of galactic chemical evolution. In the atmosphere of an AGB star, the existence of dust has an immense influence on its physics and chemistry. Once dust is formed, it plays an important role as driving-mechanism of the mass loss, because its absorption cross section is by far larger than that of the (molecular) gas. Due to the pulsation the stellar atmosphere is levitated leading to favourable conditions for dust formation. The radiation pressure on the formed dust grains and the frictional coupling between the dust and surrounding gas accelerates the material outwards and results in a substantial stellar mass loss. In this work we theoretically investigate mass loss resulting from stellar evolution simulation in combination with a mass-loss description ...",

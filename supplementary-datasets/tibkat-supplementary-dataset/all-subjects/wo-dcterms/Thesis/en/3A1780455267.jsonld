            "abstract": "This work covers a wide field of studies into different areas of model complexes with biomimetic properties. Especially the use of stopped-flow techniques to accurately determine true catalytic properties of SODm compounds has been a focus throughout the scientific articles published. The Mn-pyane complex is a well-established mimic of SOD and has been modified at the distal pyridine position to introduce small functions to fine tune metal-centered redox potentials (figure 40). The synthesis and crystallographic data resemble tools for future investigations on metal-centered electron density influencing reactivity and mechanistic details in the disproportionation reaction catalyzed by these complexes. Fig. 40: Representation of the [Mn(pyane)(Cl)2] synthesis, introducing -Cl, -CH2NH2, -CF3, -OMe moieties.269 Synthetic fine tuning lead to a -CH2NH2 derivative pure enough to open the synthetic accessability to a selenium-based double mimetic of both SOD and GPx (figure 41). Fig. 41: Schematic representation of final step combination of [Mn(CH2NH2-pyane)(Cl)2] and NHS-modified Ebselen.270 Summary 52 Catalytic SOD-activity was shown to be unimpaired by the introduction of the modified Ebselen structure, providing a one-molecule GPx-SOD-mimic with spatial separated, substrate specific active sites for superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The influence of positive charge localized at the ligand near the metal coordination site has been studied extensively for the highly charged porphyrin complexes in figure 42. Fig. 42: Structures of highly charged metallo-porphyrins. Graphic from FRANKE et al.271 The differences for the MnIII and FeIII complexes in regard to acidity of coordinated water, influence of charge on the metal-centered redox potential, kinetic labilities of waterexchange in respect to positive charge, and the importance of charge proximity versus overall sum of charge have been highlighted. SOD activity studies have been performed for the complexes illustrated in figure 43, where the ligand system of the ...",

            "title": "Thin liquid films with nanoparticles and rod-like ions as models for nanofluidics",
            "abstract": "With the rise of nanotechnology in the last decade, nanofluidics has been established as a research field and gained increased interest in science and industry. Natural aqueous nanofluidic systems are very complex, there is often a predominance of liquid interfaces or the fluid contains charged or differently shaped colloids. The effects, promoted by these additives, are far from being completely understood and interesting questions arise with regards to the confinement of such complex fluidic systems. A systematic study of nanofluidic processes requires designing suitable experimental model nano \u2013 channels with required characteristics. The present work employed thin liquid films (TLFs) as experimental models. They have proven to be useful experimental tools because of their simple geometry, reproducible preparation, and controllable liquid interfaces. The thickness of the channels can be adjusted easily by the concentration of electrolyte in the film forming solution. This way, channel dimensions from 5 \u2013 100 nm are possible, a high flexibility for an experimental system. TLFs have liquid IFs of different charge and properties and they offer the possibility to confine differently shaped ions and molecules to very small spaces, or to subject them to controlled forces. This makes the foam films a unique \u201cdevice\u201d available to obtain information about fluidic systems in nanometer dimensions. The main goal of this thesis was to study nanofluidic processes using TLFs as models, or tools, and to subtract information about natural systems plus deepen the understanding on physical chemical conditions. The presented work showed that foam films can be used as experimental models to understand the behavior of liquids in nano \u2013 sized confinement. In the first part of the thesis, we studied the process of thinning of thin liquid films stabilized with the non \u2013 ionic surfactant n \u2013 dodecyl \u2013 \u00df \u2013 maltoside (\u00df \u2013 C12G2) with primary interest in interfacial diffusion processes during the thinning process dependent on surfactant concentration 64. The surfactant concentration in the film forming solutions was varied at constant electrolyte (NaCl) concentration. The velocity of thinning was analyzed combining previously developed theoretical approaches. Qualitative information about the mobility of the surfactant molecules at the film surfaces was obtained. We found that above a certain limiting surfactant concentration the film surfaces were completely immobile and they behaved as non \u2013 deformable, which decelerated the thinning process. This follows the predictions for Reynolds flow of liquid between two non \u2013 deformable disks. In the second part of the thesis, we designed a TLF nanofluidic system containing rod \u2013 like multivalent ions and compared this system to films containing monovalent ions. We presented first results which recognized for the first time the existence of an additional attractive force in the foam films based on the electrostatic interaction between rod \u2013 like ions and oppositely charged surfaces. We may speculate that this is an ion bridging component of the disjoining pressure. The results show that for films prepared in presence of spermidine the transformation of the thicker CF to the thinnest NBF is more probable as films prepared with NaCl at similar conditions of electrostatic interaction. This effect is not a result of specific adsorption of any of the ions at the fluid surfaces and it does not lead to any changes in the equilibrium properties of the CF and NBF. Our hypothesis was proven using the trivalent ion Y3+ which does not show ion bridging. The experimental results are compared to theoretical predictions and a quantitative agreement on the system\u2019s energy gain for the change from CF to NBF could be obtained. In the third part of the work, the behavior of nanoparticles in confinement was investigated with respect to their impact on the fluid flow velocity. The particles altered the flow velocity by an unexpected high amount, so that the resulting changes in the dynamic viscosity could not be explained by a realistic change of the fluid viscosity. Only aggregation, flocculation and plug formation can explain the experimental results. The particle systems in the presented thesis had a great impact on the film interfaces due to the stabilizer molecules present in the bulk solution. Finally, the location of the particles with respect to their lateral and vertical arrangement in the film was studied with advanced reflectivity and scattering methods. Neutron Reflectometry studies were performed to investigate the location of nanoparticles in the TLF perpendicular to the IF. For the first time, we study TLFs using grazing incidence small angle X \u2013 ray scattering (GISAXS), which is a technique sensitive to the lateral arrangement of particles in confined volumes. This work provides preliminary data on a lateral ordering of particles in the film.",

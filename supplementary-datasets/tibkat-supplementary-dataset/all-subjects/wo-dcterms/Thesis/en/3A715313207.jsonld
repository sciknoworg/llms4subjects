            "abstract": "The genus Verticillium includes many plant pathogenic species that cause serious economic losses through the infection of host plants, and it belong to one of the most widespread groups of plant pathogens in the world. Molecular studies on pathogenicity-related genes provides the opportunity for a better understanding of the disease caused by the fungus and thereby help in finding new strategies for the prevention or the control of infection. This thesis mainly focuses on the results of analysis of two genes detected in the genome of Verticillium longisporum putatively involved in the pathogenic life-cycle of the fungus while infecting natural host plant Brassica napus. During the research for this thesis, many candidate genes of V. longisporum were efficiently silenced by RNA interference (RNAi), triggered by the intracellular expression of hairpin (HP) cassettes. We tested different approaches published in recent years for the construction of HP fragments by PCR based methods. All these methods utilize Overlap extension-PCR (OE-PCR) to assemble sense and antisense strands of a candidate gene with an intervening spacer, and do not depend on time-consuming restriction enzyme-based cloning steps or require costly consumables ...",

            "abstract": "CVD, PVD, plasma jet, diamond coating. - In the fields of mechanics, optics and electronics a variety of materials can be replaced or be improved by diamond coatings in order to achieve higher durability\u00e2 s of the components. Especially in the area of mechanics, it is an advantage to coat materials without a process chamber. To take this fact into account, the aim of this work was to develop a process which makes it possible to grow diamond coatings without a process chamber. For this purpose two techniques, which are based on the CVD and PVD principle, have been developed and combined to form one process. The high power density of a laser based plasma jet was used to vaporize materials whilst ensuring at the same time that the process parameters for the chemical growth of diamond are retained. The analysis and the modeling of the processes make it possible to achieve a high reproducibility of diamond coatings as it was not yet possible with laser-based process-es. Especially the use of optical and electrical characterization techniques made it possible to set up an analytical model to describe the applicability of this method.",

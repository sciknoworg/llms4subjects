            "abstract": [
                "The MAIUS-1 payload is a high precision quantum optics experiment about to fly on a VSB-30 sounding rocket with the scientific objective to demonstrate the feasibility of creating the first Bose-Einstein condensates and performing atom interferometry in Space. To achieve these goals the experiment is using various sensitive instruments imposing strong requirements on the thermal and mechanical design. In the introduction this thesis gives a short overview and characterization of available microgravity platforms in Europe. Moreover a detailed characterization of the environment aboard the VSB-30 sounding rocket is presented based on flight data from former MASER and TEXUS missions. In the main chapters the mechanical and thermal design of the MAIUS-1 scientific payload is described in detail. This includes various technical solutions as for example a low-cost vibration isolation, a sealing for RADAX hull segments of pressurized payloads or umbilicals to provide water cooling until lift-off. In addition the test methods and results for the different payload components is presented. The design and test of the ultra-high vacuum system with a nominal pressure of 1E-10 hPa is described in a dedicated chapter. This includes theoretical background on outgassing of technical surfaces and calculation of the conductance of a vacuum system. Different pumping and sealing techniques are introduced. Furthermore the results of intensive testing of Conflat (CF) and Indium sealings under vibrational and static loads are presented as well as test results for the entire pumping system. The thermal control system of the MAIUS-1 scientific payload has been designed using multiple MATLAB codes in combination with ANSYS to estimate the heat flux into the rocket hull by aerodynamic heating during ascent as well as the heat transfer from the heated rocket hull to the system housing walls by natural convection. These codes and their theoretical background are presented herein as well. The thesis closes with recommendations and possible improvements for future space-born quantum optics experiments.",

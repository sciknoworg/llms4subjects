            "abstract": "Gene, FISH, geneFISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization, environmental microbiology. - Our knowledge concerning the metabolic potentials of as yet uncultured microorganisms has increased tremendously with the advance of sequencing technologies and the consequent discovery of novel genes. On the other hand, it is often difficult to reliably assign a particular gene to a phylogenetic clade, because these sequences are usually found on genomic fragments that carry no direct marker of cell identity, such as rRNA genes. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to develop geneFISH - a protocol for linking gene presence with cell identity in environmental samples. This protocol combines rRNA-targeted Catalyzed Reporter Deposition Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) and in situ gene detection. The method of rRNA-targeted CARD-FISH was previously developed (Pernthaler et al., 2002a). The gene detection method was adapted from Pernthaler and Amann (2004). It uses multiple digoxigenin labeled polynucleotide probes to target genes, followed by the binding of HRP-conjugated antibodies and catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD), to amplify and visualize the gene signal. However, the specificity of polynucleotide probes has not been thoroughly investigated and a rational probe design concept is still missing, because the well established concept for oligonucleotide probe design cannot be transferred to polynucleotides. Therefore, we developed a concept and software (PolyPro) for rational design of polynucleotide probe mixes used to identify particular genes in defined taxa. PolyPro consists of three modules ...",

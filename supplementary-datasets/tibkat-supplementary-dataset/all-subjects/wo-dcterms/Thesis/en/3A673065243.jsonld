            "abstract": "The extent of the permanent clinical disability in multiple sclerosis patients emerges from axonal damage and loss. In this study, we show a major role of the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR for axonal damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). After EAE induction by active immunization with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide MOG35-55, p75NTR KO mice suffer from a more severe disease course, demyelination, and axonal loss. To elucidate whether the increased disability derives from a more aggressive inflammation or a more vulnerable central nervous system (CNS), I examined both, the immune system during peripheral disease generation and the overt disease phase, and cells of the CNS in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. No difference with regard to the quality of inflammation was found using immunohistochemical, flow cytometric, ELISA, and mRNA analysis, ruling out a major role of the immune cell populations examined. However, constitutive expression of p75NTR by B cells suggests a role for p75NTR during immune response generation within lymph nodes, since p75NTR KO mice show increased disease scores from the very beginning on. To circumvent the effects of p75NTR deficiency during peripheral priming, EAE was also induced by adoptive transfer of an encephalitogenic MOG35-55-specific T cell clone in p75NTR KO and wild type (wt) animals with similar disease incidence ...",

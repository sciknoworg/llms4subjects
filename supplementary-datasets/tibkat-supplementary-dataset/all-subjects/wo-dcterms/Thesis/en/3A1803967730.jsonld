                "Natural resources such as water and nitrogen are essential for plant growth. In the future, water will be limited more frequently due to climatic changes. Therefore, varieties are needed that can tolerate periods of drought stress and use water efficiently. The use of nitrogen should also be efficient and sustainable, as excessive amounts of nitrogen are associated with emissions that are harmful to the environment. In order to obtain approaches for breeding improvement of sugar beet resource efficiency, genotypic differences in response to drought stress were studied in the first part of this work. In the second part, the response to varying nitrogen supply of different sugar beet genotypes was investigated.For the development of drought-adapted varieties, it is important to know the growth period with the strongest reaction to drought stress and a trait that can be used to identify genotypes adapted to drought stress conditions. Therefore, the trials described in manuscript I investigated the growth period of sugar beet with highest water demand and consequently the highest susceptibility to drought stress. Furthermore, possible reasons for genotypic differences in water use efficiency (WUE) were investigated, and also if this trait might be used for the selection of drought-adapted genotypes. For this purpose, pot experiments were conducted in the greenhouse with four genotypes in 2019 and 2020. Drought stress was simulated in different growth periods by reduction of irrigation to 50% of the water holding capacity (WHC). Under unlimited water supply (100% WHC), water consumption developed in parallel with the growth rate. This indicates that water demand is determined by the growth rate. Therefore, early drought stress caused the most severe yield impairment in the period with the highest growth rate, which could not be compensated later in the season. In contrast to sugar yield, water use and thus WUE differed among genotypes. However, no relevant interaction between genotype and water supply occurred, so there is no evidence of drought tolerance among genotypes with high WUE. The results suggest that WUE is rather determined by the genotypic sugar yield potential than by water supply. When breeding sugar beet genotypes adapted to environments with variable water supply, selection should focus on high sugar yield potential.  Manuscript II summarizes trials which investigated reasons for genotypic differences in the response to different environments, in particular drought stress under natural conditions. In addition, environmental conditions were defined for optimal selection for root yield and sugar content and the relationship between yield potential and yield stability was investigated. In 2018 and 2019, field trials were conducted with six genotypes at three sites with natural occurrence of drought. An irrigation treatment allowed the comparison with optimal growing conditions. Trials were also conducted with three different levels of nitrogen supply. In the absence of disease, no significant differences in the sugar yield response to different water and nitrogen supply were observed between the genotypes. Thus, the trials did not provide evidence for a particular adaptation of the genotypes to drought stress conditions, probably due to the sink limitation of sugar beet. In contrast, there was a genotype-environment interaction for sugar content and root yield. The greatest genotypic differences for classifying genotypes by either high root yield or high sugar content occurred under optimal growth conditions. As root yield increased, sugar content decreased similarly for all genotypes. For sugar yield, genotypic differences occurred in yield potential and yield stability. High yield potential was not necessarily associated with high yield stability. As it is important to achieve consistently high yields even under higher variability of climatic conditions, yield stability will become more important in future breeding.  In addition to a high water use efficiency, the efficient use of other resources such as nitrogen is also important for efficient and sustainable crop production. Therefore, the reasons for genotypic variation in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of different sugar beet genotypes were investigated and discussed in manuscript III. In 2018 and 2019, six genotypes were evaluated in field trials under different N supply at 65, 120, and 240 kg N ha-1. The trials showed only minor genotypic differences in N uptake and N uptake efficiency, but significant genotypic differences in NUE. The negligible interaction between genotype and environment suggests that the differences in NUE were independent of N supply and that there is no genotypic adaptation to low N availability. Rather, the differences in NUE resulted from differences in sugar yield potential. This indicates that selection for high sugar yield potential also rises NUE. Furthermore, it was concluded that high sugar yield potential results from an assimilate partitioning towards high sugar yield with a low fraction of leaf mass to total dry mass. In consequence, there were indications that lower leaf mass was associated with higher leaf N content. Whether high leaf N content can be used to identify genotypes with high sugar yield potential is unclear, but it became evident that high leaf mass is not a prerequisite for high sugar yields.The current study indicates that there are no sugar beet genotypes with special adaptions to drought stress conditions. As the water requirement of sugar beet is determined by the growth rate, the susceptibility to drought stress is highest in early summer, the period with the highest growth rates. Both water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency are determined by sugar yield potential, so selection should be made for high sugar yield potential when developing varieties superior under different environmental conditions.$v2022-06-27$v2022-06-27$xN$4LF",

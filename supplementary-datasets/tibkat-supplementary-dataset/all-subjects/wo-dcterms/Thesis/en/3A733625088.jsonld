            "abstract": "Most modern-day end-user software is Event-driven Software (EDS), i.e., accessible through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), smartphone apps, or in form of Web applications. Examples for events are mouse clicks in GUI applications, touching the screen of a smartphone, and clicking on links in Web applications. Due to the high pervasion of EDS, the quality assurance of EDS is vital to ensure high-quality software products for end-users. In this thesis, we explore a usage-based approach for the testing of EDS. The advantage of a usage-based testing strategy is that the testing is focused on frequently used parts of the software, while seldom used parts are only tested sparsely. This way, the user-experienced quality of the software is optimized and the testing effort is reduced in comparison to traditional software testing. The goal of this thesis is twofold. On the one hand, we advance the state-of-the-art of usage-based testing. We define novel test coverage criteria that evaluate the testing effort with respect to usage. Furthermore, we propose three novel approaches for the usage-based test case generation. Two of the approaches follow the traditional way in usage-based testing and generate test cases randomly based on the probabilities of how the software is used. With our third test case generation approach, we take a different direction and define a heuristic that generates a test suite to optimize our usage-based coverage criteria. We evaluate our contributions to usage-based testing in two large-scale case studies that show the value of our work ...",

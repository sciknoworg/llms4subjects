            "abstract": "Nucleic acids are not only one of the most important classes of macromolecules in biochemistry but also a promising platform for the defined arrangement of chromophores. Thanks to their precise organization by directional polar and hydrophobic interactions, oligonucleotides can be exploited as suitable templates for multichromophore assemblies with predictable properties. To expand the toolbox of emissive, base pairing nucleobase analogs several barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) chromophores with tunable spectroscopic properties were synthesized and incorporated into RNA, DNA and glycol nucleic acid (GNA) oligonucleotides. A multitude of duplexes containing up to ten BAM chromophores was obtained and analysis by spectroscopic methods revealed the presence of dipolarly coupled merocyanine aggregates with properties strongly dependent on the chromophore orientation toward each other and the backbone conformation. These characteristics were exploited for various applications such as FRET pair formation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments. The observed formation of higher-order aggregates implies future applications of these new oligonucleotide-chromophore systems as light-harvesting DNA nanomaterials. Besides oligonucleotide templated covalent assembly of chromophores also non-covalent nucleic acid-chromophore complexes are a broad field of research. Among these, fluorogenic RNA aptamers are of special interest with the most versatile ones based on derivatives of the GFP chromophore hydroxybenzylidene imidazolone (HBI). Therefore, new HBI-derived chromophores with an expanded conjugated system and an additional exocyclic amino group for an enhanced binding affinity were synthesized and analyzed in complex with the Chili aptamer. Among these, structurally new fluorogenes with strong fluorescence activation upon binding to Chili were identified which are promising for further derivatization and application as color-switching sensor devices for example. ; Nukleins\u00e4uren sind nicht nur eine der wichtigsten ...",

            "abstract": "In this thesis, the overall goal was to establish linear polyglycerol as PEG-alternative polymer platform for the half-life extension of therapeutic proteins and peptides. The aim was to design polymer-protein conjugates with a 1:1 ratio of polymer to biomolecule by employing mono-functional LPG and site-selective coupling chemistries. Furthermore, this work aimed to reveal differences between LPG- and PEG-bioconjugates in regard to their hydrodynamic size, bioactivity, and stability in vitro and their extended half-life and therapeutic efficacy in vivo. In the first project, a site-selective N-terminal conjugation strategy was developed which enabled modification of the therapeutic protein anakinra by employing LPG-aldehyde of 5, 10, 20 and 40 kDa. PEG-conjugates of the same protein were synthesized as reference. The molecular weights of the isolated mono-conjugates were systematically analyzed by multi-angle light scattering and mass spectrometry and confirmed close values for LPG- and PEG-conjugates of same nominal weight, with dispersities below 1.1. The hydrodynamic size of the bioconjugates increased with ascending polymer length, where the LPG-conjugates displayed slightly smaller values than their PEG-analogs. This finding confirms the general picture of LPG as a more compact polymer than PEG, even though differences were not as large as found for the free polymers. Studies on enzymatic and thermal degradation revealed a somewhat better performance for the more hydrophilic LPG-conjugates, which aids in designing more stable protein-conjugates in the future. Additionally, binding affinity to IL-1 receptor 1 decreased about factor 3\u20137 upon polymer conjugation, with no significant differences between LPG- and PEG-conjugates observed. Finally, a pharmacokinetic study of a selected Anakinra-40-LPG conjugate revealed a similar performance and terminal half-life than its PEGylated analog of same molecular weight. The second project focused on the site-specific C-terminal conjugation of the propargyl-modified ...",

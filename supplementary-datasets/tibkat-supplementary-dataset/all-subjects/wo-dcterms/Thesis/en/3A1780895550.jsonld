            "abstract": "This doctoral thesis addresses the synthesis and characterization of novel \u03c0-extended perylene architectures and the investigation of their molecular characteristics. The main focus is placed on a bay-functionalization approach, which enables the elongation of the aromatic \u03c0 conjugated system along the short molecular axis, although peri-substitution was investigated likewise. Within this work, the type as well as the size of bay-substituents was varied from small aromatic units to more elaborate moieties, whereby an unprecedented library of planar as well as distorted and chiral, three-dimensional analogues was prepared. The first part of this work describes the preparation of planar derivatives. Dibenzocoronenes were obtained via the fusion of small aromatic units, i.e. phenyl residues, with the bay-position of perylenes. The \u03c0-extended structure was successively converted into an amphiphile by stepwise introduction of two solubilizing groups with different polarity. Extensive investigations of all compounds revealed the strong influence of the molecular structure on the chemical properties, e.g. solubility, as well as on the photophysical properties. Moreover, the planar \u03c0 extended structure of the amphiphile was found to facilitate supramolecular aggregation in solution via strong intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0-interactions. VII Twisted hexaarylbenzene (HAB)-perylene hybrids were the primary target of the second part of this thesis and represent the most distorted perylene derivatives described so far. One perylene core was bay-functionalized with either one or two pentaphenylbenzene (PPB)- moieties. The sterically demanding PPB units provoked an extreme distortion of the PDI core due to intramolecular repulsion. Moreover, the extreme bulk of the substituents hampers the formation of distinct aggregation domains in the solid state, as confirmed by X-Ray crystallographic analysis. In addition, the influence of different peri-substituents on the photophysical properties was studied. The successful separation of ...",

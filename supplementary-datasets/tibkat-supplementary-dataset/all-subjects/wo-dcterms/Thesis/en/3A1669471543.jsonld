            "abstract": "The aim of the thesis was to gain better knowledge of the genesis of tail-biting, especially the influence of feed composition and feeding management. One of the main recognitions from the Literature Review about different scoring keys for tail-posture and tail-damage is that the selection of a specific soring key depends on the questions of the study and the evaluation conditions. Furthermore, it revealed that there is a general lack of comparability in terms of result interpretation. The emphasis of the 'crude fibre study' was on the influence of crude fibre in pigs\u2019 ration on tail-biting. This study was divided into two separate trails, one focusing on the amount of crude fibre and the other on crude fibre components. In both trials, a control group was compared with three treatment groups. The piglets of both control groups were fed a conventional basic diet with a crude fibre content of 3.4 % at the beginning of rearing period and 4.0 % at the end. In the first trial, the fibre content was increased by adding soya shells to the basic diet (G5: 5.0 % crude fibre, G6: 6.0 % crude fibre), or rather by providing ad libitum (AL). The second trial referred to three different crude fibre components: soya shells (SS), dried pulp (DP) or oat fibre (OF). The focus of the 'animal-to-feeding-place ratio study' was on feeding management. Therefore, pens equipped with a short trough (ST) and an animal-to-feeding-place ratio of 4:1 were compared to pens with a long trough (LT) and an animal-to-feeding-place ratio of 1:1. Furthermore, this study analysed the influence of the feeding management on the stress level of the animals and the correlation between tail-biting and the immune status and the stress level of an animal, respectively. In this thesis, a significant effect of the feed composition and feeding management on tail-biting in undocked weaning pigs could not be detected. However, it must be kept in mind that the batch effect overlapped the treatment group effect.",

            "abstract": "Transition, elementary teachers, primary school teachers, cooperation, working conditions, early childhood education. - The demand for cooperation between the first two levels of education has been discussed in means of an organic connection or at least an approach of elementary and primary school. Nevertheless, there is still a discrepancy between the demand for cooperation and the cooperation practice. The question rises: What hinders inter-professional respectively interinstitutional cooperation? The realization of cooperation is carried by individual professionals involved in the transition, which in turn have to deal with specific institutional and regional work conditions. The study determines interrelations mapped between cooperation and working conditions as well as it subsequently extracts repressive and supportive factors for cooperative interrelations. For this purpose, a total of 1525 elementary and primary school teachers were interviewed in two German states.",

            "abstract": "Erythropoietin (EPO) has potent neuroprotective/neuroregenerative properties in various forms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), i.e. established rodent models of acute multiple sclerosis (MS), and in patients suffering from chronic progressive MS. However, the mechanisms of EPO action in these conditions is still not clear. In particular, studies on potential effects of EPO on oligodendrocytes/myelin in the absence of immune-inflammatory components, which are characteristic for acute MS but not for the chronic progressive state of the disease, are lacking. Therefore, in this PhD thesis, the cuprizone mouse model was employed to investigate the effect of EPO on toxic demyelination. This model allows investigation of myelination processes independent of T-cell mediated inflammation. Feeding of mice with 0.2% cuprizone mixed into ground chow results in demyelination of the corpus callosum, whereas withdrawal of the toxin leads to spontaneous remyelination. The hypothesis of the present thesis was that EPO modulates both, cuprizone-induced demyelination and the remyelination upon toxin-withdrawal ...",

            "title": "Regulation of intracellular trafficking by UNC-50 and the GARP complex in C. elegans",
            "abstract": "Fast synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in C. elegans is mediated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which activates ligand-gated ion channels of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) family at the postsynaptic membrane. UNC-50 is a conserved integral Golgi membrane protein that has been shown to be critical for the plasma membrane transport of a specific AChR. However, the function of UNC-50 during AChR transport is not known yet. In this study, we use synthetic lethality analysis to genetically map the function of UNC-50. We show that mutations in unc-50 are lethal specifically in combination with mutations in factors that are involved in retrograde transport from endosomes to Golgi, like the Golgi associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex. This indicates that UNC-50 is also involved in retrograde transport from endosomes to Golgi. Furthermore, in unc-50 mutants we found defective gonad morphology which is caused by the aberrant migrat! ion of the gonadal distal tip cell (DTC). This defect is caused by the mistrafficking of the metalloprotease MIG-17. MIG-17 is normally secreted from the body wall muscles and anchored at the gonadal basement membrane to direct the migration of DTCs. This suggests that MIG-17, like the AChR, is mistrafficked in unc-50 mutants at the Golgi-endosomal interface. In order to understand the process of retrograde trafficking from endosomes to the Golgi, we functionally characterized the GARP complex in C. elegans. We show that the GARP complex has four subunits: VPS-52, VPS-53, VPS-54 and a novel metazoan subunit VPS-51. GARP mutants are viable but show lysosomal defects. We demonstrate that GARP subunits bind a specific set of Golgi SNAREs, suggesting that the GARP complex supports tethering to multiple Golgi domains.",

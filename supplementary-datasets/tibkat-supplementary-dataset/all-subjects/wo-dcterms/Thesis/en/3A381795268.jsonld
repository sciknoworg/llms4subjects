                "The majority of occupants of a school and an office building reported about complaints of health and well-being. The school was newly built and the office building recently redeveloped. We examined the air quality and carried out investigations by a standardised questionnaire. We could see a lot of health complaints in the office building resulting from a high concentration of TVOC (3.374mg/m3) in the indoors air. Repeated investigations after three months showed a significant decline of the TVOC concentration, down to 0.715 mg/m3 (target value 0.3 mg/m3). However, the complaints continued. Their numbers actually increased. Reasons, besides increased TVOC-levels, are steric factors like smell nuisance, lack of illumination, dry air, draft, other physical conditions and social problems. Occupants of the school suffered more from well-being complaints. Increased CO2-concentration is supposed to be the reason for this phenomenon because TVOC concentrations were only slightly increased (0.513mg/m3). After having announced the examination results and after an improved ventilation rate in the rooms, the complaints clearly went down. Considering these two examples, possibilities and limits of surveys and of air quality measurements during the assessment of indoors-related complaints are discussed. Other causes such as psychosocial or family-related problems should be taken into consideration, too. Remaining complaints after repeated investigations do not automatically correlate with success or failure of the measures taken. It is recommended to measure the CO2-concentrations in the rooms under normal conditions of daily use, to measure the ventilation rates and to improve the application of the questionnaire."

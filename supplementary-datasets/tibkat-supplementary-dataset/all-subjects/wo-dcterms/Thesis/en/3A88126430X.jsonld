            "title": "Relational Paradigm for Pastoral Care",
            "abstract": "This scientific work reflects experiences in school pastoral in South India using categories of relationships. The practice oriented background is the starting point of the reflection and its target is to provide a relational paradigm as an orientation for the practical work. The work proceeds in three steps. First, the theological and anthropological foundations are laid for a relationship-oriented education. From there the requirements towards the qualification of \"pastoral care-giver\" are described. God has revealed Himself as a relationship-willing God. In the Old Testament God chose a people to enter into a covenant with him and to guide it in a covenantal relationship through history. In Jesus Christ, he takes the initiative to remain as a fatherly covenant partner in dialogue with the individual and the people. Last reason is the Trinitarian God who is loving relationship in itself. The author works out the relatedness of the Holy Spirit to the people and shows its relevance for Pastoral care. Man, created in the image of God endowed the capacity of and the desire for relationships, is placed on a way of life, with the task and inner longing to gradually unfold and shape the variety of relationships for which he has been created.  This route is risky, dangerous, obstaculized and often unsuccessful, but also much gratifying when it succeeds. The development of dialogue and bounding is multidimensional: it entails the relationship with yourself (identity) with fellow human beings, with God and with the creation and the environment. To help develop the diversified bonding network makes high demands on the \"pastoral care-giver\". His expertise grows out of his own being and reflected experience; it arises from his ability to work on his own relationship skills. Intellectual training is indispensible; it may complement, but never can replace the inner competence. The author invites to rethink one\u00b4s own experiences of diverse relationships in the light of theology, anthropology and psychology. He encourages to blaze new trails by making new experiences in today's context.",

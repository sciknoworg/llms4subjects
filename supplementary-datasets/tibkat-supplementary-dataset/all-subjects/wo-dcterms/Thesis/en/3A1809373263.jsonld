            "abstract": "Methionine is the first amino acid of every newly synthesised protein. In combination with its role as precursor for the vital methyl-group donor S-adenosylmethionine, methionine is essential for every living cell. The opportunistic human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is capable of synthesising methionine de novo, when it becomes scarce in the environment. All genes required for the de novo biosynthesis are encoded by the metICFE-mdh operon, except for metX. Expression is controlled by a hierarchical network with a methionyl-tRNA-specific T-box riboswitch (MET-TBRS) as centrepiece, that is also referred to as met leader (RNA). T-box riboswitches (TBRS) are regulatory RNA elements located in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of genes. The effector molecule of T-box riboswitches is uncharged cognate tRNA. The prevailing mechanism of action is premature termination of transcription of the nascent RNA in the absence of the effector (i.e. uncharged cognate tRNA) due to formation of a hairpin structure, the Terminator stem. In presence of the effector, a transient stabilisation of the alternative structure, the Antiterminator, enables transcription of the downstream genes ('read-through'). Albeit, after the read-through the thermodynamically more stable Terminator eventually forms. The Terminator and the Antiterminator are two mutually exclusive structures. Previous work of the research group showed that in staphylococci the MET-TBRS ensures strictly methionine-dependent control of met operon expression. Uncharged methionyl-tRNA that activates the system is only present in sufficient amounts under methionine-deprived conditions. In contrast to other bacterial TBRS, the staphylococcal MET-TBRS has some characteristic features regarding its length and predicted secondary structure whose relevance for the function are yet unkown. Aim of the present thesis was to experimentally determine the structure of the met leader RNA and to investigate the stability of the met operon-specific transcripts in the context of ...",

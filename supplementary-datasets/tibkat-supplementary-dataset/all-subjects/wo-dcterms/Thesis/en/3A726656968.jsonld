            "title": "Estimating orientational water entropy at protein interfaces",
            "abstract": "The entropy of solvents significantly contributes to the stability of the native state of proteins. However, obtaining solvent entropies from molecular dynamics simulations remains a computational challenge. Reasons for this are first, that the phase space of solvent molecules poorly converges because they sample a shallow free energy basin. Second, its dimensionality rapidly grows with the number of molecules. To address the problem of phase space convergence, we apply the recently introduced approach of permutation reduction. Further, this method maps water molecules such that their resulting trajectories are restricted to a small region of space around a reference position without changing the physics of the ensemble. For density estimation, we adapted the efficient nearest neighbor (NN) method to the curved space of orientations. The NN method is entirely nonparametric and efficient on high-dimensional manifolds. For approximation of the total entropy, we apply the mutual-information expansion (MIE). The MIE is a systematic expansion of the entropy in mutual information terms by splitting the phase space into subsystems with reduced dimensionality. Orientational entropies of water molecules are estimated by the combination of these methods. Well-converged and spatially resolved many-body correlations of higher order are captured. The developed method was tested on specific distributions of orientations, the correlated orientations of water molecules from a pure water box, and the correlated orientations of water molecules around the small globular protein Crambin.",

            "abstract": "In this PhD thesis, the fully automatic data reduction pipeline of the Hamburg Robotic Telescope (HRT), first observations and the first analyses of stellar activity are presented. The first part of this thesis deals with the data reduction pipeline. It is based on the IDL reduction package REDUCE, written by Piskunov and Valenti (2002). I adapted REDUCE to take into account the properties of the HRT spectrograph. The data reduction pipeline was designed to automatically perform all standard reduction steps for Echelle spectra including an automatic wavelength calibration. During the observations form Oct. 2008 until Aug. 2009, the pipeline was shown to be working fully automatically and stably. All spectra which are used in this work are extracted with this pipeline. Furthermore, I could show that the wavelength solution depends on air pressure, air temperature and humidity. A correction equation was created to account for these dependencies. In the second part of this thesis, the results of the first HRT observations are presented. They show the potential and the current state of the telescope. Another important result is the creation of a new photospheric correction. These results were obtained as follows: First, a transformation equation was derived for the HRT S-intex to be the Mount Wilson S-index so that it is possible to compare the activity levels of stars observed at different observatories ...",

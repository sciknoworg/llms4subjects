            "abstract": "Evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have evolved preferences for those facial features that signal health and fertility and thus facilitate mate selection. While there is ample evidence for the influence of facial form in the perception of attractiveness, only few studies have addressed the significance of visible skin condition in mate selection, even though humans attach great importance to a beautiful, unblemished skin, especially in women. The present thesis focusses on the influence of facial skin appearance on the perception of a woman&rsquo;s age, health, and attractiveness with regard to the evolutionary psychology framework. Therefore, by progressively removing cutaneous age cues from digital facial images of women (aged 47  61 years), human noticeability of age related changes in skin colour distribution (e.g. melanin pigmentation, dilated blood vessels) and surface topography (e.g. wrinkles, fine lines) was determined, as well as the relative effect of both skin features on age and health perception. Moreover, it was investigated whether men differ in their health and attractiveness perception between young adult women (aged 24  29 years) being in their fertile and non-fertile phase of the menstrual cycle as a function of spectrophotometric measurable alterations in basal skin colour of the face ...",

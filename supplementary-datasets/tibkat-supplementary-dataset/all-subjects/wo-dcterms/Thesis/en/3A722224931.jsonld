            "abstract": "The tetraspan-transmembrane proteins of the M6-proteolipid proteolipid protein family are among the most abundant cell surface proteins in neurons. Their cellular function has remained largely speculative, also because their analysis has been limited to acute alterations of their abundance levels in vitro. Based on expression analyses I have hypothesized that neuronal M6 proteolipids have a role in neuronal development. Indeed, the results presented in this thesis show that M6A defines an F-actin-free structural compartment at the tip of axonal growth cones while its homolog M6B is mainly present at actin-rich neurite domains. For the analysis of neurite extension upon chronic deficiency of M6-proteins, single-mutant M6Anull and M6Bnull mice and M6Anull*M6Bnull double-mutants were characterized. Importantly, lack of either neuronal M6-protein impaired the extension of neurites from cultured cortical neurons ex vivo. Mutant growth cones showed abnormal compartmentalization and did not display normal growth cone collapse upon ephrinA5-application. The mechanism of action is likely to involve Eph-receptor signalling, as the abundance of the effector molecule ephexin-1 is considerably reduced in the absence of M6-proteins. Preliminary analysis shows that the formation of neuronal processes is also impaired in vivo, at least affecting the long-projecting cortical neurons traversing the corpus callosum at an early postnatal stage. Together, M6-proteolipids contribute to the structural organization of neuronal growth cones that is prerequisite for normal reaction to guidance cues and neurite extension ...",

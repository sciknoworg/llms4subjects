            "abstract": "Renewable energies are a critical element in containing climate change while sustaining economic development. The expanded introduction of renewable energy policies changed electricity markets due to increasing renewable electricity capacity and generation. Although some are convinced that policies have worked in selected markets, conclusive evidence on the effect of renewable energy policies remains unclear and is still debated. In addition, the change in national electricity systems is accompanied by the development of a dynamic industry sector providing the necessary technology components for renewable electricity production. While some countries are particularly successful in exporting renewable energy technology components, there is debate on the effect of environmental regulation on a country\u2019s manufacturing industry competitiveness. Furthermore, in this particular sector, structure and drivers of international trade remain unclear. This dissertation addresses a number of questions regarding the effect of renewable energy policies on renewable electricity supply expansion and international trade in necessary technology components. An econometric approach is taken to estimate the effectiveness of renewable energy policies on renewable energy capacity and generation development in EU countries and U.S. states. Feed-in tariffs and renewable portfolio standards are analyzed while controlling for country differences in policy stringency, policy design and supplementary policies. Analyzing OECD country and Chinese exports of solar and wind energy technology components the effect of renewable energy policy on determining country competitiveness and, thus, bilateral trade is identified. Methodologically, this dissertation contributes to the discussion on the role of country specific effects in applied micro-econometric cross country comparison as well as to the selection of proper estimators under the existence of zero trade flows.\u2026",

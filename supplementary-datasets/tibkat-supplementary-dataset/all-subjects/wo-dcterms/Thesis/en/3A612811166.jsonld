The investigated properties are the crystal structure, the crystallite sizes and size distributions, the compositions of the hydrate-forming gases, the hydrate porosity as well as the grain boundary networks. That was accomplished using X-ray diffraction, gas chromatography, Raman-spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. \"Bragg tomography\" was applied for crystallite size measurements of hydrates.Computer tomography using Synchrotron radiation was used for the first time for gas hydrate inspections on a micro-scale. The crystallite sizes of natural hydrates are governed by the velocity of crystal growth, therefore time is an important factor. One important result of this thesis is that the gas hydrate crystallite size evolution is also affected by more factors, which are impurities in the grain boundary network such as oil and salts. Gas hydrates from the northern Gulf of Mexico crystallize to structure type II hydrate (sII) from methane and a fraction of up to 30 mol% of C2 through C5 hydrocarbons. One important result of this thesis is that the lower molecular mobility of C2-C5 hydrocarbons compared to methane incorporated in hydrates is displayed phenomenologically by dense, non-porous surfaces of the gas hydrates on a micrometer scale. Instead, hydrates which were formed from volatiles like methane, often crystallizing to sI, are characterized by ...",

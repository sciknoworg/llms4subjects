            "abstract": "Cycling is highly beneficial, as it is a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and especially in urban areas, a fast and flexible means of transport. To promote cycling, it is beneficial to provide attractive infrastructure that meets the cyclists\u2019 demands and preferences. However, providing such an infrastructure requires knowledge about the importance and preference of route attributes as well as about the cyclists\u2019 subjective evaluation of these attributes. This thesis comprises three studies that aimed to gain a deeper understanding of cyclists\u2019 preferences and their evaluation criteria in route choice. The studies examined the motivational and deterrent effect of various route attributes, elaborated subjective criteria that cyclists used to evaluate route attributes, and lastly, bridged the gap between objective route attributes and their subjective evaluation. The findings suggest that cyclists evaluate their routes in terms of mental comfort, physical comfort, the attention towards potential interactions, the attractiveness of the environment, and the ease of use of the infrastructure. Based on these five criteria, results provide a comprehensive and multi-dimensional evaluation of route attributes. This deepens the understanding of cyclists\u2019 reasons to prefer or avoid routes. Results, furthermore, strengthen the importance to distinguish the preferable and avoidable effect of route attributes, as their impact on cyclists\u2019 route decision can differ. The detailed insights into the cyclists\u2019 perception and evaluations of route attributes can help to address problems in current cycling infrastructures, but can also be useful when planning attractive future infrastructure.",

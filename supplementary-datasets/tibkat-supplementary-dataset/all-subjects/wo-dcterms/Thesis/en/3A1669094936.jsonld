            "abstract": "Studies in recent years have shown that grey seals use other marine mammals such as harbour seals, harbour porpoises and other grey seals in the North Sea as food resource. The first report introducing the hypothesis of grey seals predating marine mammals was published by Belgian scientists in 2012. In 2013 predation of harbour seals was observed for the first time and reported from German waters. The present thesis contains a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on the predation of marine mammals by grey seals in German waters. With the help of two case reports and a detailed evaluation of the existing stranding database encompassing a time series from 1990 until 2017, occurring wound patterns are described and summarised in the form of several assessment criteria. Suggested parameters reflect the most common lesions detected and include besides others, lacerations, a smooth, cut-like wound margin, large parts of skin and underlying tissue that are detached from the body, as well as the loss of blubber tissue. Further, punctate wounds are often found in the blubber tissue and for porpoises also in the skin. Moreover punctuate fractures are repeatedly found, for example on the scapula or the lower jaw. Besides the lesions induced by grey seals, an overview on assessment criteria for an interaction with a fox is also given. Here especially a ragged wound margin is seen as relevant. Presented findings resulting from the macroscopic assessment are interpreted and discussed in light of former publications. In addition and complementary to the macroscopic evaluation methods, molecular methods are presented which allow a further characterisation of the predator. The documented behaviour can be regarded as largely consistent over time and between individuals. Whether this is related to a general specialised feeding behaviour or is even related to an individuals\u2019 personality remains unclear. Since the first recognition of this behaviour, work has been under way at national and international level to gain a better understanding of its scale and ecological relevance. In view of the presented findings, it must be assumed that this behaviour is at least partially widespread. However, our understanding is not yet sufficient to make a comprehensive assessment of the ecological relevance and should therefore be a major focus of future research. Likewise, through the use of standardised methods, future cross-national comparisons of the recorded data should be supported.",

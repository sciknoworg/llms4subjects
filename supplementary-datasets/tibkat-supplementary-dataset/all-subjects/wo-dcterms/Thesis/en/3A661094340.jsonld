First, theoretical concepts to describe electron scattering at real crystals including the effects of bonding and static atomic displacements (SAD) are considered. The approach of modified atomic scattering amplitudes (MASA), which uses density functional theory (DFT) to model bonding in an atomistic manner, is exploited to calculate compositiondependent MASA for InGaNAs. Valence force field (VFF) calculations are applied to determine SAD caused by atom size effects. Huang scattering caused by SAD is shown to pile up in the vicinity of Bragg peaks, contrary to the smooth background caused by thermal diffuse scattering (TDS). In simulation studies it is demonstrated that Huang scattering leads to significant attenuation of Bragg beam amplitudes, for which additional absorptive form factors can be defined that are added as an imaginary part to atomic scattering amplitudes (ASA). The reliability of VFF strain relaxation is verified by full DFT calculations of residual forces for supercells with 216 atoms. It is found that atomic forces after VFF relaxation do not exceed 10mRy/Bohr, which translates to a maximum error of 2.58 pm for SAD. Furthermore, results for composition-dependent structure factors calculated by full DFT and atomistic models are compared. This confirms that SAD affect structure factor amplitudes and phases drastically and exhibits that the MASA approach in combination with SAD obtained by VFF meets the full DFT results most accurately. Thus it is possible to account for both bonding and SAD in large supercells containing 106 atoms by modelling bonding via MASA and calculating ...",

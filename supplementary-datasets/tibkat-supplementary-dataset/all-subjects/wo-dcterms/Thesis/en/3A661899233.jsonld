            "abstract": "Juvenile hormone (JH) and nitric oxide (NO) both influence the reproductive behavior of female grasshoppers. The present thesis explores a possible connection between JH and NO signaling in the control of female reproductive behavior in the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus. The effects of JH on grasshopper females&rsquo; sound production and mating behavior were analyzed after manipulating the JH level. A functional relation between JH and NO on cellular basis was found by neuroanatomical studies. Observation of natural reproductive behavior of Ch. biguttulus females in small laboratory populations established a reliable temporal scheme for the succession of reproductive states. Imaginal molt is followed by a period of &lsquo;primary rejection&rsquo; that after approximately one week changes directly into &lsquo;active copulatory readiness&rsquo;, associated with female sound production that serves as a strong male-attracting communication signal. Females mate multiply before the first oviposition. Experimental manipulations of hemolymph JH titer demonstrated that JH is necessary to initiate and sustain reproductive behavior, but high JH titers suppress female sound production. Inhibition of NO production by systemic application of a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor increased female sound production while lowering JH hemolymph titers. Within the JH producing corpora allata NOS expressing cell bodies were labeled by NADPHdiaphorase staining, anti NOS immunocytochemistry and immunostaining of citrulline,",

            "abstract": [
                "Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) represents the third most produced species of diadromous fish, with the total production of 0,732 million tonnes in 2009. More than one third of this production comes from Europe, where it is dominated by Norway, Italy and France. Germany is the fifth biggest producer in Europe, producing 21 thousand tonnes of rainbow trout in the value of 6,1 million Euro. However, the conditions in the intensive aquaculture often increase the disease susceptibility to many pathogens. One of the highest economic threats for a salmonids aquaculture is the causative agent of furunculosis, Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. Several strategies have been developed to protect the fish, but the traditional methods are either laborious or represent a potential risk for the environment. The selective breeding established more than 35 years ago in the brackish waters of Baltic Sea represent a attractive alternative, delivering a novel strain of rainbow trout better adapted to the brackish environment and exhibiting reduced mortality in the infection with A.salmonicida. Nevertheless, no information was available about the fundaments of this phenomenon. Thus, the aim of presented study was the identification of immune adaptations, which occurred during the 30 years of selection and favoured increased survival of \"born\" trout to the bacterial diseas es. In the presented work, the peritoneal cavity of rainbow trout has been used as a model for the investigation ...",

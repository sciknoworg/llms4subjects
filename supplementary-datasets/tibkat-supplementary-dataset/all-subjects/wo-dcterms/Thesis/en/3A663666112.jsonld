            "abstract": "All nucleocytoplasmic exchange proceeds through nuclear pore complexes, which constitute giant aqueous channels in the nuclear envelope. Most of this traffic is mediated by Ran-dependent Importin \u00df-like nuclear transport receptors, which include import mediators (importins) as well as exportins. Importin 13 and Msn5p are known exceptions in that they can carry distinct cargos into different directions. We demonstrated that Exportin 4, in addition to its established function in nuclear export, acts as a bona fide nuclear import receptor for Sox-type transcription factors. CRM1 (also known as Exportin 1) is the cell\"s most versatile export receptor, recognizing myriads of structurally unrelated proteins. How CRM1 achieves this remarkable multispecificity and how Ran triggers cargo loading was a fundamental but unresolved question. The instability of export complexes was considered to preclude crystallographic studies. I established constructs and conditions to reconstitute stable and chromatographically homogeneous export complexes that allowed us to determine the crystal structure of the Snurportin1\u00b7CRM1\u00b7RanGTP complex. Snurportin is an exceptional cargo in that it binds CRM1 with an extraordinarily high affinity. The structure shows that Ran promotes Snurportin binding solely through long-range conformational changes in CRM1 and reveals how the exportin contacts a protein comprising an extensive and complex tripartite export signature that includes a folded domain ...",

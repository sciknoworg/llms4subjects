            "abstract": "The reconstruction of cellular functions in a cell-like compartment is a current area of research in synthetic biology. Mimicking biological processes such as metabolism, growth and sensing is of prime importance, but achieving motility and directed movement is also challenging in the context of biomedical applications. To address these challenges, we have integrated an efficient light-driven ATP regeneration system with two types of motility modules. First, we reactivated isolated and demembranated flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) with an artificial ATP regeneration module that allows us to control propulsion and beating frequency in response to light stimulation. Second, we constructed an artificial cell-like compartment by encapsulating microtubules with a force-generating molecular motors and light-switchable photosynthetic vesicles, in which we investigated motor-driven contraction of the filamentous network in response to optical stimuli. We have also constructed a bio-hybrid micro-swimmer by attaching a synthetic cargo with isolated axonemes from C. reinhardtii. First, we investigated the motion of the axoneme, which has an asymmetric waveform and is known to involve the superposition of a static component, a dynamic wave component travelling from base to the tip and higher harmonics. We report that calcium plays an important role in reshaping the axonemal waveform by affecting the static component and find that calcium concentrations above 0.03 mM trigger a transition from asymmetric to symmetric swimming trajectories. We performed principal component analysis, from which we conclude that shape of the axoneme can be reconstructed with high accuracy when the first four leading eigenmodes are taken into account. Next, considering the calcium switching mechanism, we built an axonemally-driven micro-swimmers that consumes ATP for directional transport of cargo at a speed of 20 \u03bcm/sec, comparable to the speed of human sperm in vivo. In addition to experimental studies, our analytical and ...",

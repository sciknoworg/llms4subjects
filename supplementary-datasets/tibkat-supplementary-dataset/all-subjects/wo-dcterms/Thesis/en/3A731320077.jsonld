            "abstract": "Tephritid fruit flies destroy fruits and vegetables, causing tremendous economic losses and bringing a barrier to trade in fruits, vegetables and their associated products. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), a target-specific and environment-friendly pest control method, has been used to combat several insect pests for over five decades and has proven to be quite effective against tephritids. Basically, SIT requires mass-production and mass-release of sterile insects to reduce the wild population of the same species. Sex separation prior to release is important in SIT for many insects as male-only release has been shown to achieve a more effective population control. Post release, the wild population and their released sterile counterparts need to be effectively monitored to ascertain the success of the programme. While SIT has achieved great success, improvements to the various technical aspects are constantly made as that will shape the method into a highly efficient, safer and cheaper programme to execute. Biotechnology has a great potential to bring desired improvements to SIT in ways that may be difficult to achieve by other means ...",

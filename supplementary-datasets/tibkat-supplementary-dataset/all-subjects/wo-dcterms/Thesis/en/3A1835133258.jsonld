            "title": "You \u2013 me \u2013 both of us? Insights into German couples\u2019 plans and practices of dividing paid work, housework, and childcare at the transition to parenthood",
            "abstract": "The present study focused on the question of why couples change their division of paid and unpaid labor when they become parents. The knowledge of changes during the transition to parenthood is well-established in previous research and quite stable in various countries. Extending this knowledge, the aim was to examine how couples, on the point of becoming mothers and fathers, perceived and explained these changes in their division of employment and housework, in what way they anticipated them, and how they explained unexpected changes. This analysis was done for West German couples as the western part of Germany is an example for the combination of a conservative welfare state that supports the male breadwinner norm, and parenthood ideals that increasingly suggest fathers\u2019 active involvement in childcare and mothers\u2019 labor market activity. In order to gain insight into couples\u2019 decision-making processes, a qualitative research design was used. Both partners in fourteen couples were interviewed twice, once during the woman\u2019s pregnancy and once about one year later. During the first interview, partners were asked about their current division of paid work and housework and its history. More importantly, they were asked about their plans concerning the division of paid work, housework, and childcare within the first year after the child\u2019s birth and their reasoning for these plans. Following-up on the first interview, the second interview focused on the actual present division of paid work, housework, and childcare, and on changes since the previous interview. The interview guideline was informed by theoretical mechanisms of economic as well as gender and identity theories. Before the birth of their first child, both partners in each of the couples were active in the labor market. For the time after the child\u2019s birth, the couples planned substantial changes mostly for the women\u2019s paid work and not for the men\u2019s. These plans were mostly realized. While a strong adult worker norm was present for men and women before the child\u2019s birth, this was less strong for women after having their first child. In the reasonings, economic arguments and gendered explanations were common. Housework was not divided equally in most couples before the child\u2019s birth; the female partners often did more housework and usually did more of the routine work. Most couples had no clear expectation for their division of housework after the child\u2019s birth, but there was a notion that the partner who was supposed to do more childcare was also expected to do more housework. Accordingly, most of the male interviewees reduced their housework. The argument of available time was most often referred to. The division of childcare was planned with more detail than the division of housework during pregnancy. Most couples planned the female partner to invest more time than the male partner \u2013 which is in line with the plans for paid work. Most couples put their plans into practice after the child\u2019s birth \u2013 at least more or less. Gendered explanations , (acquired) competencies and preferences were important in the couples\u2019 reasoning. Paid and unpaid work are interrelated; decisions in one area influence the other. However, the findings for the three spheres revealed that paid and unpaid work were connected in different ways before the child\u2019s birth, in the plans, and after the transition to parenthood. The study discusses limitations and policy conclusion. The most important policy conclusion is that gendered ideas about mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 share in paid work, housework, and childcare are quite prevalent, especially regarding the main responsibility for the child. Thus, policies aiming at enhancing gender equality should bear the narrative of the \u201cRabenmutter\u201d and similar gendered expectations in mind since the cultural context affects the acceptance of policies.",

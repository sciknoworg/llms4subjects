            "abstract": "The glycan polysialic acid (polySia) is known as a posttranslational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) occurring during brain development. In addition, (re-)expression of polySia-NCAM is featured by many cancers including glioblastoma (GB) and has been associated with poor prognosis for many tumor entities. Besides, polySia emerges as a factor with immunomodulatory potential, produced by microglia and macrophages. This pool of polySia confined to the Golgi compartment is attached to two protein carriers, neuropilin-2 and E-selectin ligand-1. Collectively, recent data suggest that the shedding of these polysialylated proteins constitutes a mechanism for negative feedback regulation of microglia and macrophage activation. In humans, Siglec-11 was identified as a microglia and macrophage-specific polySia receptor responsible for the anti-inflammatory response. In contrast, the corresponding murine Siglec remains elusive. Moreover, Siglec-11 has a paired receptor, Siglec-16, with an identical ligand-binding domain but, allegedly, proinflammatory activity. Notably, the SIGLEC16 genotype is disparate. Despite increasingly recognized importance of tumor-associated macrophages for immune milieu and tumor progression, the possible impact of Siglec-16 expression on polySia-positive malignancies such as GB has not been investigated yet. Using BV2 microglia as a model system, it is demonstrated that Siglec-E is the murine polySia receptor involved in feedback inhibition of inflammatory activation in response to the release of polysialylated proteins. In a cohort of GB patients, stratification for polySia on tumor cells or for a functional SIGLEC16 gene revealed that the two parameters independently correlate with increased survival and patients with a combination of both characteristics had the best prognosis. Together, this thesis provides insights into the polySia-Siglec-axis, its possible role in brain injury and its relevance for glioblastoma outcome.",

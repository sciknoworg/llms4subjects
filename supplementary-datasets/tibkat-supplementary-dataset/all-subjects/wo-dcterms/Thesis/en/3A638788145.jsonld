            "abstract": "This thesis explores diffraction properties of two kinds of random structures. The structures are described by (weighted) counting measures. The corresponding diffraction measures, given by the Fourier transform of their autocorrelation, are examined. The first kind of structure is given by sets of finite local complexity (FLC sets) in R^d with randomly attached weights from a compact complex weight set. The random mechanism is given by a class of Gibbs measures. In order to apply ergodic theorems to analyse the diffraction measure, certain measure dynamical systems of weighted FLC sets are considered. In a high temperature regime, the Dobrushin uniqueness criterion guarantees the existence and uniqueness of short ranged Gibbs measures on single FLC sets and gives estimates for the covariances of the one-point functions (Prop. 2.22). The Gibbs measures on single FLC sets can then be extended to the whole dynamical system. As a first result we give sufficient conditions for the ergodicity of the this way constructed Gibbs measure theta (Theorem 2.29). After that, we regard a related dynamical system that weights the points of the FLC sets with their expected weights. In Lemma 2.36 we give a condition for this system to be pure-point diffractive. By the ergodicity of theta we can almost surely split the diffraction measure into a part that corresponds to diffraction of the related dynamical system (i.e. a pure point part) and into a part that emerges from the covariances of the one-point functions ...",

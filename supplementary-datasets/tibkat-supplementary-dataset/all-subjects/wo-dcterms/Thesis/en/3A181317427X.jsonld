            "title": "Dissecting the role of Brachyury in Axial Elongation of the Mouse Embryo",
            "abstract": "The vertebrate body is laid down in a head to tail fashion by cells emerging from a growth zone at the posterior end of the embryo. This domain contains progenitor reservoirs providing the cellular material for axial elongation as well as the posterior notochord, which organizes the nascent tissues. The developmental master regulator Brachyury (T) controls progenitor maintenance, mesoderm formation and the specification of the notochord in a dosage dependent manner. How these different activities of T are regulated is not fully understood. In this study, I systematically dissected the gene regulatory landscape of the mouse T locus, where an enhancer cluster upstream of the T gene was mapped using ChIP-Seq. Employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, I show that deletion of this regulatory region disrupts notochord development and tail outgrowth. Within this region, I identified a critical notochord enhancer. The enhancer mutants display axis truncation phenotypes that are consistent with the necessity of high T levels for notochord maintenance and the essential role of the notochord in axis extension. Progenitors for axial tissues of different lineages are closely associated with the posterior notochord in a conserved topological arrangement. It has been proposed that the presumptive notochord provides the niche for axial progenitors and that these two cell groups together function as the organizer of trunk and tail development. To explore this concept, I analyzed the expression profile of nascent notochord, marked by a Noto reporter. Noto+ cells are the source of combinatorial Shh, Nodal, Fgf, Wnt and apelinergic signaling as well as BMP antagonists. The expression of some of these signals peaks at the stages of development when progenitor cells are amplified, indicating a role for Noto+ cells in this process. Further, I investigated the activity of the pluripotency factor Oct4 by light sheet microscopy throughout axial elongation, revealing a novel expression domain in a subset of progenitor cells in the early tail bud. ...",

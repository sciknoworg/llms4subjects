            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: The present dissertation focusses on the interface between two rather disjunct research fields - nonlinear spectroscopy of complex quantum systems and quantum optics. On the one hand, it investigates theoretically the application of nonclassical light sources from quantum optics as novel spectroscopic tools. On the other hand, it adapts methods from nonlinear spectroscopy to probe nonequilibrium physics in engineered quantum optical setups, such as chains of trapped ions.The first part mostly describes the interaction of entangled photons with complex quantum systems. The main goal of this part of the thesis consists in the discussion of the possible use of such photon pairs in nonlinear spectroscopy, and to propose suitable experimental setups. By investigating the wavepackets created upon their absorption, we show that multi-photon processes with quantum light are not necessarily bounded by the Fourier uncertainty, which restricts the simultaneous time and frequency resolution of classical light. It is argued that this advantage of quantum light is in fact due to the so-called \"time-energy entanglement\" shared between the two absorbed photons - i.e. the nonfactorizability of the photonic wavefunction in, both, the frequency and the time domain: The simultaneous resolution may only be realized, since the absorption of one photon alters the wave function of the other photon. Simulations further reveal how these nonclassically generated wavepackets may be detected in fluorescence as well as in absorption measurements. We further point out that this advantage in the simultaneous time and frequency resolution does not appear exclusively in entangled photon pairs, but that the underlying quantum correlations are rather generic in nonlinear wave-mixing processes, when the quantization of the electromagnetic feld becomes relevant.The second part of this work then develops a novel formalism for nonlinear measurement protocols in a chain of trapped ions. Here, the motivation consists in characterizing the emergent complexity of the nonequilibrium physics of larger ion chains. Since naturally a direct measurement of the global quantum state of a chain is only possible for very small systems, this endeavor requires tools targeting only specific properties of the system. We achieve this goal through the adaption of established methods from chemical physics to such engineered quantum systems. In strong contrast to traditional samplesin nonlinear spect ...",

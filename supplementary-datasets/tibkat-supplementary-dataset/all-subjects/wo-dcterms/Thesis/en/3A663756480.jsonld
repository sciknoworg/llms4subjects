            "abstract": "This PhD thesis reports the characterisation of the genetic diversity of killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR) as well as interactions between KIR and MHC class I molecules in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). In humans, it has been that KIR haplotypes have an influence on the resistance against various diseases. The rhesus macaque is a well established non-human primate model for several diseases such as AIDS. The diversity of KIR genes has been analysed in previous studies; yet, a genotyping tool for rhesus macaque KIR genes has not been described so far and detailed information of distinct KIR genotypes and haplotypes was previously unavailable. Furthermore, specific interactions between KIR and MHC class I molecules have not been characterised so far. One aim of this study was to establish a KIR genotyping assay for the rhesus macaque and to determine distinct KIR genotypes and haplotypes. Eight new KIR cDNA sequences were isolated from a NK cell cDNA library. All these sequences code for KIR3D molecules, confirming the high diversity of lineages II KIR genes in rhesus macaques. Using these sequences and those available in public database, a set of 31 primers for KIR genotyping was established. 25 KIR genotypes could be identified in four families containing a total number of 70 animals ...",

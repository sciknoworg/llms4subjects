            "title": "Metabolic synchronization of the liver circadian clock",
            "abstract": "The daily rotation of the earth around its axis determines the day length of 24 hours and the periodic change from day to night. Organisms evolved endogenous clocks to anticipate the light/dark alteration and associated occurrences. Every day this clock is usually reset anew to keep the exact 24 h periodicity. Responsible for the resetting, called entrainment, are so called Zeitgeber, which is a German word for time-giver. The circadian clock is based on a transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTL) of so called clock genes which are characterized by their own rhythmic expression and their ability to drive rhythmic expression of other genes, called clock controlled genes. Light is seen as the predominant Zeitgeber, because it resets the master pacemaker of the circadian system, situated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. In addition, food is an important Zeitgeber for peripheral clocks. If food is only available at certain times of the day, peripheral clocks phase uncouple from the SCN and shift towards the food time. In this project we targeted to identify factors which are responsible for the food entrainment of the liver ...",

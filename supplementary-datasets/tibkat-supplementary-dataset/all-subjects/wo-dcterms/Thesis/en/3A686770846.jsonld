            "abstract": "Agricultural intensification has transformed most grasslands of Central and Western Europe from extensive to highly intensive management during the last 50 years, resulting in a strong increase in biomass production and large reductions of plant species diversity. We investigated the impact of different management intensities and plant diversity on the structure and functioning of temperate pastures and meadows. The study took place within the framework of two projects in the Solling Mountains, Central Germany in the years 2008 to 2010: The BIOMIX project aims at disentangling the effects of plant functional group abundances and different types of livestock on species composition, grassland yields, plant nitrogen status and biomass allocation. The objective of the GrassMan project is to investigate the effects of plant species richness and land-use intensification on the above mentioned parameters and the water balance of meadows. At the BIOMIX site, we investigated the effects of different types of livestock in pastures with different abundances of herbs and grasses on above- and belowground biomass and nitrogen allocation. Pastures were grazed by cattle, sheep, or a mixture of both for two years before we conducted vegetation analyses, biomass sampling and biomass N analyses. Aboveground biomass was reduced up to 80 % by grazing while belowground biomass was not altered. Cattle reduced aboveground biomass to a larger extent than sheep in diverse pastures while sheep grazing tended to do so in grass-dominated pastures. The aboveground N pool was less reduced than biomass, because grazing reduced the C/N ratio of aboveground biomass relative to the ungrazed control...",

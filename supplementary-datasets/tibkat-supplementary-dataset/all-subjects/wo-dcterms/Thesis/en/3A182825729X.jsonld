            "abstract": "Cryogenic current comparators (CCC) are high-precision systems for the nondestructive detection of currents in the nA range caused by charged particle beams in accelerator facilities over a large frequency bandwidth including DC. In recent decades, the classic CCC concept has been further developed into a detector system that is indispensable, primarily thanks to its high sensitivity. Despite this progress, there remain a number of issues that have the potential to jeopardize long-term stability. In order to address these problems and to test suitable solutions, a prototype CCC with a focus on simple modifiability was developed and experimentally characterized in the present work. The classic CCC design consists of a pickup coil around a magnetically highly permeable toroidal core inductively coupled to a DC-SQUID in combination with a complex-shaped superconducting magnetic shield. To allow for more efficient modifiability, this shield has been greatly simplified. Furthermore, a second significant deviation from the classic CCC design was implemented: the twochannel operation. For this novel approach, two identical pickup coils including a toroidal core, each with a separate DC-SQUID, were integrated into the prototype CCC. The SQUIDs can be read out independently and compared using signal processing. This so-called Dual-CCC (DCCC) is presented in this work and characterized by experimental measurements of the response behavior to test signals. The two-channel operation of the DCCC was also the starting point for identifying various problem areas affecting system stability and for developing and experimentally verifying suitable solutions. The problem areas examined in this work are the significantly higher sensitivity to mechanical vibrations from external sources compared to other SQUID-based detector systems and the susceptibility to voltage pulses on the grounding and the external power supply.",

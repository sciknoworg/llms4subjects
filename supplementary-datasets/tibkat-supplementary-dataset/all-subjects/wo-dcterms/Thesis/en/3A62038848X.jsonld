            "abstract": "Computational Cosmology\u02ba is the modeling of structure formation in the Universe by means of numerical simulations. These simulations can be considered as the only experiment\u02ba to verify theories of the origin and evolution of the Universe. Over the last 30 years great progress has been made in the development of computer codes that model the evolution of dark matter (as well as gas physics) on cosmic scales and new research discipline has established itself. After a brief summary of cosmology we will introduce the concepts behind such simulations. We further present a novel computer code for numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation that utilizes adaptive grids to efficiently distribute the work and focus the computing power to regions of interests, respectively. In that regards we also investigate various (numerical) effects that influence the credibility of these simulations and elaborate on the procedure of how to setup their initial conditions. And as running a simulation is only the first step to modelling cosmological structure formation we additionally developed an object finder that maps the density field onto galaxies and galaxy clusters and hence provides the link to observations ...",

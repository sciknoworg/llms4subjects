            "abstract": "Light sources with specific optical properties are the backbone of optical technologies such as spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging. Yet, the creation of broadband, stable, and spectrally flat light sources, especially at low pump energies, remains a particular challenge. Supercontinuum generation (SCG) is a well-established method for broadband light generation in optical fibers. For tailorable SCG spectra, it is essential to accurately design and precisely control the dispersion of fibers with new methods. This thesis aims to explore nonlinear frequency conversion in resonance-enhanced fibers to create tunable broadband light sources with tailored properties at low pump energies. By depositing high refractive index nano-films with different thicknesses on the surface of the exposed fiber core, the dispersion of the fibers and thus the output spectrum of SCG can be tuned. Different nano-film geometries are investigated, featuring TiO2 nano-films with a uniform thickness, Ta2O5 nano-films with a gradually increasing thickness along the fiber length, and periodically structured Ta2O5 nano-films. Experiments and simulations reveal the advantages of a longitudinally varying dispersion over uniformly coated fibers concerning an enhanced spectral flatness and an enlarged bandwidth. Furthermore, periodically structured nano-films lead to multi-color tailorable higher-order dispersive waves via quasi phase-matching, which are outside of the wavelength range of classical soliton-based SCG. Resonance-based modifications of the fiber dispersion by using nano-films are a powerful new tool to efficiently shape nonlinear frequency conversion in SCG even at low pump energies. It has high technological potential for the realization of novel, ultrafast, broadband, and stable nonlinear light sources for biophotonics, environmental, life sciences, medical diagnostics, and metrology.",

            "abstract": "Laser spectroscopic gas sensing has been applied for decades for several applications as atmospheric monitoring, industrial combustion gas analysis or fundamental research. The availability of new laser sources in the mid-infrared opens the spectral fingerprint range to the technology where multiple molecules possess their fundamental ro-vibrational absorption features that allow very sensitive detection and accurate discrimination of the species. The increasing maturity of quantum cascade lasers that cover this highly interesting spectral range motivated this research to gain fundamental knowledge about the spectra of hydrocarbon gases in pure composition and in complex mixtures as they occur in the petro-chemical industry. The long-term target of developing accurate and fast hydrocarbon gas analyzers, capable of real-time operation while enabling feedback-loops, would lead to a paradigm change in this industry. This thesis aims to contribute to a higher accuracy and more comprehensive understanding of the sensing of hydrocarbon gas mixtures. This includes the acquisition of yet unavailable high resolution and high accuracy reference spectra of the respective gases, the investigation of their spectral behavior in mixtures due to collisional broadening of their transitions and the verification of the feasibility to quantitatively discriminate the spectra when several overlapping species are simultaneously measured in gas mixtures. To achieve this knowledge a new laboratory environment was planned and built up to allow for the supply of the individual gases and their arbitrary mixing. The main element was the development of a broadly tunable external-cavity quantum cascade laser based spectrometer to record the required spectra. This also included the development of a new measurement method to obtain highly resolved and nearly gap-less spectral coverage as well as a sophisticated signal post-processing that was crucial to achieve the high accuracy of the measurements. The spectroscopic setup was used for a ...",

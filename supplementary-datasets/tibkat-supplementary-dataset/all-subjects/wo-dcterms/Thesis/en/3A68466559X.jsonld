            "abstract": "This research focused on the reconstruction of historical fire regimes, structure and dynamic patterns of different types of forests, specifically to examine present tree species composition, regeneration patterns, size distribution, radial growth patterns of trees, composition, and structure of downed logs within different types of forests in the north-west Khentey Mountains, Mongolia. The Pinus sibirica-Abies sibirica (PiSi-AbSi) forests and Picea obovata-Abies sibirica (PcOb-AbSi) dark taiga forests consisted of more diverse tree species and had different size structures leading to a higher stand complexity than the Larix sibirica-Betula platyphylla (LaSi-BePl) and Pinus sylvestris-Larix sibirica (PiSy-LaSi) light taiga forests. Overall, the main tree species which occurred in the research area were present in all forest types, but they differed by the proportion of their Importance Value (IV). The PiSi-AbSi forest had a high number of P. sibirica and A. sibirica saplings, indicating that a future canopy could remain dominated by these species. Other tree species, such as P. obovata and B. platyphylla, which constituted a rather small part of the canopy, were also underrepresented in the sapling composition. In PcOb-AbSi forest, P. obovata made up only 5.8% of the saplings, while A. sibirica saplings made up the highest percentage (53.3%) of the total saplings, followed by P. sibirica saplings (31.7%). Also, the percentage of B. platyphylla saplings was higher (9.2%) than P. obovata. In LaSi-BePl forests, L. sibirica made up 54.3% of the canopy trees, however in the sapling tally B. platyphylla was dominant (77.6%); also it was well distributed in the different height classes of saplings ...",

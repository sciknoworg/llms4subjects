                "Asymmetric catalysis is an important topic for establishing sustainable chemical preparation routes. Mainly homogeneous catalysts consisting of single metal atoms with chiral organic ligands have been developed within the past decades, but their application on an industrial scale is limited due to practical disadvantages. The functionalization of supported metal nanoparticles with chiral, hydrophilic ligands and their use as asymmetric heterogeneous catalysts is a novel approach, exhibiting the potential to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. The present work shows the feasibility to transfer molecular principles from homogeneous to heterogeneous catalysts by ligand functionalization. This reveals a yet unexplored potential to tune activity and selectivity of supported catalysts. In particular, this thesis demonstrates that by ligand functionalization one of the greatest selectivity challenges in heterogeneous catalysis can be addressed: asymmetric catalysis.",

            "abstract": "Pre-service physics teachers often have difficulties seeing the relevance of the content of the content knowledge courses they attend in their study; they regularly do not see the connection with the physics they need in their later profession as a secondary school teacher. A lower perceived relevance is however connected to motivational problems which leads to both a qualitative and quantitative problem: not only is there a relation between the drop-out of students and their motivation, but their level of conceptual understanding is also suffering under this lower motivation. In order to increase the perceived relevance of the problems that pre-service physics teachers have to solve for the courses Experimentalphysik 1 and 2, an intervention study has been designed and implemented. In these content knowledge courses, first- and second semester students attend lectures, do experiments and they solve problems on weekly problem sets which are discussed in tutorial sessions. The problems on a typical problem set are however mainly ...",

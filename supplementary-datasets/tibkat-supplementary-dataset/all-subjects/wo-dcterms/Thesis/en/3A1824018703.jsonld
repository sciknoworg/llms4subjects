            "abstract": "In this work, we demonstrate how new theoretical concepts enable measurements of the signature of the QED vacuum nonlinearity beyond the background in collision experiments of all-optical high-intensity laser pulses. Using the vacuum emission picture, we develop the method of channel analysis of the signal. Based on these findings, we study two different experimental scenarios and identify discernible signals. In the first case, we consider the collision of two high-intensity laser pulses that differ only in their focus waist sizes. We present a numerical method to identify the regions where the signal dominates the background. Furthermore, we use this to investigate the behavior of the discernible signal, particularly with respect to the effects of the waist size of the probe beam. Of particular note, maximization of the measurable signal photons is not achieved by minimal focusing. This can be explained by the interplay of intensity in the interaction volume and decay behavior of the background in the far field. With the help of an elliptical cross section of the probe pulse, the signal can be further enhanced. Moreover, we show that a discernible signature of vacuum birefringence is achievable in the all-optical regime. In a second setup, elastic and inelastic photon-photon scattering mediated by the nonlinearity of the quantum vacuum is investigated. Based on a collision of four laser pulses of different oscillation frequencies, we observe signals in regions beyond the forward direction of the driving lasers as well as with frequencies beyond the laser frequencies. These features allow us to measure the signal beyond the background. The preceding channel analysis not only helps in the interpretation of the results, but it also allows effective amplification of the signal while maintaining experimental constraints.",

            "abstract": "Accelerated growth of freshwater fish during anthropogenic eutrophication has been attributed almost exclusively to the increased nutrient content, while density-dependent effects have been largely neglected. We evaluated the relative importance of these factors by studying the growth of 46 consecutive year-classes of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) from Upper Lake Constance. This prealpine lake underwent eutrophication from the 1950s to 1970s, followed by re-oligotrophication. Because whitefish are harvested with gill nets in a strongly size-selective way, we used back-calculated lengths of average fast growing fish to compare growth among cohorts. Standing stock biomass was estimated based upon virtual year-class strengths. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that growth of whitefish during their 2nd year was most strongly related to standing stock biomass followed by PO4-P content during spring turnover, and by calendar year, which was incorporated as a third independent variable (adjusted R\u00f8=0.87). The negative correlation between whitefish growth rate and calendar year is interpreted as evidence of an evolutionary response to the highly size-selective fishery during at least four decades. We conclude that density-dependent effects on whitefish growth are more important than had been realized previously, and that the impact of eutrophication on growth of whitefish needs to be reconsidered.",

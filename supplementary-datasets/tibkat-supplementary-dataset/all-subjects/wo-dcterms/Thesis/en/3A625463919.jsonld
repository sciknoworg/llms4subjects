            "abstract": "Geodesic equations, cosmological constant, analytical solutions. - The physics of a gravitational field can be explored by studying the geodesic motion of test particles and light. Although the majority of gravitational effects can be discussed using approximations and numerics, a systematic study of all effects can only be achieved by using analytical methods. In particular, exact analytic treatments can finally answer the question whether the cosmological expansion, modeled here by a cosmological constant, has an observable influence on effects as the Pioneer anomaly or the creation of gravitational waves. This thesis is devoted to the study of the geodesic motion in space-times with a nonvanishing cosmological constant using analytical methods. In each space-time considered here, the discussion of geodesics takes place on two different levels: The first is the classification of orbits in terms of the black hole and test particle or light parameters, which is used to compare the geodesic motion in different space-times and, in particular, to study the influence of the cosmological constant on a geodesic. On the second level, the analytical solutions of geodesic equations in terms of elliptic or hyperelliptic functions are derived and used to determine analytical expressions for observables. All space-times considered in this thesis are special cases of the general class of Plebanski-Demianski space-times, which includes the static and spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution as the most simple case ...",

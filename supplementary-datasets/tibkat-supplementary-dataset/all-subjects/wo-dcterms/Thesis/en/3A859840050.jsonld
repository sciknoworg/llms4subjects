                "Quality management in psychotherapy is necessary to reduce the number of therapies that draw a negative result. In therapy with adults, there are already existing models which are internationally verified. Also measuring equipment for the field of adult therapy is derived from this. These models and the existing measuring equipment were adapted in this study on the area of children and adolecents' treatment and tested in a field study on the possibility of their usage in outpatient children and adolescents psychotherapy. It turned out that the procedure in the outpatient area is easily usable. The active factors in the field of adults seem not to be adequate in children and adolescents. The results of this study show that the instruments to control process quality do not lead to the expected improvement of the treatment compared to the control group without the use of the newly developed measuring instruments.",

            "abstract": "Surfactants, linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), diesel, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), coral larvae, settlement cues, 16S-rRNA, bacterial biofilm communities, metabolism, respiration, photosynthesis, Siganus guttatus, Pocillopora verrucosa, Amphiprion ocellaris. - Coral reefs are facing a multitude of anthropogenic disturbances at ever higher frequencies and magnitudes. As a consequence, these ecologically and economically important ecosystems are degrading worldwide. Reef managers lack knowledge on how fish, corals and coral larvae respond to the effects of local and global stressors. This thesis reveals the significance of chemical pollution from localized sources. Two common pollutants (diesel and a surfactant) caused metabolic changes in a fish and coral species. Interactive effects were found and additional stress with high temperature mostly resulted in additive effects. In in-situ observations water quality influenced bacterial biofilm communities and the recruitment of coral larvae which is essential for coral reef recovery. Future coral reef management needs to address these issues more specifically to give coral reefs the chance for adaptation to global stressors and increase coral reefs recovery via recruitment through coral larvae.",

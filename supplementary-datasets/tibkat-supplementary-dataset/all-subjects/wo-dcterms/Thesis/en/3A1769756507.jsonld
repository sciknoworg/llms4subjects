            "abstract": "The first part of this study investigated intestinal epithelial barrier in celiac disease (CeD) patients. Intestinal epithelial barrier is altered in CeD. However, the mechanism underlying disrupted barrier function in CeD is not clearly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of human monocytes (CD14+) isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from active and inactive CeD patients on the barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells. For this purpose, PBMCs were isolated from healthy controls, CeD patients on gluten-free diet and active CeD. Monocytes (CD14+) were sorted by MACS magnetic cell sorting. CacoBBe cells were co-cultured with PBMCs and CD14+ cells. Cells were treated with or without IL15/Tglia to verify the role of gliadin stimulation on barrier function. Moreover, CacoBBe cells were treated with IL15/Tglia alone to exclude possible toxic effects of gliadin on the epithelial barrier. Transepitelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured to evaluate the barrier integrity. Confocal microscopy after immunostaining was used to verify the localization of proteins with role in epithelial barrier function (Occludin and ZO-1). Monocytes were characterized by cytokines production and surface markers profile, through FACs analysis. Intestinal epithelial cells co-cultered with celiac monocytes presented a more pronounced decrease in TER in comparison with healthy controls. Also, Intestinal epithelial cells treated with IL15/Tglia alone, as observed in untreated cells, did not present decrease in TER. Decrease in occludin expression and an abnormal structure in ZO-1 were observed after co-culture of intestinal epithelial cells and celiac monocytes. Analysis of cytokine concentrations in monocyte supernatants revealed higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin-6 and MCP-1. However, surface marker expression did not reveal significant alterations in celiac monocytes. In conclusion, CeD peripheral monocytes reveal an intrinsically elevated ...",

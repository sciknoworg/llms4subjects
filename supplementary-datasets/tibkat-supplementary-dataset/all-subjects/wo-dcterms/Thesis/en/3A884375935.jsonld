            "abstract": "Daily family life is highly relevant to children's educational journey. With this in mind, the present study focuses on the question of what exactly are the educational differences in everyday family life for children aged up to three years. On the basis of interviews, the study was able to identify ten differentiation and analytical criteria for sources of education within the family. With these, complex family circumstances can be differentiated, reflected upon, organised and put into order. A further main finding from the study is the labelling and description of three educational parenting types, determining and making apparent the different educational approaches of various family educations and lifestyles for children. The study is aimed at people in early education, at teachers and people in family-political, educational and socio-political fields. They will be helped to reflect the different needs of parents in order to meet them appropriately. They can better understand how parents deliver their educational information and thereby what subjective logic they follow, which then leads to different educational opportunities for the children.",

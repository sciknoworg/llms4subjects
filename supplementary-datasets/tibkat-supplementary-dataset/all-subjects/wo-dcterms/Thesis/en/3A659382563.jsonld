            "abstract": "Genetic background may influence susceptibility and progression of various diseases. The IRF-1 promoter polymorphism rs2549009 (G/A) and the variant rs2569190 (C/T) within the CD14 gene have been described as being associated with various disease conditions. In vitro experiments (EMSA; reporter gene assays) showed that the T allele of CD14 rs2569190 favours transcription factor binding and that DNA elements containing the respective variant allele promote gene transcription. The IRF-1 rs2549009-carrying DNA element induces allele-specific constitutive expression levels of a luciferase reporter in various cell lines. To determine whether these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) confer any functional effect on transcriptional activity in their natural genomic environment, analyses of allele-specific promoter activities were conducted by applying haplotype-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (HaploChIP) on ex vivo-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Therefore, antibodies were used that are directed against serine 5 and serine 2 phosphorylated (ser5-P/ser2-P) isoforms of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) that reflect binding and enzymatic activity at initiation and elongation stages of the transcription cycle, respectively. Ser5-P RNAPII was found to be preferentially recruited to the variant alleles of CD14 rs2569190 as well as of IRF-1 rs2549009, results that are in line with those from the above-mentioned in vitro experiments ...",

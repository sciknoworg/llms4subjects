            "abstract": "All animals are adapted to the environmental conditions of the habitat they chose to live in. It was the aim of this PhD-project, to show which behavioral strategies are expressed as mechanisms to cope with the constraints, which contribute to the natural selection pressure acting on individuals. For this purpose, small mammals were exposed to different levels and types of predation risk while actively foraging. Individuals were either exposed to different predator types (airborne or ground) or combinations of both, or to indirect predators (nest predators). Risk was assumed to be distributed homogeneously, so changing the habitat or temporal adaptations where not regarded as potential options. Results show that wild-caught voles have strategic answers to this homogeneously distributed risk, which is perceived by tactile, olfactory or acoustic cues. Thus, they do not have to know an absolut quality (e.g., in terms of food provisioning and risk levels of all possible habitats), but they can adapt their behavior to the actual circumstances. Deriving risk uniform levels from cues and adjusting activity levels to the perceived risk is an option to deal with predators of the same size or with unforeseeable attack rates. Experiments showed that as long as there are no safe places or times, it is best to reduce activity and behave as inconspicuous as possible as long as the costs of missed opportunities do not exceed the benefits of a higher survival probability. Test showed that these costs apparently grow faster for males than for females, especially in times of inactivity. This is supported by strong predatory pressure on the most active groups of rodents (young males, sexually active or dispersers) leading to extremely female-biased operative sex ratios in natural populations. Other groups of animals, those with parental duties such as nest guarding, for example, have to deal with the actual risk in their habitat as well. Strategies to indirect predation pressure were tested by using bank vole mothers, confronted with a nest predator that posed no actual threat to themselves but to their young (Sorex araneus). They reduced travelling and concentrated their effort in the presence of shrews, independent of the different nutritional provisioning of food by varying resource levels due to the different seasons. Additionally, they exhibited nest-guarding strategies by not foraging in the vicinity of the nest site in order to reduce conspicuous scent marks. The repetition of the experiment in summer and autumn showed that changing environmental constraints can have a severe impact on results of outdoor studies. In our case, changing resource levels changed the type of interaction between the two species. The experiments show that it is important to analyze decision making and optimality models on an individual level, and, when that is not possible (maybe because of the constraints of field work), groups of animals should be classified by using the least common denominator that can be identified (such as sex, age, origin or kinship). This will control for the effects of the sex or stage of life history or the individual\u00b4s reproductive and nutritional status on decision making and will narrow the wide behavioral variability associated with the complex term of optimality.",

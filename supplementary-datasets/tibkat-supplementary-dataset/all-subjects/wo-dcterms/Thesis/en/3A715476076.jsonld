            "abstract": "The purity of silicon starting materials and its contamination by several metal impurities are considered to be the major concern in silicon photovoltaics. Minute concentrations of impurities can have a detrimental effect on the device yield. In particular, Fe is incorporated as a highly mobile and soluble species during device processing. To improve device performance, we need to understand the properties of Fe-related defects in silicon and to design efficient processing methods such as aluminium getterring to remove iron from active device region. One of the most important techniques used to determine the electrical characteristics of Fe-related defects is known as Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS). This thesis is divided into four parts, firstly a description of CV characteristics at different stages of treatments. This is followed by the characterization of FeB pair in Fe indiffused samples and subsequently the effects of different protocols of wet chemical etching. Secondly, DLTS is used to study the segregation of Fe from crystalline Si to an Al:Si liquid at its surface, which is the basic mechanism of aluminum gettering used in silicon photovoltaics. Simulated and experimental studies are performed to obtain a reliable segregation coefficient for Fe ...",

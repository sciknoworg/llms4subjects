            "abstract": "Plum pox virus, chimera, symptoms, spread, ELISA, GFP, DsRed - Plum pox virus (PPV) is one of the most devastating diseases among stone fruits. A previous constructed PPV chimera (PPV-NAT-SoC_cp), established by exchanging the coat protein of a PPV-NAT full-length clone with the coat protein of PPV-SoC, showed more severe effects on Nicotiana benthamiana (tobacco) plants than the parental isolates PPV-NAT and PPV-SoC; high temperatures in summer time led to mortal symptoms on single infected plants. In winter season, all three viruses exhibited a similar expression of symptom severity and differed only in characteristics of symptoms. The coat protein production of all three viruses was estimated by 'plate-trapped' ELISA; a correlation between ELISA readings and symptom severity could not be demonstrated. However, PPV-NAT showed a significantly higher coat protein production than PPV-SoC or the chimera. It was concluded that the severity of symptoms on the one hand was based on the interaction of the SoC coat protein with the other viral proteins of PPV-NAT, and on the other hand, that symptom expression seemed to be dependent on environmental and climatic influences as well as on the interactions between virus and host plant. In anther observation, a correlation between coat protein concentration of PPV-NAT and PPV-NAT-SoC_cp, estimated by ELISA, and viable infectious virus particles, assessed by a local lesion test, could not be drawn. Furthermore, a defined concentration of PPV-NAT-SoC_cp was inoculated together with PPV-NAT in different dilution grades onto N. benthamiana plants. PPV-NAT was able to outcompete the chimera; only in very low concentrations of PPV-NAT, the chimera could be detected by RT-PCR. Crude sap from systemic infected leaves was transferred onto healthy plants; 8 dpi, the chimera was not any longer detectable in these plants. It was speculated that whether the higher replication rate of PPV-NAT, and/or a more effective spread of this virus could supersede the chimera. For verification, a DsRed-fluorescent gene labelled full-length clone should have been constructed and being observed in mixed infections with a GFP-labelled PPV-NAT. The cloning procedure was successful but delivered non-infectious full-length clones. A different cloning procedure was taken into account but could not be finished. It seems to be most probably that in further experiments an infectious full-length clone would be obtained.",

            "abstract": "Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that result in selective degeneration of upper and/or lower motor neurons (MNs). The precise causes of most MNDs remain poorly resolved and treatment options are currently mostly limited to the easing of symptoms and intensive care efforts. Remarkably, distinct MN subtypes display dramatic differences regarding their vulnerability towards degeneration in MNDs. The mechanistic basis for these inherent differences of the MN subtypes remains unknown. In order to understand what renders different motor neuron subtypes vulnerable, or resistant the thesis project first aimed to identify genetic factors linked to the different MN subtype. To achieve this, a transcriptome-wide screen of vulnerable versus resistant MN subtypes was performed. Firstly, this comprised identifying the transcriptome of MNs innervating the M. Rectus femoris (RF), a predominantly fast muscle innervated by fast MNs that are highly susceptible to MNDs. Secondly, the RF transcriptome was compared to that of the MNs innervating the M. Soleus (S), a slow muscle innervated mainly by slow MNs that are relatively resistant towards MNDs. Thirdly, as an example for resistant MNs, the gene signatures of both the RF and S MNs were compared to the transcriptome of the MNs innervating the M. Bulbocavernosus (BCV) muscle ...",

            "abstract": "ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli are resistant to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics, which drastically limits therapeutic options for bacterial infections in veterinary and human medicine. The airborne emission of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli from livestock has previously been published in several studies. However, these direct emissions from livestock facilities are limited to small local areas in the vicinity of the stables. Airborne emissions of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli may also result from the agricultural use of ESBL/AmpC-positive fertilizers and wind erosion, which could affect the upper soil layers of soil amended with ESBL/AmpC-positive fertilizers. These potential emission routes could lead to an airborne exposure of the general population to ESBL/AmpC E. coli and therefore pose a health risk. This hypothesis was examined in detail in this study by four practical and experimental test series with different approaches. In the short-term chicken litter storage trials, which were carried out under practical conditions, the inactivation kinetics of ESBL-producing E. coli was investigated under different environmental conditions (summer and winter). In the field trials, also carried out under practical conditions, it was investigated whether the application of ESBL/AmpC-positive organic fertilizers leads to an airborne spread of culturable ESBL/AmpC -producing E. coli during agricultural operations (application and incorporation). In the wind erosion trials, the airborne dissemination of ESBL/AmpC -producing E. coli from sandy soil fertilized with ESBL/AmpC-positive chicken litter was investigated under practically relevant conditions. Finally, aerosol chamber trials were carried out to explore the tenacity of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in the airborne state under different environmental conditions. In field trials with ESBL-positive chicken litter, even for organic fertilizers with high concentrations of ESBL-producing E. coli (2.1 x 105 cfu/g pooled feces), the number of ESBL E. coli dropped below the ...",

            "abstract": "Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat is a worldwide occurring disease reducing both grain yield and wheat quality. Grain quality is primarily degraded because of mycotoxins produced by several Fusarium spp. So far, comparatively few studies focused on the impact of FHB on technological quality traits of wheat most using rather less practical samples. With the objective to gain naturally infected samples, a field experiment was conducted in 2007-2009 at two locations with two bread wheat cultivars differing widely in their susceptibility against FHB. They were grown after pre-crop winter wheat, maize, and sugar beet using minimum tillage. Three different fungicides, strobilurin, chlorthalonil, and triazole, were applied during shooting. Whole grain flour (WGF), flour Type 550, and bran were milled from cleaned wheat and investigated for Fusarium graminearum DNA (FgDNA) and Fusarium culmorum DNA (FcDNA) as well as mycotoxin content (deoxynivalenol (DON) and derivates, zearalenone (ZEA), nivalenol and derivates). FgDNA made up the major proportion of total Fusarium DNA (FgDNA + FcDNA), DON was the most frequently detected and quantitatively most important mycotoxin in all milling products. The occurrence and quantity of FgDNA and DON was significantly influenced by all experimental factors considered ...",

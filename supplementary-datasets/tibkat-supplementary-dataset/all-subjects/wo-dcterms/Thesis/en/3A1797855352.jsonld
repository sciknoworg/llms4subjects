            "abstract": "Photosynthetic plants have a remarkable ability to modify their metabolism and development according to ever changing environmental conditions. The root system displays continuous growth of the primary root and formation of lateral roots enabling efficient water and nutrient uptake and anchorage of the plant in soil. With regard to lateral roots, development is post-embryonic, originating from the pericycle of the primary root. Coordinated activity of several molecular signalling pathways controlled by the hormone auxin is important throughout all stages of lateral root development.At first, two adjacent Xylem Pole Pericycle (XPP) cells are activated and the nuclei of these cells migrate towards a common cell wall.This is followed by XPP cells acquiring volume thus swelling up.The XPP cells then undergo anticlinal cell division, followed by a series of periclinal and anticlinal divisions,leading to lateral root primordia.These break through the radial cell layers and emerge out the primary root. Although root system plasticity is well-described in response to environmental cues such as ion nutrition in the soil, little is known on how root development is shaped according to the endogenous energy status of the plant.In this study, we were able to connect limited perturbations in photosynthetic energy supply to lateral root development.We established two experimental systems \u2013 treatment with low light and unexpected darkness which led to short-term energy imbalance in the plant.These short perturbations administered, showed an increase in the emerged lateral root density and decrease in root hexose availability and activation of the low energy marker gene ASN1 (ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE 1).Although not demonstrated, presumably, these disturbances in the plant energy homeo-stasis activates SnRK1 (SNF1 RELATED KINASE 1),an evolutionary conserved kinase mediat-ing metabolic and transcriptional responses towards low energy conditions. In A. thaliana, two catalytic \u03b1-subunits of this kinase (SnRK1.\u03b11 and SnRK1.\u03b12) are ...",

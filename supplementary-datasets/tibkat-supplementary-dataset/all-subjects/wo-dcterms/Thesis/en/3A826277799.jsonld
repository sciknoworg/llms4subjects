            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: Damage in silicon wafers from handling and processing is a severe problem in device production. A high resolution X-ray method is developed to characterize and to quantify the damage in the crystal. For this reason, a series of silicon (001) wafers treated with various loads of nanoindentation (from 200 mN to 2 N) were investigated by the X-ray Micro-diffraction Imaging method. By combining single crystal diffraction and diffuse scattering with high resolution imaging, detailed information on micro-structural defects and local strain field in the indented silicon wafers were obtained. The integrated intensity, width and position shift, diffuse scattering components were extracted from the measured diffraction profile in the image data, and spatially resolving mapping of these parameters were presented. The strain field and defect distribution, as revealed by the two or three dimensional maps, obtained at 004 and 220 diffractions, are dependent on the indentation load, crystal anisotropy and annealing treatment. The indentations generate strain fields extending to a domain much larger and deeper than the plastically deformed zones around the indenter impression. The plastic deformation and extensive compressive, tensile fields produce also diffuse scattering and from which defects can be characterized. The analysis of diffuse scattering indicated an elastic character for the strain field",

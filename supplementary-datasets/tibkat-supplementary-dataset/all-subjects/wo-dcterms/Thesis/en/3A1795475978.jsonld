            "abstract": "Among different semiconductors, the largest number of studies for solar energy conversion are being conducted on titanium dioxide (TiO2). TiO2 is a semiconductor with high photoactivity which is inexpensive, non-toxic, and stable in chemical and photochemical reactions. TiO2 is mainly used in nanostructure forms such as zero-dimensional (e.g. nanoparticles), one-dimensional (e.g. nanotubes and nanorods) and two-dimensional (e.g. nanosheets). Nanostructured TiO2 can provide unique advantages such as high surface area and directional electron transfer properties for photovoltaic and photocatalysis reactions. In this thesis we focus on synthesizing nanostructured TiO2 and employing novel approaches for modifying its properties for use in photovoltaic solar cells and photocatalysis H2 evolution. Firstly, we engineered the interface of the electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite light absorber in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanorods were used as ETL in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI)-based perovskite solar cells. TiO2 nanorods show excellent charge carrier mobility and high electron lifetime which are two key properties of an efficient electron transport layer. For the first time, the effect of dual modification of TiO2 nanorods (NRs) array surface with TiCl4 treatment and PC61BM monolayer deposition on the overall cell performance was studied. Under dual modifications, synergistic effects were observed which result in significant improvement in cell efficiency and reduction of device hysteresis. The performance enhancement is attributed to the efficient electron mobility at the interface of TiO2 ETL with perovskite film due to the passivation of defects. Secondly, the effect of the crystallographic phase structure of TiO2 thin film as ETL on the cell efficiency of MAPI-based perovskite solar cells is explored. Anatase and rutile TiO2 were deposited by magnetron sputtering technique under controlled conditions. The results show the comparable performance of the devices ...",

            "abstract": "Proper cellular function requires precise and dynamic assembly of multiple structural, regulatory and signalling molecules. Scaffold proteins serve exactly this purpose by functioning as protein-interaction hubs and providing interaction surfaces to a broad variety of proteins. Especially in polarised cells and at cell-cell contact sites, scaffold proteins are indispensable for the positioning and anchoring of diverse classes of proteins. A very particular type of cell-cell contact in highly polarised cells are chemical synapses, where different scaffold proteins, like the prototypical PSD-95, are critical for the proper recruitment and membrane localisation of transmembrane proteins, receptors and ion channels. Scaffold proteins assemble assemble them together with regulatory and additional scaffold proteins into large multiprotein complexes that are responsible for synapse formation, maintenance and plasticity. MPP2 belongs to the MPP subfamily of membrane- associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) scaffold proteins, which has primarily been studied for its importance at epithelial cell-contact sites. The present thesis describes MPP2 as a novel scaffold protein at the postsynapse of central neurons. It is demonstrated to be associated with core components of AMPA receptor complexes and directly interacting with the abundant postsynaptic scaffold proteins PSD-95 and GKAP. MPP2 was found at postsynapses of hippocampal neurons, where it co-localises with the transmembrane cell adhesion protein SynCAM1 that was identified as a specific ligand to the MPP2 PDZ domain. SynCAM1 is an important synaptic cell adhesion protein with functions for the formation and maintenance of stable synaptic contacts. Taking advantage of diverse super-resolution imaging pproaches, MPP2 and SynCAM1 were found in a particular spatial arrangement at the border of the postsynaptic density (PSD). Distinct nanoclusters of both proteins are positioned juxtaposed and almost alternating, forming a bracelet-like structure surrounding the PSD border. ...",

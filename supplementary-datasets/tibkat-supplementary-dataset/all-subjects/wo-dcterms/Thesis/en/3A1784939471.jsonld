                "Midges are small mosquitoes that can transmit pathogens to susceptible hosts through their blood-sucking act. They are known as biological vectors that can transmit the bluetongue virus (BTV) and the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) to ruminants, among others. Various vector control measures can be used to curtail the spread of the virus during an epidemic. However, for effective vector measures, it is essential to have profound knowledge of the role of biting midges as vectors, as well as their biology and phenology. For several years, midges were not in the focus of research and there are still considerable gaps in knowledge. Therefore, the present work examines various aspects of biting midges of the genus Culicoides, whose function as vectors of the Schmallenberg virus was already proven at the beginning of the project. The aim of the first part of this work was to determine the percentage of infected midges in various German areas in order to determine the influence of Culicoides midges within the virus epidemic. For this purpose, samples, collected during 2011 and 2012 as part of monitoring projects, were analysed. Additionally, in early 2013, various farms in southern and eastern regions of Germany, where SBV was considered to be largely absent, were equipped with UV traps. The small number of virus-positive samples did not allow a more precise assessment of the viral spread in culicoid midges. Instead, it revealed the importance to conduct targeted samplings of its vectors ..."

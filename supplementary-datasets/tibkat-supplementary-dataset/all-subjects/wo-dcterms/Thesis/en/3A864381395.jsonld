            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: Escherichia coli is a gram-negative bacterium that is able to adjust its energy conservation in a variety of diverse environmental conditions. In the presence of oxygen, its respiratory chain is mainly composed of three primary dehydrogenases and three terminal oxidases. These are the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, also known as respiratory complex I, the alternative NADH dehydrogenase Ndh-II and the succinate dehydrogenase. The terminal oxidases are the bo3, bd-I and bd-II quinol oxidases. It was assumed that the putative NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenases WrbA, QOR and YhdH are also part of the aerobic E. coli respiratory chain. These dehydrogenases were thought to be associated with the membrane, though it was reported in the literature that they are soluble proteins. Here, it was shown that WrbA, QOR and YhdH are indeed in the membrane fraction, after centrifugation steps following cell disruption. Through inactivation of the appropriate genes and characterisation of the mutants, it was shown that these enzymes do not participate in aerobic respiration. Furthermore, it was shown by mutagenesis studies that under oxic conditions, electrons from NADH are preferably fed into the respiratory chain by complex I, while Ndh-II contributes a smaller share to the electron transfer. Complex I catalyses the oxidation of NADH and the reduction of ubiquinone, coupled with the translocation of four protons across the membrane. Its 13 subunits form the L-shape overall structure. The peripheral arm, protruding into the cytosol, harbours all cofactors, namely one non-covalently bound FMN and nine iron sulfur (Fe/S)-clusters. The hydrophobic arm catalysing the proton translocation is embedded in the membrane. The coupling between both processes is not understood",

            "title": "The elusive question of success in the fight against corruption : an analysis of the anti-corruption field in Georgia",
            "abstract": "The topic of my thesis is anti-corruption activities in Georgia and the background of my research is the rise of corruption as a major development issue in the last two decades as well as Georgia\u2019s status as a model for successful anti-corruption reforms after the revolution of 2003. The starting point of my research is a striking fact that is difficult to explain if we conform to standard views about anti-corruption. Indeed, there is a consensus on the fact that Georgia has been successful in fighting corruption after the revolution of 2003. At the same time, some more critical voices also exist that point to shortcomings in the government\u2019s measures. Further, we observe that tensions between international organisations and the Georgian government appear to have increased in the post-revolutionary context in contrast to the previous period under Eduard Shevardnadze\u2019s government that was characterised by systemic corruption. This situation is unexpected to the extent that one would assume that a pro-reform government would rather win the approval of donor organisations and have no difficulty in gaining their support. Against the background of these observations, I want to explain the nature of the tensions between anti-corruption actors as well as the contestation of Georgia\u2019s claims to success in fighting corruption.",

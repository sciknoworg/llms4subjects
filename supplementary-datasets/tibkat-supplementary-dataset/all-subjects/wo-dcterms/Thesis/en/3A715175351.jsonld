            "abstract": "Fibrous materials are very commonplace in current technological applications. The study of their mechanics is an interesting topic that has previously been inspired by applications in the textile and paper industries, but also by modern composite materials. In many applications, humidity of the ambient atmosphere leads to condensation of liquid in a fiber network. Once liquid interfaces form, capillary effects lead to internal mechanical stresses. In this work, we investigate the effects of capillary stresses on disordered, two-dimensional networks of elastic fibers. To that end, we first study the morphologies and induced stresses of a liquid bridge forming between two cylindrical fibers. Then, we introduce a two-dimensional model system for disordered fiber networks with liquid interactions taking place at fiber crossings. After an overview of the topological properties of such a model network, we introduce a method for computer simulation of an elastic network in the presence of a wetting liquid that can accumulate in the fiber interstices and thereby deform the network. We test the model by comparison with analytical theory in a simple test case, and finally we present computer experiments characterizing the network deformation as a function of the most important model parameters, the fiber density and the capillary interaction strength ...",

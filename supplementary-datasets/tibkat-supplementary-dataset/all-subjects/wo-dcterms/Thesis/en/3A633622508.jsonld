            "title": "The evolutionary origin of \"floral quartets\" : clues from molecular interactions of orthologues of floral homeotic proteins from the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon",
            "abstract": "The identity of floral organs in angiosperms is specified by multimeric transcription factor complexes composed of floral homeotic MADS-domain proteins that bind to specific cis-regulatory DNA-elements (&lsquo;CArG-boxes&rsquo;) of their target genes, thus constituting floral quartets. Gymnosperms possess orthologues of floral homeotic genes enconding MIKC-type MADS-domain proteins, but when and how the interactions constituting floral quartets were established during evolution has remained unknown. To better understand the &lsquo;abominable mystery&rsquo; of flower origin, in this project a comprehensive study was carried out to detect the dimerization and DNA-binding of several classes of MADS-domain proteins from a gymnosperm, Gnetum gnemon of the Gnetales. Determination of protein-protein interactions by pull-down assays revealed complex patterns of heterodimerization among orthologues of class B, class C and class E floral homeotic proteins and Bsister proteins, while homodimerization was not observed. In contrast, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed that all proteins tested except one bind to CArG-boxes also as homodimers, suggesting that homodimerization is relatively weak, but facilitated by DNA-binding. Proteins able of DNA-based homodimerization include orthologues of class B and C proteins; B and C proteins also form heterodimers in vitro and in yeast, which is in sharp contrast to their orthologues from angiosperms, which require class E floral proteins to &lsquo;glue&rsquo; them together in multimeric complexes.",

            "abstract": "In this thesis a hydrologic model of an agriculturally used basin in China is constructed. The project area, the Yanqi basin, is located in the Northwestern Chinese province of Xinjiang. The climate is continental and very dry. The annual amount of precipitation of around 20 mm\u00d8a\u00a11 is negligible compared to the potential evapotranspiration of 1400 mm\u00d8a\u00a11. Nevertheless, the Yanqi basin has been one of the most productive agricultural areas in western China ever since irrigation was introduced in the second half of the 20th century. Irrigated water is drawn from the rivers flowing through the basin. At present, the irrigated area covers about 1.2\u00d8105 ha. As a consequence of this intensive agriculture, the productivity of the downstream systems is negatively a\u00aeected. The intensive irrigation has led to a series of environmental problems, the most important one being soil salinization. An excessive application of stream water without adequate drainage has raised the groundwater table during the last years,..",

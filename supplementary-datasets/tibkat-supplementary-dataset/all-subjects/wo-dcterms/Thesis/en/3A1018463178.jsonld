            "abstract": "Abstract: Cellular development and differentiation is characterized by finely tuned regulation of gene expression. The maintenance and ability to inherit gene expression pattern to daughter cells is - in part - controlled via epipgenetic mechanisms. One important epigenetic process is the trimethylation of the two antagonistic histone tail residues H3K4 and H3K27. While the former is associated with actively transcribed genes, H3K27me3 is mostly found among silenced genes. Some gene promoters, however, are associated with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and those bivalent genes are mostly among key lineage defining transcription factors.<br>One key iNKT cell-lineage defining gene is Plzf (Zbtb16). The Plzf gene is bivalently modified (H3K4me3+ and H3K27me3+) in psDP cells, right before the cellular fate decision between conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T cell or iNKT lineage restriction. In order for psDP cells to express Plzf and differentiate into iNKT cells, a strong TCR signal is required. This work shows that the expression of Plzf is accompanied by the transition of the Plzf promoter from a bivalent to a monovalent H3K4me3 state. The removal of H3K27me3 is an essential prerequisite for Plzf activation and subsequent iNKT cell development. Artificial removal of H3K27me3 through deletion of the H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 causes the development of iNKT cells, even in the absence of iNKT-lineage directing strong TCR signaling events.<br>In addition to its well described nuclear function, we also discovered a cytosolic form of the PRC2 complex that is involved in TCR signaling. The cytosolic PRC2 complex is essential for proper TCR signal propagation through the MAPK pathway and absence of PRC2 prevents the activation and proliferation of naive CD4 T cells. Interestingly, this defect is very specific and affects only the proper activation of the pro-survival cytokine IL2, while other T cell response gene are unaffected and induced normally",

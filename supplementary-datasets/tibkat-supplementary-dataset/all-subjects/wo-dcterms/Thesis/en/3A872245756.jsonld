            "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicle, AUV, Arctic, Marginal Ice Zone, Fram Strait, Biogeochemistry, Melt water front, Frontogenesis. - This thesis describes operations of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to investigate the complex interaction between physical forcing and ecological response in the marginal ice zone of the Fram Strait. The vehicle was equipped with instruments collecting physical, chemical, and biological data in the euphotic zone (0 - 50 m depth). After an introductory part, the thesis consists of six studies. The first four studies have a technical focus and they describe the integration of a water sample collector, sensors and a payload control computer. Additionally, supporting technologies such as flying drones and a filter to correct the AUV s navigation data are described. The fifth study tackles the issue of the purity and safety of the water samples inside the AUV. The last study has a scientific focus and presents the first direct observations of wind driven frontogenesis along a melt water front. Vehicle data were complemented by means of ship and model based data to explain the observed hydrographic structures and the distribution of chlorophyll a. In the final section of this thesis, open scientific questions and possible technological upgrades are presented.",

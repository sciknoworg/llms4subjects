            "abstract": "Small Ubiquitin-like Modifiers (SUMO) are 10 kDa proteins that are covalently attached to hundreds of intracellular proteins to regulate their function. In mammals, three members of the SUMO family are known to be conjugated (SUMO-1,-2,-3). Desumoylating enzymes (isopeptidases) play an essential role by ensuring reversibility of this posttranslational modification. At present, only a small number of these enzymes, members of the Ulp/SENP family, are known. They share a conserved catalytic cysteine protease domain, C48, wile remaining quite different in other regions. Mammals express only 6 distinct SENP proteases. This number appears extremely small, if one considers the plethora of SUMO targets that are individually regulated by reversible modification. For comparison, more than 80 different Ubiquitin proteases are currently known. This let us suspect that as yet undiscovered SUMO-specific isopeptidases exist. The goal of this work was to identify and perform initial characterization of a novel SUMO specific isopeptidase. Here I describe the approaches I undertook to find such an enzyme. The first approach used a FRET-based desumoylating assay developed in our laboratory. I adapted this assay to a high-throughput screen, and screened a partial bacterial expression library of human ORFs. While positive controls could easily be identified, this approach did not result in identification of a novel SUMO isopeptidase. This was due, at least in part, to the small size of the available library ...",

                "The microorganism Staphylococcus (S.) aureus acts as a commensal as well as a human pathogen. On the one hand every third person in the healthy human population is colonized without any clinical symptoms. These peoples are further referred to as carriers. On the other hand, S. aureus-induced bacteraemia is difficult to treat; the mortality among this systemic infection is about 20 %. Reasons for the insufficient treatment possibilities are, that the interactions between colonizing or invasive S. aureus isolate and the adaptive immune system of the host are - up until now - only poorly characterized. To investigate these interactions, a prospective study was performed at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, were sera of 2023 patients of high risk were obtained. Among these patients 14 later on developed a S. aureus bacteraemia. In doing so, the carriers mainly developed a bacteraemia caused by the colonizing strain (endogenous infection), whereas non-carriers developed a bacteraemia caused by a foreign S. aureus strain (exogenous infection). The invasive S. aureus strains were isolated and blood was obtained from the patients during infection. Consequently, sera from at least three different time points (before infection, at diagnosis, during convalescence) as well as the invasive S. aureus isolates from each of the 14 patients are on hand. With this material a personalized approach, to investigate the individual human B and T cell response to ...",

            "abstract": "As the emergence of the FEL sources opens up new opportunities in material research, the theory and modeling of the behavior of matter in strong x-ray laser fields, as well as novel approaches to scattering, become of an increased importance. First of all, x-ray sources with high brightness enhance the resolution of structural measurements simply by improving the signal to noise ratio, due to the increase in the photon count. With the assumption of improved signal to noise ratio of the scattering measurement the detailed electron densities become increasingly important as the diffuse part of the spectra, i.e. large scattering vectors, becomes measurable. An interesting alternative to proposed single molecule coherent diffraction is x-ray scattering measurement on a sample consisting of aligned systems. Compared to the proposed single molecule coherent diffraction, laser alignment decreases the demands on the x-ray probe pulse brightness since it benefits from scattering intensity enhancement, due to constructive interference from the ensemble of aligned molecules ...",

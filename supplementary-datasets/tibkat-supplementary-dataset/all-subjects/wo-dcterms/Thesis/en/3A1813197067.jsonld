            "abstract": "Nowadays, ionizing radiation is applied clinically for the treatment of various disorders. High doses of ionizing radiation are used in tumor therapy to particularly achieve local tumor control. On the other hand, low doses of ionizing radiation are well known for the induction of pain-relieving effects in chronic degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Apart from the targeted effects of ionizing radiation such as the induction of cell death, it is eminent today that ionizing radiation is also able to modulate the immune system. In this context, low and high doses have opposite effects, as low doses can ameliorate inflammatory processes, while high doses are able to stimulate immune responses and inflammation. Currently, therapeutic concepts aim to integrate and utilize the immunomodulatory effects of radiation to improve patient outcomes. Thus, a deeper understanding of the longitudinal immunological changes in patients during radiotherapy is beneficial to optimize these therapeutic concepts, as well as to unravel the modes of action and to define biomarkers. Hence, we perform a flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping assay in our laboratory that allows to distinguish more than 20 different immune cell types and their respective activation status from peripheral blood in order to analyze the immune status of patients in clinical trials. In parallel, we collect serum and plasma for the quantification of inflammatory mediators such as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Within the scope of this work, we longitudinally monitored and analyzed the immune status in three independent patient studies together with the analysis of different clinical parameters. Our first goal was to unravel the immunological modes of action of low doses of ionizing radiation on the immune system. Thus, we initiated the IMMO-LDRT01 trial in 2015, which focuses on the analysis of the immune status of patients receiving low dose radiation therapy (X--rays) for chronic degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Even though a plethora of ...",

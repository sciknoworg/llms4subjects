            "abstract": "Landslides are one of the biggest natural hazards in Georgia, a mountainous country in the Caucasus. So far, no systematic monitoring and analysis of the dynamics of landslides in Georgia has been made. Especially as landslides are triggered by extrinsic processes, the analysis of landslides together with precipitation and earthquakes is challenging. In this thesis I describe the advantages and limits of remote sensing to detect and better understand the nature of landslide in Georgia. The thesis is written in a cumulative form, composing a general introduction, three manuscripts and a summary and outlook chapter. In the present work, I measure the surface displacement due to active landslides with different interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods. The slow landslides (several cm per year) are well detectable with two-pass interferometry. In same time, the extremely slow landslides (several mm per year) could be detected only with time series InSAR techniques. I exemplify the success of InSAR techniques by showing hitherto unknown landslides, located in the central part of Georgia. Both, the landslide extent and displacement rate is quantified. Further, to determine a possible depth and position of potential sliding planes, inverse models were developed. Inverse modeling searches for parameters of source which can create observed displacement distribution. I also empirically estimate the volume of the investigated landslide using displacement distributions as derived from InSAR combined with morphology from an aerial photography. I adapted a volume formula for our case, and also combined available seismicity and precipitation data to analyze potential triggering factors. A governing question was: What causes landslide acceleration as observed in the InSAR data? The investigated area (central Georgia) is seismically highly active. As an additional product of the InSAR data analysis, a deformation area associated with the 7th September Mw=6.0 earthquake was found. Evidences of surface ruptures directly associated with the earthquake could not be found in the field, however, during and after the earthquake new landslides were observed. The thesis highlights that deformation from InSAR may help to map area prone landslides triggering by earthquake, potentially providing a technique that is of relevance for country wide landslide monitoring, especially as new satellite sensors will emerge in the coming years",

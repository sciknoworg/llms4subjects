            "abstract": "Metal halide perovskites (MHP) represent a class of low-cost and versatile ionic semiconductor materials that have the potential to enter and make a significant impact in the photovoltaic (PV) and sensor markets. Perovskite solar cells (PSC), made from MHP are a rapidly evolving class of next-generation PV devices. They have piqued the interest of the scientific community due to their rapidly improving performance, low production costs, and superior optoelectronic features such as strong light absorption, high charge mobility, and long carrier diffusion lengths. However, challenges like film and device processing reproducibility, defects (in the bulk and interfaces), scalability, device performance, and long-term stability are impeding the technology to enter the PV and sensor market. Hence, before considering large-scale production and commercialization, it is necessary to develop repeatable and optimal processing conditions. To this end, it is critical to set a detailed understanding linked to the chemistry of MHP precursor solutions, chemical composition, conversion of precursor solution into a thin film, crystallization process, and how to mitigate defects related to grain boundaries and interfaces. Several methods have been used to fabricate patterned MHP that can be used for sensor applications. However, because of the intrinsic properties of MHP, it is required to design easy, nondestructive, and compatible processing methods. In this thesis, the patterning of MHP was investigated. Photolithographically patterned silicon wafer was used to bake and pattern polymethylhdrosiloxane (PDMS) stamp. After the patterned side of the PDMS stamp was wetted with thiol solution, a gold-coated substrate was microcontact printed leading to a hydrophilic-hydrophobic contrast patterned substrate surface. Subsequent deposition of MHP precursor solution (s) on the patterned substrate resulted in the growth of a patterned array of MAPbBr3 poly- and single-crystals. Our non-destructive and energy-saving processing method will contribute to the growth of patterned MHPs in a periodic arrangement, which may be used to construct various types of optoelectronic devices and integrated electronic systems with more complicated architectures.",

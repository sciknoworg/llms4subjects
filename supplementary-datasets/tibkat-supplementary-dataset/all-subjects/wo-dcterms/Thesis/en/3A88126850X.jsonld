            "abstract": "A light-promoted nitrene transfer to sulfides and sulfoxides was described. The nitrene sources were 3-substituted 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones, compounds which decarboxylated under visible light irradiation. After decarboxylation, the formed nitrene species was coordinated by the catalyst [Ru(TPP)CO] and then transferred either to sulfides or to sulfoxides. The corresponding N acyl sulfilimines or sulfoximines were achieved in high yields. Motivated by these positive results, we developed a Ru(II)-catalyzed one-pot imidation/oxidation sequence. Starting from the sulfides, the corresponding N-acyl sulfilimines were formed under photochemical conditions and then oxidized by addition of sodium periodate. The ruthenium(II) complex was able to catalyze the two steps, and the corresponding N-acyl sulfoximines were obtained in good to high yields.Secondly, a new synthetic strategy toward methionine sulfoximine (MSO) was described. Starting from methionine, the amino and acidic functionalities were protected. Three different imidation procedures were then tested: 1) metal-free procedure, affording the corresponding N-cyano sulfilimine which could then be oxidized; 2) Fe(II)-catalyzed procedure, starting from the methionine sulfoxide and leading to the corresponding N-nosyl sulfoximine; 3) the one-pot Ru(II) catalyzed procedure, starting from the protected methionine in the presence of 3 methyl 1,4,2,-dioxazol-5-one, which provided the N-acetyl sulfoximine. After final deprotection, the target compound was obtained. The use of these protocols allowed the synthesis of MSO in good yields and under safer conditions than the ones already described in literature. The Ru(II) catalyzed method proved to be the most efficient and it was successfully applied to the syntheses of buthionine sulfoximine as well. The third project described in the thesis is about the syntheses of aza-analogs of sulforaphane, a chemoprotective sulfoxide bearing an isothiocyanate functionality and deriving from crucifer consumption. Starting from erucine (the corrensponding sulfide) or from sulforaphane itself, and applying the light-promoted Ru(II)-catalyzed imidation procedure, it was possible to obtain the N acetyl and the N-pentafluorobenzoyl sulfilimines and sulfoximines, respectively. Moreover, other imidation and oxidation conditions were tested with tert-butyl (4 (methylthio)butyl)carbamate. The resulting compounds were then stepwisely converted into isothiocyanates. In this way, the N-methyl, N-trifluoroacetyl, and N-carbamoyl sulfoximine analogs of sulforaphane were obtained in good yields.Finally, the synthesis of a sulfoximine analog of S Adenosyl L methionine (AdoMet) was detailed. A fully protected S Adenosyl L homocysteine was synthesized and several imidation conditions were tested. However, only poor results were obtained. Thanks to the studies performed on a model compound, the metal-free imidation followed by Ru(III)-catalyzed oxidation proved to be the strategy affording the best results. N-cyano sulfoximine was afforded in good yield. The final regeneration of the three functional groups involved the use of trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of triethylsilane as a cation scavenger. Because of the applied deprotection conditions, the N-cyano sulfoximine was converted into N-carbamoyl sulfoximine. In this way, the first sulfoximine analog of AdoMet was obtained.",

            "abstract": "The olfactory bulb (OB) is the only central processing station of the vertebrate olfactory system. It is assumed that odors are represented by a spatio-temporal code in the OB, with both the identity of the activated neurons and the temporal sequence of their activity patterns being stimulus-relevant parameters. An adequate investigation of these coding principles thus relies on the simultaneous recording of a large number of cells with a high temporal resolution. To date, few studies have been based on recordings of this type, and even less have attempted to investigate and quantify aspects of inter-neuronal dependencies in the odor evoked activity patterns. A fast confocal microscope was designed, built, characterized, and subsequently used to study inter-cellular dependencies in neuronal activity patterns, which would be obscured by inter-trial variability in successive single-cell recordings. Specifically, the onset times of odor-evoked activity in ensembles of mitral/tufted cells in the Xenopus larvae OB were investigated, visualized using the Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo-4. A novel measure, the inversion index, was introduced to quantify the similarity in the order of response onsets between pairs of stimulus applications ...",

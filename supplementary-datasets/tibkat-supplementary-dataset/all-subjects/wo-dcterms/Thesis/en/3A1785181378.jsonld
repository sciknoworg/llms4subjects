            "abstract": "In this thesis a concept for the synthesis of metal and boron complexes, based on the dipyrromethene structure, is presented. Specifically, meso-substituted dipyrromethanes and dipyrromethenes (dipyrrins) have been used for the synthesis of these complexes. The pentafluorophenyl and the 4 fluoro-3-nitrophenyl moiety enabled the selective functionalization of the related para-fluorine position with various nucleophiles (amines, alcohols, or thiocarbohydrates) via nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr). Dipyrromethanes were oxidized into the dipyrrins and enabled a targeted synthesis of the corresponding heteroleptic and homoleptic dipyrrinato complexes. Starting from the meso-substituted dipyrromethanes, a targeted synthesis of the respective boron-dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) was also successful. The dipyrrinato compounds presented in these projects are relevant for the development of photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). To investigate the (photo)toxic potential of the dipyrrinato complexes, the compounds were evaluated for their dark and phototoxicity in tumor cell and bacterial assays by employees of the biolitec research GmbH. Dipyrromethanes are important starting materials for the preparation of porphyrins, corroles, or other macrocyclic compounds. As well, dipyrromethanes are applied in the synthesis of BODIPYs and dipyrrinato metal complexes. In one project, meso-(4-amino-3-nitrophenyl)-substituted dipyrromethanes were investigated as suitable building blocks for the development of BODIPYs and dipyrrinato ruthenium(II) complexes. An efficient substitution of the para-fluorine of the 4-fluoro-3 nitrophenyl moiety was achieved with various amines via SNAr. The scope of suitable nucleophiles has also been extended to an azido group. Starting from these functionalized dipyrromethanes the corresponding BODIPYs were prepared. Furthermore, the pre-functionalized dipyrromethanes were oxidized to their respective dipyrrins and the subsequent synthesis of (p-cymene)(dipyrrinato)ruthenium(II) complexes ...",

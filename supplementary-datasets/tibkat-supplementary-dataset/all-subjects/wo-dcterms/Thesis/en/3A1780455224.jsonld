            "abstract": "Nanophotonic and chiral plasmonics are among nanotechnology's most intriguing and interdisciplinary fields and on the leap towards commercialisation. Chiral molecules are abundant in nature, our body and can even be found in the universe. The molecular handedness plays a significant role for their functions in many biological systems. Encoding chirality into plasmonics is promising as it can manipulate electromagnetic fields and enhance the sensitivity of chiral molecule detection. Simultaneously, the fields attract scientists from diverse backgrounds, with multiple interests such as physicists studying light-matter interaction, chemists catalysing enantiomer-selective reactions and biologists studying living objects and their mechanisms. However, the current state-of-the-art fabrication of such structures is often complex and requires sophisticated infrastructure. Robust and scalable platforms are therefore needed to provide users with suitable structures to work with in their environment. This doctoral thesis further expands the tool set of colloidal lithography and colloidal templating, as they allow to fabricate plasmonic nanostructures and sensors over large-areas. Plasmonic resonators focus electromagnetic waves into tiny volumes known as hot-spots, similarly to lenses, but beyond the diffraction limit. These regions govern plasmonic applications since they strongly enhance properties and signals from light-matter interaction. Hence, guiding molecules and particles towards to regions is a key for resilient and sensitive applications. A robust, minimalistic colloidal lithography concept was developed to specifically address these regions of high near-field enhancement on crescent-shaped and other nanoantennas. By employing a material contrast, it was possible to place molecules and nanoparticles in the hot-spot areas with an efficiency of 90%. Crescents are anisotropic and symmetric nanoantennas that also allow the achiral polarization-depended excitation of dipolar and quadrupolar resonances. However, ...",

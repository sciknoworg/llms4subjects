            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) cycling in Europe and in many other parts of the world has been massively accelerated as a result of agricultural and industrial activities in the last decades. As a consequence, forest ecosystems have been exposed to increasing deposition rates of reactive N, which may increase soil N availability. Increased N availability in turn may alter nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which play a major role in atmospheric chemistry and contribute to global warming. Several studies reported that European temperate forests receiving chronic high N depositions are important sources for N2O and NO. Despite high research efforts in the last two decades, there is still insufficient knowledge about the importance of N depositions and forest type on N oxide fluxes from temperate forest soils. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were (i) to investigate the origin of N oxide emissions from temperate forest soils exposed to chronic high N depositions and to quantify the contribution of N depositions and turnover of leaf litter N to N2O emissions and (ii) to determine the factors that regulate N oxide fluxes in temperate forest soils with special regard to the impact of forest type and soil gas diffusivity ...",

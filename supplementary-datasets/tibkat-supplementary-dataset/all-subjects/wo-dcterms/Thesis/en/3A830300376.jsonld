            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: The sample volumes handled in microfluidic devices are typically in the range of micro- to millilitres. This leads to spatially extended structures, which often cannot be manufactured in a cost-effective way by using established silicon/glass technologies. Therefore, microfluidic devices for cost-sensitive diagnostic applications are already realised solely on the basis of polymer materials. So far, there is no established alternative to silicon/glass technologies for the production of large-scale fluidic components with high aspect ratio microstructures and with high demands in terms of mechanical stability.An interesting example of combining such requirements is given by TopSpot printheads for printing of microarrays. The storage of up to 96 different biological samples in reservoirs with a capacity of typically 1 \u03bcl to 6 \u03bcl requires spatially extended microfluidic structures. At the same time, the 500 \u03bcm pitched microarray grid and the requirement to connect each nozzle to the corresponding reservoir by an individual supply channel demand for high integration density. Therefore, the fluidic channels have typical widths of 70 \u03bcm to 80 \u03bcm, depths of 80 \u03bcm to 300 \u03bcm \u2013 i.e. an aspect ratio of up to 4.3 \u2013 and the distance between two neighbouring channels in the nozzle array is only 55 \u03bcm to 180 \u03bcm. Currently, the fabrication process for TopSpot printheads is based on 100mm wafers and utilises deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of silicon and anodic bonding of the silicon to semi-finished glass wafers with fluidic inlets and outlets. These established technologies enable outstanding printing performance and long lifetime of the printheads but are related to high manufacturing costs, long lead times and are only little responsive in terms of application specific designs.The scientific challenge of this work is therefore to explore alternative material combinations and processes for realisation of the TopSpot printheads. A starting point is the analysis of the current fabrication process with respect to a set of criteria. The focus of the thesis is the reduction of the manufacturing costs and production lead time without any compromise in terms of performance and lifetime compared to the established silicon/glass printheads.A common way to reduce manufacturing costs is the reduction of the device dimensions and the transition to a larger wafer size. The underlying principle is that most fabrication processes take a fixed amount of t ...",

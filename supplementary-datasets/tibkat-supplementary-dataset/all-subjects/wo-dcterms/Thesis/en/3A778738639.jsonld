            "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the psychological construct of passion for activities, particularly on the conceptualization, measurement, stability and inter-individual variability of passion. A first paper reviews the literature about passion and related constructs and suggests a new definition of passion as an individual\u2019s coinciding desire and commitment towards an activity. The second paper of this thesis suggests a scale for the assessment of desire, commitment, and further more specific components of passion. This paper reports the psychometric properties, reliability and validity of the new scale, and tests central assumptions of the definition proposed in the first paper. The third paper investigated the relation of passion to specific facets of personality, particularly the sensitivity to reward and positive trait affectivity. Finally, the fourth paper investigated the stability of passion among adolescents across a period of two years, and disentangles the extents to which situation-specific and person-specific influences account for the observed variance in passion. The main findings of this thesis are: 1. Most psychological definitions of passion coincide in defining passion as a multifaceted construct that describes an individuals\u2019 coinciding experience of desire and commitment towards an activity, including the feeling of strong approach motivation, high arousal affect, continuous action plans pertaining to the activity, identification with the activity, and long-term goals referring to the activity. 2. Commitment is a central component of passion. The conducted studies support the definition of passion as coincidence of commitment and desire for activities. 3. The newly developed com.pass scale is a valid and reliable measure for the assessment of commitment, desire, and further specific components of passion. 4. Individuals differ in the degree to which they report feeling passionate about a particular activity. In a number of samples, two homogeneous groups of 1) highly passionate individuals and 2) lowly passionate individuals were found. 5. In contrast, the dual model of passion from Vallerand et al. (2003) was not supported in the studies of this thesis. There were strong correlations between the subscales of harmonious and obsessive passion. There were no homogeneous groups of either harmonious or obsessive individuals. Instead, the individuals\u2019 scores for these subscales of the dual model passion scale were either both high or both low. 6. Passion is positively correlated with affect- and reward-related personality traits, particularly with the sensitivity to reward and positive trait affectivity. 7. The likelihood of a person to experience many or few passionate situations (meaning the coincidence of commitment and desire) remains stable across a period of two years during adolescence both in terms of mean-level and rank-order stability. 8. Differences between everyday life activities account for 80% of the variance in momentary passion (meaning the coincidental experience of commitment and desire in a given situation). About 20% of the variance in passion are due to relatively stable inter-individual differences. This thesis contributes to the psychology of motivation an integration of previously separated research lines, definitions and measurements and new insights regarding situational and person-specific determinants for long-term commitment and affect-intense approach motivation towards activities.",

            "abstract": "Investigating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in the human cell has proven to be a long lasting endeavor that required the elaborate work of a few generations of scientists. Nowadays, interactome mapping approaches gain more and more interest as they not only deliver insights into the molecular processes which shape cell function and fate, but also represent a so far unexploited source of potential new therapeutic targets. The protein standing in the focus of my work is p97 and despite the great amount of literature describing its functional diversity, still not much is known how mutations in the p97 gene lead to the manifestation of a multisystem disorder called IBMPFD. Nevertheless, some publications reported perturbations in the p97 interaction network to be caused by disease-associated single amino acid exchanges in the protein. This suggests that there is a connection between disease onset or progression and the regulation of the p97 interactome. In order to test this hypothesis, I decided to follow a systematic approach and study in detail second order interaction partners of p97. My aim was to gather information about the mechanisms under their regulation and their disease relevance. One particularly good target for an investigation of this kind is the stable p97:ASPL complex. ASPL in human cells is predominantly present in a p97 bound state and finding ASPL interaction partners increases the chance of detecting complex binders. A SILAC analysis of immunoprecipitated endogenous ASPL and the following validation of its putative interaction partners by LuTHy revealed first indications of p97:ASPL being involved in processes related to pre-mRNA splicing. Three of the validated interaction partners of the complex are involved in the initiation of splicing and spliceosome assembly by recognizing the 3' splice site in intron sequences. These are the structural homologs PUF60, RBM39 and U2AF2. The interaction between U2AF2 and p97:ASPL is specific and the splicing factor appears to bind to a surface which is ...",

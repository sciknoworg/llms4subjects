            "abstract": "Intact polar lipids, IPL, lipid biomarker, Black Sea, marine sediment, lipid analysis, matrix effect, response factor, quantitative lipid analysis, Archaea, Bacteria, HPLC-MS, deep biosphere, GDGT, archaeol. - This PhD thesis focused on the analysis and application of microbial membrane lipids as biomarkers in marine sediments. Existing protocols for lipid extraction from marine sediments and biomass were modified. In addition, recent protocols based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) as well as state-of-the-art mass spectrometric analysis by quadrupole time-of-flight (MSqTOF) and the triple quadrupole (MSQQQ) mass spectrometer were used to investigate matrix effects and evaluate the reliability of quantitative analysis in marine environmental samples. The improved lipid extraction and quantification were used to analyze Black Sea water column and sediments samples to a depth of 8 meters from site GeoB 15105 taken during cruise M84/1 (DARCSEAS) with R/V Meteor to apply lipid analysis in benthic bio systems. With this component specific differentiation between planktonic and benthic lipid signature we assessed possible lipid sources. Here, this high detail lipid fingerprinting allowed us to observe changes in the head group and lipid core structures of the intact polar lipids according to the geochemical zonation.",

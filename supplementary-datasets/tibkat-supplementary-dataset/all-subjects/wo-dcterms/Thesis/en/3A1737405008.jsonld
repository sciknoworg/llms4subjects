            "abstract": "Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline hybrid materials with unique physical and chemical properties. The metal/metal oxide containing clusters are connected to organic lig-ands to form a wide variety of structures with exceptional properties such as ultrahigh porosity, tunable structure, and chemical stability. They are being investigated as potential materials for a variety of applications including gas storage, gas separation, catalysis, gas sensing and drug deliv-ery.<br>The thesis work has been focused on the synthesis, functionalization and characterization of dif-ferent MOFs and investigated for the applications in work function-based read-out gas sensors. So far, several MOFs were developed for chemical sensor applications especially the luminescent MOFs which have been potentially useful as chemically selective sensors. This thesis deals with the investigation of the MOF sensing layer for the detection of selective gases such as carbon dioxide and monohydric alcohols using the principle of contact potential changes.  <br><br>Firstly, the open metal sites M-MOF-74 (M= Mg, Ni, Co and Zn) and ethylene diamine function-alized M-MOF-74 were synthesized and investigated for CO2 gas sensors. For the first time MOF sensing layers have been investigated as selective CO2 gas sensing material at ambient tempera-ture with different humidity levels. This work investigated two kinds of MOFs by designing proper   open metal sites and introduce amine functional groups on MOFs for enhancing gas se-lectivity, sensitivity and long-term stability with respect to CO2 gas. The influence of humidity level on the target gas sensing were investigated and the possible reaction mechanism also dis-cussed. <br>Secondly, the open metal sites MOFs Zn-btc was synthesized and investigated for the detection of alkyl chain alcohol under both humid and dry air. This study discusses the reaction mechanism between the alcohol groups and MOFs. The signal of the work function depends on both the al-kyl chain length and the concentration of the alcohols and the host guest interaction was derived from crystal structure considerations. <br><br>Various characterization techniques were used to study the properties of these MOFs such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface area measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).  The results were used to discuss the ability of such mate-rial for real applications as gas sensors",

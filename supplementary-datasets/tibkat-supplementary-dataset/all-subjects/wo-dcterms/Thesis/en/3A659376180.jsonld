            "abstract": "New xanthenes with differently located azacrown ether residues were conceived and synthesized, and their spectral as well as calcium-binding properties evaluated. Three derivatives with an azacrown ether ring fused with a rhodol fluorophore were prepared (one  with a secondary amino group and the other two  with tertiary amino groups additionally bearing an ethyl group and an acetic acid residue). Also one derivative with the azacrown ether ring connected to the fluorophore was prepared. It was found, that the fluorescence signal of the sensor with an ethyl group at the nitrogen atom of the azacrown ether ring strongly increases in the presence of calcium (for [Ca2+] in the range of 5120 mM). As a part of this study, a synthetic route towards photoswitchable rhodol spiroamides was developed. By photoactivation under irradiation with UV light at 366 nm in toluene solution, these spiroamides gave transient fluorescent products. An effective route for the synthesis of N-methylphthalimide derivatives, fused at positions 4 and 5 with the aza-15-crown-5 ether moiety was developed ...",

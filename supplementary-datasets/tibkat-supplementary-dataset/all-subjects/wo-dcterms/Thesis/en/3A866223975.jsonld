                "Recent developments in methods and computational power render it possible to realistically simulate nanoscopic systems such as surfaces, two-dimensional materials, and nanodots including strong electronic correlations. Nanoscopic structuring enables the tailoring of the electronic structure which can be the basis of future electronic devices. This thesis addresses method developments and applications at the interface of ab-initio methods and model based many-body methods for the case of nanoscopically structured systems with strong correlations. In contrast to bulk materials, low-dimensional materials exhibit long-range interactions due to reduced screening. In this work, the general question how these long-range interactions affect electronic properties is investigated. To this end, a variational approach which approximates models with long-range interactions by models with only local interactions is introduced. For the case of an ab-initio derived model of graphene it is found that nonlocal interactions stabilize the semimetallic phase. The quality of this approach is discussed using a simple test case. Realistic models of interacting impurities embedded in an extended solid involve a large amount of bath sites and low symmetries regarding the impurity, which renders an exact treatment impossible. A variational algorithm is presented which optimizes corresponding exactly solvable effective models. Thus, the method is a proposition to an unambiguous solution of the so-called bath-discretization problem in exact diagonalization approaches to the Anderson impurity model. The method is benchmarked for a simple test case and applied to realistic models of Co atoms in Cu hosts and Fe atoms on alkali surfaces. Finally, the (001) surface of Cr is investigated by incorporating local correlation effects into a material realistic description derived from density functional theory. To this end, the LDA DMFT method is used to calculate spectral functions, which are compared to spectroscopic experimental data. So far open experimental features are thereby clarified. Cr(001) exemplifies a situation where correlation effects are determined by the geometric structure of a material: While correlations effects are weak in bulk Cr, they are key for the electronic structure of the Cr(001) surface."

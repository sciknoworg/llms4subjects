            "title": "Synaptic ultrastructure and regulation of synaptic transmission in Caenorhabditis elegans",
            "abstract": "The triggered release of synaptic vesicles (SVs) is tightly regulated in time and space by an elaborate network of proteins forming the active zone (AZ). When visualized by electron microscopy (EM), a morphological hallmark of the presynaptic AZ is an electron dense projection (DP) situated at the center of the AZ and extending into the cytoplasm. DPs are surrounded by a cluster of clear core SVs and have been proposed to play an important role in organizing and regulating SV release. However, our knowledge about its molecular composition, assembly mechanisms, and high-resolution 3D structure are limited. The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides an easily accessible model system to study AZ assembly, structure and function in regulated synaptic transmission. By using high-pressure-freeze (HPF) and freeze substitution (FS) EM in combination with tomography, I could show that C. elegans DPs are highly structured. DPs at cholinergic and GABAergic NMJs are branched, forming bay-like slots in which SV can usually be found docked to the AZ membrane. These bays thus may correspond to SV release sites. Large neuron-neuron synapse DPs appear to be polymers of the smaller NMJ DP unit with the same geometric arrangement of branch points and bays, indicating that DPs at functionally distinct synapses in C. elegans employ a common principle of structural assembly. To gain insights into the mechanisms that control synapse assembly, we analyzed the DP morphology in mutants lacking AZ proteins by HPF EM. Previous studies have proposed the C. elegans Liprin-a homolog synapse defective 2 (SYD-2) to be a key regulator in synapse formation by recruiting other synaptic proteins to nascent release sites. I demonstrate that SYD-2 together with a second AZ protein, ELKS-1, determines DP size in C. elegans NMJs. Whereas loss of SYD-2 results in significantly reduced DP size and inefficient vesicle recruitment, a gain-of-function (GF) mutation leads to the formation of elongated DPs. However, the ability of SYD-2 GF to promote DP elongation strictly depends on the presence of ELKS-1. A negative regulator of synapse formation, RSY-1, has recently been discovered to impair SYD-2 functionality ...",

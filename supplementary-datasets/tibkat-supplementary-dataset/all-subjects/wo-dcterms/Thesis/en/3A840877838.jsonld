            "title": "Four essays in empirical industrial organization",
            "abstract": "This dissertation comprises four essays in Empirical Industrial Organization. The unifying element of the four papers is the use of modern empirical methods in policy evaluation as well as behavioral economics. Three of the four essays are pure industry case studies of the automobile as well as the energy sector and one analyzes the behavior of students in a trust game. Following the introduction in chapter one, chapter two and three are concerned with the policy evaluation of car scrappage schemes in a worldwide context as well as an in-depth analysis of the German \u201cAbwrackpr\u00e4mie\u201d. Chapter two reveals that, compared to a simulated counterfactual, a positive overall effect of the Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Programs for selected countries are found using panel econometric techniques. Chapter three tries to shed more light on the winners and losers of the German car scrappage scheme, implemented in 2009, in terms of car market segments. Results of a time-series analysis suggest that the policy has been successful in creating additional demand for the small as well as the upper small car market segment and that the pull-forward effects are small in the first two years after the politically induced treatment. The contribution in chapter four tries to disentangle the influence factors of the diffusion of photovoltaic installations in Germany, using a fixed effects panel dataset from 2010 to 2012. Results suggest that the diffusion of photovoltaic installations hinges to a large extent on the electricity retail price, and not only on the governmentally set feed-in tariffs. This can also be interpreted as the self-consumption influence on photovoltaic investment and has not been shown in the literature until now. The last chapter, chapter five, analyses a trust game experiment. We are interested in the isolation of three personal characteristics on the experimental outcome: study progress, study major and gender. While economists are both significantly less trusting and less trustworthy than law students, this difference is largely due to differences between female law and economics students. While female law students are already different in nature (during the first term of study) from female economists, the gap between them also widens more drastically over the course of their study compared to their male counterparts. This finding is rather critical as the detailed composition of students is typically neglected in most experiments.",

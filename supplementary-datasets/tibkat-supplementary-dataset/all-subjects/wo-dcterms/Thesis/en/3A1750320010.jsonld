            "abstract": "Abstract: Why do we observe an increase of EU-China security cooperation over time, while at the same time, political tensions deepen? And why does cooperation emerge on some security issues but not on others? Although the main drivers of EU-China relations remain of an economic kind, meaning primarily concerns with trade, investment and intellectual property issues, the security dimension of the relationship has increased over time and has developed into a vital pillar of EU-China relations. While a lot has been written about EU-China economic affairs, their relationship in the security realm is a controversial and highly debated, yet under-researched issue. This dissertation examines the main drivers towards cooperation in EU-China security relations by applying a mixed comparison approach. Drawing on a combination of rationalist and constructivist explanatory factors it assesses the role of complex interdependence, economic interests, a convergent problem understanding and mutual perceptions in order to explain why EU-China security cooperation takes place despite deepening political tensions. A diachronic comparison investigates temporal patterns, revealing an increase of complex interdependence and a converging understanding of what constitutes security as the main drivers towards security cooperation over time. A synchronic comparison of three security issues, anti-terrorism, anti-piracy/maritime security and climate/energy security, further underlines these findings. In analyzing variation over time and between security issues, the present study provides a comprehensive assessment of EU-China security relations in the context of political tensions and shows why security cooperation takes place against all odds. It provides incentives for further in-depth process research on the roles of the EU and China in different security issues and has practical implications for the orientation of the EU\u2019s future China policy.",

            "abstract": "In the present study the function of Lissencephaly-1 protein in male germ cell differentiation was analysed. A gene trap mouse model (L39) in which a gene trap vector had integrated in intron 2 of Lis1 gene resulted in male infertility of homozygous L39GT/GT mice (Nayernia et al., 2003) and was further analysed in this study. Moreover, to study the gene trap mutation on different genetic backgrounds, namely CD-1, FVB, C57BL and 129/Sv, incipient congenic animals were generated. No differences between homozygous animals of different genetic backgrounds were found. Therefore a genetic background effect could be excluded. To confirm that the infertility of L39GT/GT males is due to the gene trap integration in Lis1 gene locus and to gain further insights into the role and requirement of LIS1 in spermatogenesis, a transgenic rescue approach was used. Three transgenic lines were generated, which overexpress Lis1 under the control of testis specific promoters. The promoters used were (i) hEF-1a promoter, which is exclusively active in spermatogonial cells, (ii) PGK2 promoter, which is active in pachytene spermatocytes and following stages of spermatogenesis, and (iii) TNP2 promoter, which is active in round spermatids and following stages of spermatogenesis ...",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an abundance of virulence factors that aid in the establishment of bacterial invasion and infection in mammalian host cells. In this work, we investigated the host cell membrane-associated proteins that interact with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) and its lectins, LecA and LecB. We used human lung epithelial cell line, H1299 as the cellular model for all the experiments as this bacterium is one of the major causes of severe lung infection. We found a novel cytoskeletal interaction partner of PAO1, namely the septin GTPases. When H1299 cells were infected with the pathogen, we observed cage-like as well as an amorphous ensemble of septins around it. We also found that knockdown (KD) or perturbation of septin function led to an increase in intracellular bacterial load. Additionally, we observed that septin function perturbation resulted in a significant reduction (\u226570%) of viable bacterial count in the cell culture supernatant after 4 h of bacterial stimulation. While the wild-type cells could restrict the infection by expelling the septin-caged bacterium out, the septin function perturbed cells were less efficient in doing so. Septins, therefore, have a protective role against PAO1 infection. We found another interaction partner of PAO1 via its galactose-binding lectin LecA in H1299 cells. We observed that LecA associated with flotillin-1, a lipid raft marker which performs the role of an endocytic molecule and an intracellular cargo trafficker. In addition, LecA and flotillin-1 co-immunoprecipitated\u2014 this prompted us to investigate lectin trafficking in the absence of flotillin-1. Knockout of flotillin-1 did not impair LecA binding or internalization, but induced marginal changes in trafficking and kinetics. However, the invasion of whole bacteria was reduced by 50% in the absence of flotillin-1. We also found two other interaction partners of the bacterium via its fucose-binding lectin, LecB. We performed preliminary investigations on LecB internalization and found the glycoprotein receptor\u2013CD44, a marker for CLIC/GEEC endocytic pathway to be associated with it. Since most pathogen interactions with the host cells require host cell binding and receptor clustering, we studied briefly the possibility of LecB mediated CD44 clustering at different time points using dSTORM microscopy. Preliminary investigation revealed that CD44 receptor clustering increased by ~2-fold and at the same time, the mean cluster size d ...",

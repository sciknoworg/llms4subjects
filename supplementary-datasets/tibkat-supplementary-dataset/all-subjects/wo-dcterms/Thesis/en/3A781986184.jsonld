            "abstract": [
                "Abstract: The Arctic has experienced a pronounced increase in air temperature over the last four decades, with an average increase of 0.4 \u02bfC per decade and thus an increase of almost the double rate than that of temperate regions. Remote sensing studies and repeat photography of historical images have shown large-scale increases of plant productivity in tundra ecosystems over the same time period. A pronounced size, abundance and biomass increase of shrubs has been observed. This so called shrub expansion has important repercussions for the vegetation, the animals, the soil, the energy and the carbon balance of the Arctic tundra and on regional and global climate. As the comparison of historical photographs with recent photographs has shown, this shrub expansion occurs on different temporal and spatial scales with areas of strong increase in shrub cover (expanding patches) and areas without noticeable changes in shrub vegetation (stable patches). While remote sensing approaches for the detection of changes in vegetation are limited in their temporal coverage and so far also in their resolution, historical photographs with high resolution are often not available. Experimental studies have shown that an increase in nutrients or temperature often resulted in increased shrub biomass, but findings were partly contradictory, referred to short term observations and usually confined to small areas. To bridge the gap between spatially limited plot-scale experiments and global ...",

            "abstract": "Protein synthesis is an important house-keeping activity of all the cells. It follows the same concepts in all three domains of life: the genetic code is deciphered and transcribed into the mRNA, which in turn is translated into the polypeptide by the help of the ribosome. Translation of proceeds through four steps: initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. Despite following the same concepts, different steps of translation show certain domain-specificities. One of the hall-marks of eukaryotic initiation, is the complex initiation step, requiring intricate interaction of several protein factors called eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). The largest eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF3, is a multi-subunit complex which serves as a scaffold to which other initiation factors bind. It facilitates mRNA recruitment and assembly of other initiation factors on the 40S ribosomal subunit. Its complex and flexible nature hinders its purification for structural and biochemical studies. The major part of the present work, which is presented in chapter two, was to establish a protocol for recombinant purification and in vitro assembly of Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF3. This complex was subjected to structural studies by single-particle electron microscopy ...",

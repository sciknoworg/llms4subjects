            "abstract": "Natural products have been used to combat infectious diseases since ages. However, increased resistance to existing antibiotics and emergence of new diseases stimulated the development of new medicines. Streptomycetes are a fruitful source for structurally diverse and bioactive secondary metabolites. In the present research work, twelve terrestrial Streptomyces strains were selected on the basis of their biological activities and a chemical prescreening. The strains with interesting properties were cultured under standard conditions and extracted with different solvents or adsorbed on resins. A series of chromatographic techniques (silica gel columns, Sepha-dex LH-20, PTLC and HPLC) were applied to deliver pure compounds which were identified as new or known metabolites by a dereplication process. The structures of new compounds were fully elucidated by various spectroscopic methods (NMR, mass, UV, IR) and finally sent for biological tests, as for antimicrobial and anticancer activities, etc. From the extracts of selected strains, 66 compounds were isolated belonging to different groups like macrolides, quinones, glycosides, peptides etc. Among them, 18 compounds can be considered as new secondary meta-bolites. The new dehydrorabelomycin-1-O-a-L-rhamnopyranoside showed potent antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli.",

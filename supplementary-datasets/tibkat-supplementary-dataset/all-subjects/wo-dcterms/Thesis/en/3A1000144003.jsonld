            "title": "Metabolic adaptation of Streptococcus suis to different environments",
            "abstract": "Streptococcus (S.) suis is a zoonotic pathogen that can cause severe pathologies such as meningitis, septicemia, and endocarditis in pigs as well as in humans. It is proposed that the establishment of invasive diseases depends not only on the regulation of virulence factors but also on the expression of metabolic genes, since S. suis needs to efficiently adapt to environmental stimuli such as different nutrients in specific host habitats such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, this study focused on the identification and characterization of metabolic pathways presumably important for the biological fitness of S. suis under different environmental conditions. The study is divided into four main results parts. In the first part (Chapter 3) amino acid auxotrophies of S. suis were determined and de novo amino acid biosynthesis of S. suis under chemically defined in vitro conditions by 13C-isotopologue profiling analyzed in order to elucidate the core metabolic pathways. These analyses were also applied under more complex conditions, i.e. porcine blood and CSF. In general, highest 13C enrichments were observed in Ala, Asp, Ser, and Thr under in vitro conditions indicating predominant glucose catabolization by the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway. Lower relative labeling rates of aromatic amino acids (Tyr and Phe) revealed a minor contribution of the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) in glucose metabolism. Furthermore, results indicate a preferred uptake of some amino acids from the environment instead of utilizing de novo biosynthesis. Overall, similar results were obtained in porcine CSF and porcine blood indicating a stable EMP pathway independent of the environment. Analysis of metabolic pathways in S. suis is hampered by the lack of efficient mutagenesis systems and, therefore, a Cre-lox based mutagenesis technique for gene deletion in S. suis was established. The advantage of this method is the utilization of a counter selectable marker which can subsequently be removed by a Cre recombinase in order to avoid side effects on the expression of downstream or upstream located genes. This recombinase recognizes specific DNA (loxP sites) and removes the selectable marker which is flanked by two loxP sites. As described in Chapters 4 and 5, it could be shown that this technique allowed the inactivation of complete operons consisting of several genes. In the third part (Chapter 5), the metabolic adaptation of S. suis to porcine blood and CSF ex vivo was investigated on a gene expression level. Remarkably, the most differentially expressed genes during growth of S. suis in blood were associated with carbohydrate metabolism and transport, for example, several phosphotransferase systems in comparison to gene expression in THB medium. This suggested the uptake of various carbohydrates by S. suis. Comparison of our results with a previous study revealed that the regulation of the PPP and carbohydrate transporter systems increases with the time of incubation. After proliferation of S. suis in CSF, especially genes involved in protein translation as well as amino acid biosynthesis and - uptake were differentially expressed. The increased expression of these genes could be explained by a consumtion by S. suis of associated amino acids from the CSF. As a consequence S. suis might initiate biosynthesis of these amino acids in addition to their uptake. Inactivation of selected metabolic genes by Cre-lox mutagenesis did not show phenotypical differences between the mutant and the wildtype strain. Thus, to detect essential genes for S. suis fitness in the tested host environments further investigations are needed. In order to adapt its metabolism to different conditions in the host, S. suis might also rely on transcriptional regulators that directly or indirectly sense environmental changes and modulate the expression of metabolic genes. Thus, in the fourth part (Chapter 6) the function of a putatively oxygen-sensing FNR-like protein of S. suis, FlpS was analyzed. By growth experiments, transcriptome analysis, isotopologue profiling and mice infection experiments it was found that FlpS is an oxygen-sensing regulator essential for the expression of arcABC encoding for the arginine deiminase system, which plays a role in protection against acidic stress and provides energy in form of ATP. Furthermore, FlpS seems to be important for the regulation of several metabolic genes. In conclusion, results of the present study provide novel insights into the adaptation of S. suis to host environments which might contribute to our understanding of infection processes and can help to develop better strategies for control of S. suis infections.",

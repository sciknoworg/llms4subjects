            "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the question of the impact of glyphosate formulation on Salmonella enterica isolates in context of animal health and environmental hygiene. Within a screening of 225 S. enterica isolates from farm animals, a change in susceptibility within the last three decades became visible. Different susceptibility against glyphosate was found between different serovars and host animals. In general, the screening revealed higher MIC in isolates that were isolated in the last years. Also, higher MICs were found in pigs compared to poultry and cattle and the serovar Typhimurium had a higher MIC compared to Enteritidis and Infantis. This was the case not only for glyphosate as a pure substance but also for the formulation Roundup LB plus. In an in vitro fermenter experiment, we investigated whether this generally higher glyphosate tolerance in S. enterica lead to a better survival within cattle intestine e.g. rumen. Therefore, we performed an experiment with rumen simulation technic and infected fermenter vessels with S. enterica. Afterwards we challenged half of the vessels with RU, re-isolated S. enterica, counted them and determined the MIC to RU of the re-isolates. It turned out, that RU had no impact on survival time of S. enterica in fermenter, that no change of MIC within experiment took place and that no cross-resistance to antibiotics occurred. In laboratory experiments we finally investigated if it is possible to generate glyphosate resistance in S. enterica via a long-term evolution experiment. We challenged the pathogen with sub-lethal concentrations of RU. It was not easy to decrease sensitivity in S. enterica isolates and many days were needed. In the end, three isolates were selected due to a two to four times higher MIC after the experiment. Of these isolates, the whole genome was sequenced. Comparisons with sequenced ancestral strains revealed mutations in the aroA gene and close regions, but also revealed mutations in genes for stress response. In a fitness essay, no fitness ...",

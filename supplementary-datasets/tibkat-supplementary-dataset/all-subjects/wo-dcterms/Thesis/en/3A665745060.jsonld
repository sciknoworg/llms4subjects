            "abstract": "In order to effectively plan and manage the water resources of a country or geographical region, available water resources must be quantitatively assessed and hydrological processes must be known. Although surface water is ordinarily considered a primary source of water, the Middle Eastern focus has been primarily on groundwater. Attention to surface water, runoff generation processes, and overall catchment modelling has typically been paid little attention. However due to hydrological conditions and population increase, countries like Jordan are considering the entire spectrum of water resources and the quantitative assessment and characterization of hydrological resources are becoming ever more important. Hydrological modelling in the arid to semi arid catchment of Wadi Kafrein (161 km\u00f8) was the objective of this study, and in order to complete this objective, detailed hydrological investigations were performed there. The catchment is characterized by a wide range of climatic differences, topographic variations, and spatial land uses. A physically based, spatially distributed, hydrological model was prepared within the framework of this dissertation. The aim of this dissertation is a detailed quantification of the water balance of the study area with emphasis on (1) runoff generation mechanisms and (2) the resulting transmission losses. A secondary aim of this study was for the model to assist local decision makers in solving water resources management problems ...",

            "abstract": "Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (pAmpC) producing bacteria are frequently detected in the broiler production chain. Investigations revealed a high prevalence of ESBL- and pAmpC- producing bacteria throughout the broiler fattening process up to the slaughterhouse level and consumer goods and revealed several transmission routes of these antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Insights into the colonization dynamics of broiler chickens and possible intervention measures are needed as the transmission of ESBL- and pAmpC- producing bacteria to humans via close contact with livestock or the consumption of contaminated meat is assumed. This thesis aimed to determine the minimal bacterial count necessary to colonize broiler chickens with ESBL- and pAmpC- producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) and to establish a broiler chicken colonization model (seeder-bird) close to real farming conditions without applying any antimicrobial selection pressure. Subsequently, we aimed to evaluate distinct intervention measures on their potential to reduce the colonization of broiler chickens with ESBL- and pAmpC- producing E. coli throughout the fattening process. For the determination of the minimal bacterial count, ESBL- and pAmpC- negative day-old broiler chickens (Ross 308) were kept under conventional conditions and were orally co-inoculated on day three of the trial with 10^4,10^3, 10^2, or 10^1 colony forming units (cfu) of one ESBL- (CTX-M-15) and one pAmpC- (CMY-2) producing E. coli strain in separate trials. All investigated bacterial counts led to the colonization of all broiler chickens in the trials, with all broiler chickens tested positive after 24 h (10^4-10^2 cfu) or 72 h (10^1 cfu) post inoculation (p.i.) up to the end of each trial. At necropsy (14 d p.i.), the cecal colonization with the ESBL- and pAmpC- producing E. coli strains of all investigated bacterial counts showed equivalence in the statistical analysis. To assure stable colonization, the bacterial count of 10^2 cfu ...",

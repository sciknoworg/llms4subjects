Hence, the reconstruction of past climate variability is a valuable way to understand mechanisms of present climatic changes. In front of the Senegal River, in a mid-shelf position, lies a fine-grained depocenter. The investigation of this mud-belt depocenter forms the central theme of this thesis. Mud belts are believed to potentially be natural archives which record such variations. Continental shelves are very dynamic areas where the climatic signal recorded in the sediments may possibly be distorted by several factors. The first phase of this study investigated how the terrigenous fraction of a sediment sequence records past climate variability, specifically, which chemical elements can be employed to reconstruct climate variability off Senegal. We approached this problem with a combination of existing sedimentological techniques to unravel fluvial and aeolian sediment input. The second phase was to reconstruct the hydrological changes occurring during the late Holocene and compare them to several other records from NW-Africa. The third phase was to determine the influence of coastal and paleoclimatic changes on the Senegal mud-belt formation, specifically, to determine to what extent the climatic signal recorded by several sedimentological proxies is disrupted by the coastal changes. Then, the fourth phase of this study involved data collection on the initiation and evolution of the mud belt with the aim of reconstructing the history of this fine-grained shelf depocenter. The new scientific outcomes of this thesis are: (1) the identification of Fe and Al as being the most suitable fluvial proxies off Senegal, implying that specific chemical elements with which to record input variations must be determined ...",

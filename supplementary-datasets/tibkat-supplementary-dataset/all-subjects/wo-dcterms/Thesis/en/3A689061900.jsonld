            "title": "Detection of new allotypic variants of bovine antibody [lamda]-light chain and IgG-heavy chain constant regions",
            "abstract": "In the cattle breeds German Black Pied (GBP), German Simmental (GS), Holstein Friesian (HF) and Aubrac (A) the transcribed [lamda]-light chain (IG[lamda]) and the IgG heavy immunoglobulin chains (IgG) were analyzed. For this, blood samples were collected from ten randomly selected animals for each breed. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood B-cells and transcribed into cDNA. Using gene-specific primers, both the IG[lamda] and the IgG heavy chain were amplified. 16 clones/animal were sequenced for each chain and analyzed. The constant regions were separated and compared with database entries. For the definition of new allotypic variants of the position of the substitutions on the surface of the molecule was essential. The amino acid sequences were compared with known crystal structures of human and murine antibodies and creates a 3-dimensional model. For the two transcribed IG[lamda] isotypes three allotypic variants of the IG[lamda]C2 isotype, and five allotypic variants of the IG[lamda]C3 isotypes have been identified. In the case of the IgG-heavy chain, four known allotypic variants of IgG1, two allotypic variants of IgG2 and one allotypic variant of IgG3 detected. In addition, a new allotypic variant of IgG1, which was defined by 3D structure analysis. Allotypic differences in bovine IgG may influence the effector function of the antibody molecule.",

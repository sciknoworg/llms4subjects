            "abstract": "Mars is one of the best candidates among planetary bodies for supporting life. The presence of water in the form of ice and atmospheric vapour together with the availability of biogenic elements and energy are indicators of the possibility of hosting life as we know it. The occurrence of permanently frozen ground \u2013 permafrost, is a common phenomenon on Mars and it shows multiple morphological analogies with terrestrial permafrost. Despite the extreme inhospitable conditions, highly diverse microbial communities inhabit terrestrial permafrost in large numbers. Among these are methanogenic archaea, which are anaerobic chemotrophic microorganisms that meet many of the metabolic and physiological requirements for survival on the martian subsurface. Moreover, methanogens from Siberian permafrost are extremely resistant against different types of physiological stresses as well as simulated martian thermo-physical and subsurface conditions, making them promising model organisms for potential life on Mars.The main aims of this investigation are to assess the survival of methanogenic archaea under Mars conditions, focusing on methanogens from Siberian permafrost, and to characterize their biosignatures by means of Raman spectroscopy, a powerful technology for microbial identification that will be used in the ExoMars mission. For this purpose, methanogens from Siberian permafrost and non-permafrost habitats were subjected to simulated martian desiccation by exposure to an ultra-low subfreezing temperature (-80\u00baC) and to Mars regolith (S-MRS and P-MRS) and atmospheric analogues. They were also exposed to different concentrations of perchlorate, a strong oxidant found in martian soils. Moreover, the biosignatures of methanogens were characterized at the single-cell level using confocal Raman microspectroscopy (CRM).The results showed survival and methane production in all methanogenic strains under simulated martian desiccation. After exposure to subfreezing temperatures, Siberian permafrost strains had a faster metabolic recovery, whereas the membranes of non-permafrost methanogens remained intact to a greater extent. The strain Methanosarcina soligelidi SMA-21 from Siberian permafrost showed significantly higher methane production rates than all other strains after the exposure to martian soil and atmospheric analogues, and all strains survived the presence of perchlorate at the concentration on Mars. Furthermore, CRM analyses revealed remarkable differences in the overall chemical composition of permafrost and non-permafrost strains of methanogens, regardless of their phylogenetic relationship. The convergence of the chemical composition in non-sister permafrost strains may be the consequence of adaptations to the environment, and could explain their greater resistance compared to the non-permafrost strains. As part of this study, Raman spectroscopy was evaluated as an analytical technique for remote detection of methanogens embedded in a mineral matrix.This thesis contributes to the understanding of the survival limits of methanogenic archaea under simulated martian conditions to further assess the hypothetical existence of life similar to methanogens on the martian subsurface. In addition, the overall chemical composition of methanogens was characterized for the first time by means of confocal Raman microspectroscopy, with potential implications for astrobiological research.",

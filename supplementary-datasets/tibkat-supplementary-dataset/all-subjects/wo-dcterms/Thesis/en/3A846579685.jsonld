            "title": "Elliptic problems with small parameter",
            "abstract": "In this thesis we consider diverse aspects of existence and correctness of asymptotic solutions to elliptic differential and pseudodifferential equations. We begin our studies with the case of a general elliptic boundary value problem in partial derivatives. A small parameter enters the coefficients of the main equation as well as into the boundary conditions. Such equations have already been investigated satisfactory, but there still exist certain theoretical deficiencies. Our aim is to present the general theory of elliptic problems with a small parameter. For this purpose we examine in detail the case of a bounded domain with a smooth boundary. First of all, we construct formal solutions as power series in the small parameter. Then we examine their asymptotic properties. It suffices to carry out sharp two-sided \\emph{a priori} estimates for the operators of boundary value problems which are uniform in the small parameter. Such estimates failed to hold in functional spaces used in classical elliptic theory. To circumvent this limitation we exploit norms depending on the small parameter for the functions defined on a bounded domain. Similar norms are widely used in literature, but their properties have not been investigated extensively. Our theoretical investigation shows that the usual elliptic technique can be correctly carried out in these norms. The obtained results also allow one to extend the norms to compact manifolds with boundaries. We complete our investigation by formulating algebraic conditions on the operators and showing their equivalence to the existence of a priori estimates. In the second step, we extend the concept of ellipticity with a small parameter to more general classes of operators. Firstly, we want to compare the difference in asymptotic patterns between the obtained series and expansions for similar differential problems. Therefore we investigate the heat equation in a bounded domain with a small parameter near the time derivative. In this case the characteristics touch the boundary at a finite number of points. It is known that the solutions are not regular in a neighbourhood of such points in advance. We suppose moreover that the boundary at such points can be non-smooth but have cuspidal singularities. We find a formal asymptotic expansion and show that when a set of parameters comes through a threshold value, the expansions fail to be asymptotic. The last part of the work is devoted to general concept of ellipticity with a small parameter. Several theoretical extensions to pseudodifferential operators have already been suggested in previous studies. As a new contribution we involve the analysis on manifolds with edge singularities which allows us to consider wider classes of perturbed elliptic operators. We examine that introduced classes possess a priori estimates of elliptic type. As a further application we demonstrate how developed tools can be used to reduce singularly perturbed problems to regular ones.",

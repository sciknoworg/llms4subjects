            "abstract": "The pursuit of externally controlling receptors and enzymes led to the emergence of a field entitled photopharmacology. Its main target is to spatiotemporally control receptors and other target proteins with light using photosensitive ligands. This concept is based on an example from nature, bovine rhodopsin, which mediates vision in vertebrates. Bovine rhodopsin is a prototypic receptor for the superfamily of class A G Protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and even the first GPCR for which an X-ray crystal structure became available. Comparable to rhodopsin as the prototypical GPCR for light-activatable receptors, the beta2 adrenoceptor is the prototypical ligand-based GPCR. It was the first diffusible-ligand binding GPCR for which an X-ray crystal structure was resolved.55 Activation of the beta2 adrenoceptor leads to smooth muscle relaxation, predominantly in the respiratory tract but also in the uterus and the vascular system.56 Due to their effects in the respiratory tract, beta2 agonists have a substantial pharmacological relevance in the treatment of respiratory diseases, especially asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).56-58 With crystal structures, we have static pictures of the different states a receptor can adapt depending on the bound ligand. Yet, we do not fully understand the process of how a receptor changes from one state to another. This is due to a harder elucidation of the dynamics and kinetics of these changes between conformations. This work aimed to synthesize and biologically evaluate tools that could be used for a deeper investigation of the dynamics and kinetics of receptor activation and inactivation. This tool was designed as a ligand combining the advantages of photopharmacology and covalent binding. These light activatable ligands would enable an instantaneous and externally controlled receptor switch between its inactive and active state. ; Das Bestreben, Rezeptoren und Enzyme extern zu steuern, f\u00fchrte zur Entstehung eines Fachgebiets namens Photopharmakologie.

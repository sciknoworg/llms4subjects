            "abstract": "The lemurs of Madagascar are the evolutionary endpoints of a spectacular primate adaptive radiation and provide a unique opportunity to study convergent evolution in social organization. According to sexual selection theory and the socioecological model, where females form small groups, single males should monopolize access to these groups of females while excluding potential rivals from group membership as has been shown for many anthropoid species. The social organization of lemurs deviates from expectations derived based on these theoretical frameworks as males do not exclude rival males from group membership resulting in even or male-biased sex ratios in group composition. Moreover, although male-male competition for access to receptive females is intense, sexual dimorphism is absent among the lemurs. I studied nine habituated groups of Verreaux&rsquo;s sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) using continuous focal observations and fecal sample collection for female hormone analysis in order to address questions related to male reproductive strategies. The main results of this study revealed that females residing in the same social groups come into estrous asynchronously and that dominant males may be able to monopolize each female via the use of mate-guarding. These proximate mechanisms may thus explain the high reproductive skew in favor of dominant males observed for the study population ...",

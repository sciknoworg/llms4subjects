            "abstract": "Semiconductors, materials in which the charge transport can be well controlled, are at present invaluable ingredients in the emerging field of information technology. The elemental modules for information processing are field-effect transistors (FETs), which are semiconductor switching devices where the charge is manipulated by an external electric field. On the other hand, information storage requires the use of the electron spin. While the concept of magnetic recording has been known for a long time, the discovery of the GMR-Effect was a milestone which showed that the electron transport can be indeed controlled through the spin state of the conducting electrons. That was the beginning of a new research field in solid-state physics, which combines both charge and spin of the electrons, called Spintronics. If the integration of the spin functionality in semiconductor structures is performed in a reliable and efficient way, the advantages from the \"`magnetic world\" ' such as programmability or non-volatility, could be added to the well established semiconductor device technology. The achievement of magnetic semiconductors with robust magnetic properties at room-temperature, combined with semiconductor channels with long spin coherence times, seems to be the perfect solution to design high-performance, all-semiconducting spintronic devices ...",

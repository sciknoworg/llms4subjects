IPL analysis is a relatively new tool in microbial ecology to study (i) live microbial biomass and (ii) the dominating microbial players. This technique was applied for the first time to study the oxic and anoxic water column of the Black Sea and observed a stratification of IPLs according to geochemical zonation. Export of IPLs to the sediment was found to be selective and the distribution of IPLs in the upper 2 cm of the sediments reflects de novo production of IPLs by indigenous microbes, putatively identified as sulfate-reducing bacteria and benthic archaea. The distribution of archaeal IPLs in the anoxic water body did not indicate the abundant presence of methanotrophic archaea, which were presumed in earlier studies due to high estimated methane oxidation rates. The presence of betaine lipids and glycosidic sphingolipids in the anoxic water column could be linked to unknown anaerobic bacteria and is a novel finding as these lipids are primarily known to be produced by eukaryotes. Investigations of microbial communities associated to the Chapopote asphalt seep in the southern Gulf of Mexico revealed the presence of a diverse array of IPLs from both Bacteria and Archaea. IPL concentrations in the sediments were correlated with the abundant presence of oil and methane, indicating that the petroleum hydrocarbons are a major stimulant for microbial activity. Bacterial IPL concentrations decreased with decreasing sulfate concentrations over depth, whereas archaeal IPLs increased simultaneously and comprised up to 80% of total IPLs at ca. 15 cm sediment depth. Bacterial lipids mainly included phospholipids with the polar head groups phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl-(N)-methylethanolamine (PME), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The assignment of these IPLs to sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was confirmed by the presence ...",

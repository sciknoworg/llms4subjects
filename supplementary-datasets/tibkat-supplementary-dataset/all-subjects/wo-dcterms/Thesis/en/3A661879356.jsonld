            "abstract": "In the baker&rsquo;s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcriptional activator Gcn4p is the central element of the &lsquo;general amino acid control&rsquo; network that induces more than 500 genes in response to amino acid limitation. The amount of Gcn4p in the cell is mainly regulated by a translational mechanism and via control of its stability. The high instability of Gcn4p in sated cells is due to its rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway which is initiated by phosphorylation through the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85p in association with the cyclin Pcl5p. Pcl5p is a nuclear localized protein and its nuclear translocation depends on its C terminus and was suggested to be mediated by the \u00df importin Kap95p. The amino acid-dependent stabilization of Gcn4p in starved cells requires the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Pho81p and another cyclin, Pcl7p. It was suggested that the initial step of the Gcn4p stabilization is the dissociation of the Pho 85p/Pcl5p complex. In the course of this study it was shown that the C-terminus of Pcl5p comprises a non-classical NLS that requires a motif of basic amino acids flanked by a proline and an aspartic acid residue. The translocation of Pcl5p into the nucleus depends on a direct interaction with the \u00df importin Kap95p. Truncated versions of Pcl5p and Pcl5p/Pho80p hybrids were used for interaction studies to identify regions of Pcl5p responsible for the assembly/disassembly of Pho85/Pcl5p and Pho81p/Pcl5p complexes in sated and starved cells, respectively ...",

            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: In this thesis we investigate the production of a massive weak vector boson W \u00b1 or Z in association with a photon, where the vector boson decays leptonically. This type of processes is particularly interesting, since it allows to test the non-Abelian couplings of the EW gauge bosons. Furthermore, the channel pp \u2192 Z\u03b3 \u2192 l + l \u2212 \u03b3 is the main background to the Higgs-decay channel pp \u2192 h \u2192 Z\u03b3, and V\u03b3 (V = W, Z) production is an important background for various new-physics searches. In this thesis we present the calculation of the full NLO QCD+EW corrections. Therefore, we first reproduce the well known NLO QCD corrections. The EW corrections are calculated including the decay of the massive vector boson and taking into account all off-shell effects. The finite widths of the W and the Z boson are implemented by using the complex-mass scheme. Contributions from photon-induced channels are also taken into account applying up-to-date photon PDFs. Considering the fact that electrons and muons have different signatures in the detectors we present results for dressed leptons and bare muons. Calculating NLO corrections infra red divergences appear during the numerical integration of the real corrections. These divergences cancel against their counterparts in the virtual corrections as dictated by the KLN theorem. In order to extract the infra red divergences from the real corrections, we apply a so-called dipole subtraction algorithm allowing for a proper numerical integration of the real corrections. Separating hard photons from collinear jets, a quark-to-photon fragmentation function in combination with so-called democratic clustering  \u0301a la Glover and Morgan is employed. As an alternative we also apply Frixione\u2019s isolation scheme. Finally, anomalous Z\u03b3V (V = W, Z) and WW\u03b3 couplings are implemented at the level of NLO QCD. We present integrated cross sections for the LHC at 7 TeV, 8 TeV, and 14 TeV. Furthermore, we show differential distributions at 14 TeV with and without anomalous couplings and discuss the different types of relative corrections. The impact of EW corrections on differential distributions can reach several 10% in certain distributions due to so-called Sudakov logarithms, while their impact on integrated cross sections is of the order of a few percent. In contrast, the QCD corrections are huge in integrated cross sections as well as in differential distributions",

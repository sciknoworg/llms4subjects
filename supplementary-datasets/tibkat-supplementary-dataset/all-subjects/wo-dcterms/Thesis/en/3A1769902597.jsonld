            "abstract": "Certain members of the highly conserved chloride channel regulator, calcium-activated (CLCA) family have been implicated in inflammatory mucus-based respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cystic fibrosis which may either occur naturally or may be experimentally induced in animal species to model the respective human disease. CLCA1, the most intensively investigated member of this family to date, was shown to be highly expressed in these respiratory diseases and had been discussed as a therapeutic target. The CLCA family has been systematically characterized in naive and diseased conditions in humans and mice, and, to a lesser extent, in horses and naive pigs. It has not only revealed strong similarities but also distinct species-specific differences in genetic organization or protein structure and expression pattern, with partially functional contradictory results, particularly between human and murine CLCA orthologs. These interspecies differences are further complicated by possible redundancies or compensatory effects of homologous CLCA members and may limit the value of mouse models. Hence, caution is warranted in translating results from one species to another. Asthma is a highly relevant and naturally occurring disease not only in horses but also in cats, in which it shares many characteristics with the human disease. The feline CLCA family is, however, unknown to date. Hence, this study aimed at characterizing the gene and protein structure of the CLCA family in comparison to the orthologs of other well-investigated species, i.e. humans, mice, and pigs. Furthermore, it aspired at elucidating the mRNA and protein expression profile of feline CLCA members in healthy cats for the first time, particularly in the respiratory tract. Last but not least, it aimed gathering first evidence of allegedly differential expressional regulation of CLCA1 in feline asthma. It could be shown that the feline CLCA orthologs are grouped into four clusters, identical to all other species ...",

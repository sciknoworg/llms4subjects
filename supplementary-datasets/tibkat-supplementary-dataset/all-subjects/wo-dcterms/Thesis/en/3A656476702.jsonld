            "abstract": "Effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning in forests ecosystems are of increasing interest. There is a vital debate about the influence of species numbers and plant functional traits for different ecosystem functions such as primary productivity, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Only few studies on biodiversity effects were conducted in natural forest, despite their ecological and socioeconomic importance. Here we studied 12 forest stands in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Central Germany). The general objectives of this comparative study were (i) to quantify aboveground tree biomass and nutrient content, (ii) to assess total stand and species-specific productivity, and (iii) to examine decomposition rates and nutrient release patterns. The focus was to find and understand relations between tree species diversity and ecosystem functions such as productivity, decomposition and nutrient release. Studied forest stands grew on similar soils (physical properties) and bedrock and differentiated by a gradient of increasing tree species from pure beech forest stands (Fagus sylvatica), to medium-diverse forests built by beech, ash (Fraxinus excelsior), and lime (Tilia cordata and T. platyphyllos), and to highly-diverse stands dominated by beech, ash, lime, maple (Acer pseudoplatanus and A. platanoides), and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus). Stem wood increment in 2006 and 2007 was measured using permanent measurement tapes. Leaf and fruits biomass from 2005 to 2007 were collected with litter samplers and a litterbag experiment was conducted over 22 months to obtain litter, lignin and nutrient release rates.",

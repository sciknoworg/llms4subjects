            "abstract": "The cellular genome is constantly exposed to harmful endogenous and exogenous factors. Unrepaired DNA lesions and mismatches promote genomic instability, a major cause of cancer. Therefore, the prompt recognition and repair of damaged DNA, and the senescence or elimination of cells with persistent damage, are crucial to preserve genomic stability and suppress transformation. These processes depend on a cascade of phosphorylations known as the DNA damage response. The phosphorylation of histone H2Ax on Ser139 is one of the earliest events upon activation of the cascade, and the phosphorylated histone, ?H2Ax, serves as a marker of the damaged chromatin areas. Several kinases initiate the signal from the sites of the damage and transduce it to effector proteins, such as the tumor suppressor p53. The activation of p53 induces cell cycle arrest via the increased transcription of the Cdk inhibitor p21, and it promotes apoptosis mainly via the transcription of proapoptotic genes. The balance of phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated proteins regulate most of the known steps in the DNA damage response. Thus phosphatases are expected to act as modulators of this cascade; however, our knowledge regarding their precise role is very limited ...",

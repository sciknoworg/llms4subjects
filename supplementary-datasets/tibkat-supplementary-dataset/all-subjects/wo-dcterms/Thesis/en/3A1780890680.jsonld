            "abstract": "In this thesis, the functionalization of metal oxide nanoparticles with tailor made molecular building blocks and the properties and applications of the resulting nanoparticle (NP) hybrids were studied. Initially, a strong attachment of a first ligand shell is achieved through covalent binding of anchoring groups like carboxylic or phosphonic acids to the metal oxide surface. This first ligand shell then provides stability against agglomeration and growth, as well as unique properties like dispersibility in specific solvents, reactivity or molecular recognition. Based on this general approach, three different projects focusing on self-assembly of nanoparticles via solvophobic interactions, postfunctionalization of self-assembled monolayers via hydrogen bonding and the controlled release of photochemically stored energy in the norbornadiene/quadricyclane photoswitch were explored. In the first part of this thesis, the encapsulation and subsequent release of hydrophobic molecules from water sources by shell by shell (SbS) coated nanocarriers was investigated. These nanocarriers were prepared through a two-step process. First, semiconducting TiO2 or ferromagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were covalently coated with a first ligand shell consisting of hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16) providing dispersibility in apolar solvents. This is followed by the addition of a second ligand shell that is an amphiphilic molecular building block like sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS). The addition of the amphiphilic building blocks is facilitated solely through hydrophobic interactions, rendering the resulting hybrid architectures dispersible in water. This enabled the uptake of several hydrophobic water contaminants like benzene, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or crude oil. The high efficiency of these nanocarriers was showcased by the high loading capacity (up to 400 %) and facile payload release through treatment with an organic solvent. In addition, the intrinsic magnetic properties of the utilized iron oxide nanoparticles ...",

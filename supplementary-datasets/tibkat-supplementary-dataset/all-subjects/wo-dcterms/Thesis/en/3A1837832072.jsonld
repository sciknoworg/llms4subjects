            "abstract": "Guided by an ecological model and expectancy-value theory, this cross-national comparative study aims to gain a clearer understanding of how psychological and contextual factors benefit or hinder children\u2019s science outcomes by comparing the phenomena in two contrasting country contexts. Particular attention is given to teachers\u2019 and parents\u2019 expectations, children\u2019s motivational beliefs about learning science, student gender and family circumstances that might magnify or reduce the gap in science achievement between Germany and Taiwan, specifically. Using TIMSS 2019 data and applying several HLM analyses, this quantitative study empirically and comparatively examines the ways in which both student and school attributes are related to science achievement. Results indicate that several affective and contextual characteristics, including students\u2019 attitudes toward science, family socio-economic status and parents\u2019 expectations, are related positively to student science achievement, both in Germany and Taiwan. No relationship, however, is found between teacher quality and science outcomes within each selected nation. Teachers\u2019 expectations and student gender are key predictors of science achievement only in Germany, and not in Taiwan. Further, teachers\u2019 and parents\u2019 expectations, respectively, impact the relationship between students\u2019 attitudes toward science and science achievement in Taiwan. Distinct social and cultural backgrounds across countries result in the differences observed in the ways that children are expected to be, and are, motivated between Germany and Taiwan, which may explain the gap in science outcomes between nations. Findings suggest that strengthening the connections among children, parents and teachers would help build a trusty, respectful and encouraging learning climate and environment benefiting the quality of science education and improve science achievement for each child regardless of their social origins and cultural background.",

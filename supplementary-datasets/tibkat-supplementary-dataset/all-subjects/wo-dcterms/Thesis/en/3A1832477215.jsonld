            "abstract": "Integrating renewable energys ources in sectors such as electricity, heat, and transportation must be structured in an economic, technological, and emission- efficient manner to address global environmental issues.Microgrids appear to be the solution for large-scale renewable energy integration in these sectors.The microgrid components must be optimally planned and operated to prevent high costs, technical issues, and emissions. Existing approaches for optimal microgrid planning and operation in the literature do not include a solution for e-mobility infrastructure. As a consequence, a compact e-mobility infrastructure metho- dology is provided.The development of e-mobility infrastructure has as sociated uncertainties (short and long-term). As a result, a new stochastic method re- ferred to as IGDM-DRO is proposed in this dissertation.The proposed method provides a risk-averse strategy for microgrid planning and operation by including long-term and short-term uncertainty related to e-mobility.The multi-cut ben- der decomposition is applied for IGDM-DRO to prevent the suggested method\u2019s intractability.Finally, the deterministic and stochastic methodologies are com bined in an ovelholistic approach for microgrid design and operation in terms of cost and robustness.The proposed method ist ested on a new settlement area in Magdeburg, Germany, under three different EV development scenarios (nega- tive, trend, andpositive).The share for the number of electric vehicles reached 31 percent of conventional vehicles by the end of the planned horizon. As a result, the microgrid\u2019s overall cost has been increased by 2.3 to 2.9 percent per electric vehicle.Three public electric vehicle charging stations will be required in the investigated settlement are a intrend 2031.The investigated settlement area will require a total cost of 127,029 \u20ac in the trend scenario.To achieve full robustness against long-term uncertainties,the cost of the microgrid needs to be increased by 80 percent.",

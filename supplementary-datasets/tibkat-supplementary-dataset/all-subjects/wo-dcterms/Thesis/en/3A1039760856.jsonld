            "title": "Structural rearrangements during copper cluster insertion into nitrous oxide reductase of Pseudomonas stutzeri",
            "abstract": "Abstract: Nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, is released to the environment via an incomplete denitrification process in bacteria that are able to use nitrate instead of oxygen as the final electron acceptor for energy conversion and due to an increased impact of humans in agriculture and industrial pollution. The last step of denitrification reduces nitrous oxide to dinitrogen via the copper-containing enzyme nitrous oxide reductase. This is the only known enzyme that could overcome the activation barrier of 250 kJ mol-1 for the exergonic process (\u0394G0\u00b4 = -339.5 kJ mol-1). In the functional head-to-tail dimer formation, the binuclear CuA site in one monomer and the unique [4Cu:2S] cluster in the CuZ site of the second monomer are 10 \u00c5 apart, whereby CuA serves as electron entry site and the CuZ cluster is the catalytic centre for substrate binding. Until today no other Cu-S cluster is found in biological systems, but in inorganic chemistry a small amount of comparable systems are already published that imitate the highly functional catalytic site. In literature, the enzyme is reported as oxygen-sensitive and the steps for biogenesis are not clarified. It is known that the nosZ gene that encodes for the enzyme is part of a gene cluster, containing biogenesis factors to assemble the functional enzyme or to provide electrons during the catalytic cycle. In this work, we have crystallized intermediate states of an incompletely assembled enzyme obtained from recombinant expression in Pseudomonas stutzeri. The results represent a series of structures with copper complements from zero to four in the CuZ cluster and additional, artificial occupancies with higher numbers. The surrounding protein environment, including a calcium and a potassium binding site, plays an important role during the incorporation, and the biogenesis of the two copper clusters acts in concert via internal rearrangements between the two sites. In addition, the structures of anoxically purified, but oxically crystallized enzyme for M. hydrocarbonoclasticus and P. stutzeri were solved and compared to anoxic structures. The results indicate MhN2OR as a less oxygen-sensitive enzyme than PsN2OR concerning the composition of the copper cluster. The second sulfur was published as the labile component during oxygen exposure. However, the crystal structures illustrate that not only the sulfur gets lost, but also additional copper ions are released in PsN2OR",

            "abstract": "Cold atoms, Bose-Einstein condensates, weightlessness, microgravity, Drop Tower Bremen. - Since the possibility of trapping and cooling neutral atoms, ultracold quantum gases have shifted boundaries in a growing field of modern physics based on the first observation of Bose-Einstein condensates in 1995 and appreciated by the Nobel Prizes in 1997 and 2001. The current developments in the domain of atom optics lead to an utilization of ultracold quantum matter techniques in unique practical applications as high-precision atomic clocks, atom interferometer technologies and inertial sensing instruments for gravity field mapping, underground structure detection, autonomous navigation, as well as precision measurements in fundamental physics. The expectations of even higher precision measurements can be performed by arbitrarily extending the time of unperturbed evolution of those quantum systems. In respect thereof weightlessness provides an outstanding basis for such applications and measurements. Motivated by these prospects, many national and international groups have initialized research programs aiming for compact, transportable and ruggedly designed atom-optical experiments, which might be launched in parabolic flights and space applications. Thanks to an easy access to low gravity on earth, realization of quantum degenerated gases in excellent microgravity conditions at the Drop Tower Bremen opened a new kind of perspectives on atom-optical experiments, e.g., to currently achieve longest expansion times of Bose-Einstein condensates within the QUANTUS pilot project (up to one second). Thus, ultracold quantum matter in an environment of weightlessness represents an emerging area of science in quantum engineering with an impressive potential for a future technology and multidisciplinary applications.",

            "abstract": "The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) is the peer review instrument adopted by the African Union as a mechanism to foster the adoption of policies to enhance the quality of governance among member States. Its review process relies on using self-reporting and monitoring tools to assess and encourage improvements in the policies of participating States. This dissertation explores the question of why, and under what conditions, member States acting within the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) decide to delegate decision competence to other bodies as part of the Review\u2019s decision-making process. It investigates how, and with what consequences, this delegation creates consequent mechanisms of functional differentiation which determines the patterns of decision-making in the APRM review process and the contents of country review reports. The dissertation engages modern institutional theory in order to explain the emergence of the governance system of the APR process. The APR Forum (the assembly of Heads of State participating in the APRM) has acted over time to create an increasingly complex governance structure and to delegate decision-making competencies to subsidiary bodies in order to arrive at decisions that require implementation by participating member States under the review process. With insight taken from modern institutional theory, this dissertation argues that the organizational structure of the APRM process is functionally differentiated, and that the decision-making system embedded within the review process therefore becomes divided between a rule-making function and the concomitant application of those rules to the specific historical circumstances of APR country processes. In this regard, therefore, the APR Forum concentrates its functions on formulating general rules, while the APR Panel and subsidiary committees subsequently apply these rules to individual case specific review processes. This dissertation contends that such functional differentiation in the APRM promotes deliberations, at both the rule making stage and the norm application phase of the decision process, which consequently affect the decision process in ways that favour merit-based decisions-making and inhibit raw power politics. Based on previously overlooked sources, the dissertation further conducts an empirical analysis of the effects of functional differentiation in the examples of three APR country processes (i.e. South Africa, Ghana and Kenya), using qualitative expert interviews and process-tracing. It concludes that functional differentiation in the decision process of the APRM provides a powerful mechanism to promote merit-based decisions, even at the country level where the process is led by the country under review.",

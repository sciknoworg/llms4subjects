                "Gout was described by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC as a disease of rich people and linked with excess food and alcohol. It is caused by long-lasting hyperuricemia, which is a result of an imbalance between excretion and production of uric acid. The surplus of uric acid leads to deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints, which can initiate a painful inflammation called a gout attack. Despite various pharmacological treatments for this disease, a low purine diet remains the basis of all gout therapies. Since food is rich in purines, the aim of this project was to develop a novel enzyme system to decrease the purine content of food, what should result in reduced serum urate concentration in patients with hyperuricemia. The system consists of five degrading enzymes (adenine deaminase, guanine deaminase, xanthine oxidoreductase, urate oxidase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase) that combined in one product are able to hydrolyse all purines to a highly soluble allantoin, which can be easily removed from the body. This approach provides the patients a possibility to reduce the symptoms and frequency of gout attacks or even doses of prescribed drugs. In order to obtain necessary system components, yeast Arxula adeninivorans LS3 was screened for enzyme activities. A. adeninivorans is known to utilise various purines and this ability is a result of activity of desired enzymes, two of which, adenine deaminase and xanthine oxidoreductase, are in focus of this thesis ..."

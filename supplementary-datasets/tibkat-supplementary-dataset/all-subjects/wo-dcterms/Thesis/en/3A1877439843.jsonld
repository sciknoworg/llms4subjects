            "title": "Development of a model co-culture platform with Trichoderma reesei RUT C-30 and Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) for natural producttargeted bioprocesses",
            "abstract": "A model natural product-targeted filamentous co-culture, based on the cellulolytic fungi Trichoderma reesei and the bacteria Streptomyces coelicolor is here presented. For this purpose, a fluorescence-based online monitoring method for these strains with the mCherry and mNeonGreen (mNG) tags, respectively was set. Robustness was confirmed with fluorescence-to-biomass correlations in axenic cultures and biasing effects of autofluorescence and pigment formation were addressed. This method was validated in co-culture using the substrate alpha-cellulose where the abundance of each strain accurately described the variations in the inoculum. Further understanding of the population dynamics was gained through online fluorescence of T. reesei and S. coelicolor coupled to respiratory oxygen transfer rate (OTR) monitoring. This allowed to identify conditions of cellulose degradability and pigment formation and also know how to modulate biotic and abiotic conditions such as inoculation ratio, osmolality and shaking frequency, to favor outcompetition of a strain if required. Finally, metabolomic analysis for a wide range of biomass ratios of this co-culture was done comparing spores and live mycelia as inoculation approaches. This portrayed the production of characteristic S. coelicolor secondary metabolites in similar population mixtures regardless of the inoculation method. Yet, higher induction levels of metabolite biosynthesis were observed in co-cultures employing live mycelia. This analysis, which was coupled to fluorescence ratios (growth ratios) suggest the possible cooperative biotransformation of dimerumic acid from T. reesei into the compound Eleutherazine B by S. coelicolor. This platform fills a gap between natural product screening and cellulose-based bioprocesses, due to feedback control of the microbial abundances required for biosynthesis of metabolites, expanding the potential for triggering of silent biosynthetic gene clusters and joint biotransformations.",

            "abstract": "The Compton camera is a new detector system for imaging radioactively labeled nuclides in the range of ?-rays that can in principle provide extremely good resolution and high sensitivity. This is invaluable for the modern bio-medicine research or diagnostic studies based on it. For this system a new concept of software based coincidence measurements has been developed; inspired by the data acquisition systems built for high energy physics, where the information from thousands of channels of various detectors has to be merged. A data acquisition system based on digitizing analog signals with FADCs (flash analog to digital converters) has been built consisting of a modern structure of first level processor unit realized with FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) and an extendable fast data bus. The developed data acquisition system is capable of collecting the signals from a 19-channel scatter detector and an absorption detector (Anger camera) unambiguously. Here the usage of time stamping plays a central role in order to attribute the asynchronous signals of detector components to synchronous event fragments for further processing. With this data acquisition system it is shown for the first time that the signals from the silicon drift detector that are generated through Compton electrons and signals of scattered gamma quants produced in the second absorption detector can be put in pairs to reconstruct scattering events where an angular resolution of approximately 1\u02bf is achieved. This precision is close to the theoretically expected value.",

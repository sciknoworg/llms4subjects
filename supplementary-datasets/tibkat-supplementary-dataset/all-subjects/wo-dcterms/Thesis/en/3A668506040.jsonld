            "title": "Selective transfer of exosomes from oligodendrocytes to microglia by macropinocytosis",
            "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes are the myelin forming cells of the central nervous system. These cells synthesize vast amounts of membrane during the active phase of myelination. In addition, membrane components are released into the extracellular space as small vesicles, exosomes, with a size of 50 to 100 nm. In this study we address the fate and function of oligodendroglial exosomes in the extracellular space. We, found that exosomes purifi.ed from oligodendroglial precursor cell line and primary oligodendrocyte cultures were efficiently and selectively internalized by microglia without inducing a pro-inflammatory response. The internalization occurred by macropinocytosis that was partially dependent on exosomal lipid phosphatidylserine and autonomous of typical phagocytic receptors. Interestingly, we identifi.ed two subpopulations of microglia after stimulation with in inflammatory cytokines. One subpopulation of microglia displayed antigen-presenting capacity due to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression, whereas the other microglial pool remained MHCII negative. However, exosome internalization occurred preferentially by microglia without antigen-presenting capacity. Based on these results, we propose that oligodendrocytes secrete exosomes into the extracellular space to employ microglia for the degradation of membrane components during myelination and membrane turnover. Moreover, the functional specialization of microglia supports the notion of heterogeneity in the microglial population. Yet, it remains to be elucidated whether the functional specialization of microglia is intrinsic or mediated by the microglial microenvironment.",

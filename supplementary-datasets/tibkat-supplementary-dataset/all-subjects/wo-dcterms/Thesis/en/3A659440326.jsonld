            "abstract": "Oncogene-induced senescence, mesenchymal stem cells, uterine leiomyomas, HMGA2. - Uterine leiomyomas (syn: fibroids ) are the most common tumors of the female genital tract. Up to 77 % of women of reproductive age have leiomyomas (Cramer and Patel, 1990). Regardless of their benign character, leiomyomas are responsible for severe clinical symptoms including infertility and pregnancy loss (Greenberg and Kazamel, 1995). As a consequence leiomyomas are the major cause for hysterectomy in the United States accounting for over 200,000 hysterectomies annually (Walker and Stewart, 2005). Despite their high prevalence there has been little innovation in therapies for leiomyomas over the past years and the treatment options besides surgical removal are still limited. Also, relatively little is known about the pathogenesis of fibroids and the causes of tumor-development are still unknown. The aim of the present thesis was to investigate the mechanisms contributing to the spontaneous growth arrest frequently observed in uterine leiomyomas. The results identify p14Arf and therefore the p53-dependent senescence as a major player in the growth control of fibroids. HMGA2 plays a major role in the development of benign mesenchymal tumors and is associated with self-renewal capacity of stem-cells. In order to understand the HMGA2-p14Arf relationship in the genesis of fibroids a series of experiments on mesenchymal stem cells, the proposed cells of origin of leiomyomas, was performed. Contrary to the expectation that HMGA2 represses p14Arf the results show an activation of p14Arf by HMGA2 that ensures genomic stability in case of oncogenic stress whereas in turn p14Arf can repress HMGA2 via the stabilization of p53 which in turn is able to upregulate several micro RNAs of the let-7 family. The results of the present thesis are in line with the idea that uterine fibroids develop from mesenchymal stem-cells resinding in the myometrium. Due to HMGA2-rearrangements a dormant stem-cell is ...",

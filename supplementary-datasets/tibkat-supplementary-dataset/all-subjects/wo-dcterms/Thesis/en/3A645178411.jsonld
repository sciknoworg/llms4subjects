            "abstract": "Paleoproductivity, NW Africa, benthic foraminifera, Heinrich stadials, stable isotopes, Mg/Ca paleothermometry, ITCZ. - This PhD thesis examines climate-induced changes in the atmospheric circulation off and over southern Northwest Africa and its effect on marine primary productivity and sea surface temperature conditions during the Late Pleistocene. For this purpose two sediment cores from the continental slope off Northwest Africa at 12\u02bfN (GeoB9526-5 and GeoB9527-5) are investigated for benthic foraminiferal assemblages, stable oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of benthic and planktic foraminiferal tests, Mg/Ca paleothermometry and sedimentary geochemical parameters. Additionally, Mg/Ca data obtained from sediment core GeoB95208-5 located at 15\u02bfN are included. The results of benthic foraminiferal assemblage (GeoB9526-5) and geochemical analyses (GeoB9526-5 and GeoB9527-5) reveal that high-latitude cold events as well as variations in low-latitude summer insolation had an impact on humidity, wind conditions and the location of the tropical rainbelt during the last 31 kyr, which in turn resulted in changes in the intensity and seasonality of primary productivity off southern Northwest Africa. High accumulation rates of benthic foraminifera, carbonate and organic carbon as well as the dominance of infaunal species and high numbers of deep infaunal species indicate high primary productivity and enhanced supply of refractory organic matter from the upper slope and shelf during melt water events (Heinrich stadial 1 and 2). A more southern tropical rainbelt as well as intensified Northeast trade winds are suggested to have provoked almost permanent upwelling. A phytodetritus-related benthic fauna indicates seasonally pulsed input of labile organic matter and low year-round primary productivity during the Last Glacial Maximum. Compared to Heinrich stadials, a more northward expanded rainbelt and lower Northeast trade wind intensity resulted in seasonal and weak upwelling. High productivity with seasonally high input of labile organic matter is supposed for the orbitally forced African Humid Period. An intensified African monsoon and the ...",

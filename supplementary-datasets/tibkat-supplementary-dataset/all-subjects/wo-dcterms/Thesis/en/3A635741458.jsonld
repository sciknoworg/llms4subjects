            "abstract": "Swift heavy ion irradiation causes several effects on the target material. This doctoral thesis is about two effects, namely track formation and ion beam induced annealing. Tetrahedral amorphous carbon, a material consisting of 80% sp3 bound carbon, is known to form sp2 rich filaments after swift heavy ion irradiation along the ions path (i.e. 1 GeV U-ions). This phase transformation causes a change in conductivity, the ion tracks with a diameter of 8 nm form conductive nanowires embedded in an insulating matrix. The aim of this thesis was increasing the conductivity of the tracks and retaining the insulating properties of the surrounding matrix. Two approaches were made to achieve this. First, the ta-C samples were doped with nitrogen, boron, iron or copper during deposition. The concentration was kept below 2 at% to avoid sp2 bond formation. It is expected that these dopants enhance conductivity by increasing the amount of localized states at the Fermi level. Second, as irradiation with a higher electronic energy loss forms more conductive tracks, the electronic energy loss during irradiation was increased ...",

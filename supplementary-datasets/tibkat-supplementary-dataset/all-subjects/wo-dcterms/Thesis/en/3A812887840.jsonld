            "title": "Functional analysis of MYB112 transcription factor in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana",
            "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are ubiquitous gene expression regulators and play essential roles in almost all biological processes. This Ph.D. project is primarily focused on the functional characterisation of MYB112 - a member of the R2R3-MYB TF family from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This gene was selected due to its increased expression during senescence based on previous qRT-PCR expression profiling experiments of 1880 TFs in Arabidopsis leaves at three developmental stages (15 mm leaf, 30 mm leaf and 20% yellowing leaf). MYB112 promoter GUS fusion lines were generated to further investigate the expression pattern of MYB112. Employing transgenic approaches in combination with metabolomics and transcriptomics we demonstrate that MYB112 exerts a major role in regulation of plant flavonoid metabolism. We report enhanced and impaired anthocyanin accumulation in MYB112 overexpressors and MYB112-deficient mutants, respectively. Expression profiling reveals that MYB112 acts as a positive regulator of the transcription factor PAP1 leading to increased anthocyanin biosynthesis, and as a negative regulator of MYB12 and MYB111, which both control flavonol biosynthesis. We also identify MYB112 early responsive genes using a combination of several approaches. These include gene expression profiling (Affymetrix ATH1 micro-arrays and qRT-PCR) and transactivation assays in leaf mesophyll cell protoplasts. We show that MYB112 binds to an 8-bp DNA fragment containing the core sequence (A/T/G)(A/C)CC(A/T)(A/G/T)(A/C)(T/C). By electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) we demonstrate that MYB112 binds in vitro and in vivo to MYB7 and MYB32 promoters revealing them as direct downstream target genes. MYB TFs were previously reported to play an important role in controlling flavonoid biosynthesis in plants. Many factors acting upstream of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway show enhanced expression levels during nitrogen limitation, or elevated sucrose content. In addition to the mentioned conditions, other environmental parameters including salinity or high light stress may trigger anthocyanin accumulation. In contrast to several other MYB TFs affecting anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway genes, MYB112 expression is not controlled by nitrogen limitation, or carbon excess, but rather is stimulated by salinity and high light stress. Thus, MYB112 constitutes a previously uncharacterised regulatory factor that modifies anthocyanin accumulation under conditions of abiotic stress.",

            "abstract": "Mass movement deposits and small-scale deformation structures mapped in seismic data and recovered in sediment cores from four lakes in Central Switzerland can be related to large historic and prehistoric earthquakes during the last 15000 years. The Swiss historic earthquake catalogue covering approximately the last 1000 years shows an enhanced seismicity in Central Switzerland at the northern Alpine front including three major earthquakes with magnitudes of Mw=5.7 to Mw=6.2, which are the 1964AD Alpnach, 1774AD Altdorf and 1601AD Unterwalden earthquakes. Furthermore, the northern part of Central Switzerland was influenced by the catastrophic 1356AD Basel earthquake with a magnitude of Mw=6.9. Four lakes in Central Switzerland (Baldegger See, Seelisberg Seeli, Sarner See and Lungerer See) distributed within an area of approximately 2000km2 were studied with respect to their response on groundshaking using high-resolution seismic data and sediment cores. The sediments consist mainly of finely layered carbonate- and organic-rich mud. They are dated by correlation of historic data and radiocarbon ages and reach maximum ages of 15000 cal y BP...",

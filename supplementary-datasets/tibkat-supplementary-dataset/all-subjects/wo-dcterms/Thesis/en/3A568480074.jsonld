            "abstract": "Managed forests act as sinks or sources of atmospheric carbon by temporarily sequestering carbon in standing biomass, dead wood, organic layer, mineral soil, and wood products. Accounting of this carbon sink and managing forests with the aim of increasing the carbon sink need projections of the development of the sink with different management options. This thesis developed a methodology to simulate the carbon sink of individual managed forest stands using standard forestry data sources as they are available for many forested regions in Europe. As a test case area the German federal state Thuringia was taken in accordance with several other forest carbon projects. The presented methodology extends an empirical multi-species stand growth model with carbon quantification and couples this model to the Yasso soil carbon model, which was extended to handle multiple species and cohorts. The coupled model also includes newly developed component models of forest management, and of carbon in wood products.",

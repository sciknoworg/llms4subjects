            "abstract": "0/1-Polytopes appear in many areas of discrete mathematics. The most prominent among them might be polyhedral combinatorics. Although polyhedral combinatorics is often connected with combinatorial optimization there are also important connection to other areas of discrete mathematics such as counting combinatorial objects. Despite their vast area of applications, there is no comprehensive theory of 0/1-polytopes. It seems that 9/1-polytopes are particularly complex objects. The results of this thesis can be divided into three main categories: (1) upper bounds on the minimal number of faces (edges and facets), (2) a conjecture of Mihail and Vazirani, and (3) random 0/1-polytopes. There two ways to view random 0/1-polytopes. randomness can be used to break the complex structure of 0/1-polytopes. On the other hand properties of random 0/1-polytopes can be seen as typical properties of (deterministic) 0/1-polytopes. Typical properties can play an important role to judge results on specific 0/1-polytopes ...",

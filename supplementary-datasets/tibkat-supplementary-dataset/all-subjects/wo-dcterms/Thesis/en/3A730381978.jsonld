            "abstract": "Biological diversity exist between species and within species among populations and individuals. Intraspecies diversity has been extensively studied at the genome level but intraspecies diversity in metabolic constitution has received very limited attention was studied only in a handful of publications. To our knowledge no studies have been published on phytohormones in sesame. Apart from the academic interest in metabolic diversity, stress hormone play an important role in defense against pathogens. Phytohormones level are also relevant from practical point of view because seeds of sesame sometimes germinate spontaneously while capsules still attach to the plants and green. This is highly undesirable characteristic because valueable seeds are lost. We determined the diversity in phytohormone level among 16 sesame accessions of different geographical origin. We able to detect ABA, JA, SA and SAG in leaves and roots while GA4 only in leaves. One of the accession orignating from Japan (\"Japan 2\") produced high level of JA, SA as well as SAG. This accession was producing high amount of chitinase as well, which is essential for the degradation of chitin, a major component of the fungal cell wall. Characterization of accessions by AFLP reveled that \"Japan 2\" was not genetically more distant from the other accessions than the average distance within the collection ...",

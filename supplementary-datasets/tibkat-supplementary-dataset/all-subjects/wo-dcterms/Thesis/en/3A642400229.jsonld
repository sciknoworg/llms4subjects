            "abstract": "The introduction of alien species into new environments for many centuries has led to global biodiversity impacts which have been altering ecological processes gradually. These alterations include the extinction of species and even the endangering of valuable ecosystems as well as an irrational increase in the economics and cost controls. One of the reasons for species introduction is the growing need for using them as timber, medicinal plants or food. Other species have been introduced for purely scientific purposes so escaping cultivation and becoming real problems in the ecosystems where they are included. This is the case of Ailanthus altissima (Mill), swingle (ailanto or tree of heaven\u02ba), Quassia family (Simaroubaceae). More than 200 years ago, Alianthus was introduced in Europe where it has been causing serious damage due to the size and strength of its roots which are able to break up walls, foundations, water pipes, sewage systems, roads and rails. Thanks to its strong competitive ability and to its production of alellopathic substances, this plant limited and displaced native species. Apart from that, its pollen and chemicals are capable of producing allergies and, in some instances, poisoning deaths ...",

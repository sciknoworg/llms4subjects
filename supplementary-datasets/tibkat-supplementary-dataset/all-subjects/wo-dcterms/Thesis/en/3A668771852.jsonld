                "In the rf-plasma of the linear magnetized VINETA experiment, different types of low-frequency waves are observed. The emphasis in this work is on the interaction mechanism between drift waves on the one and kinetic Alfven waves on the other hand. In the peaked density profile of the plasma column drift waves occur as modulation of the plasma density. As gradient driven instability, they draw their energy from the radial density gradients. Alfven waves as magnetic field fluctuations are stable in the present configuration. They are launched by a magnetic excitation antenna. Parallel conduction currents in the plasma are common to both wave phenoma. A B-dot probe as standard diagnostic tool is used to detect the fluctuating magnetic fields of both wave types. The challenge are the small induced voltages due to the low wave frequency. The probe design with an integrated amplifier close to the probe head takes this into acount. The developed B-dot probe is mounted to different positioning systems to characterize both wave phenomena. For Alfven waves, the dispersion relation is recorded experimentally. It is found to be in good agreement with the prediction of the Hall-MHD theory with included resistive term, accounting for the cold collisional plasma. The fluctuating magnetic field pattern is recorded with azimuthal scans. The current density is obained by Amperes law. It is concentrated in helically twisted current filaments ..."

            "abstract": "This study aimed at improving the prediction of intramuscular fat (IMF) in porcine musculus longissimus via spectral analysis of the backscattered ultrasound signal on intact hot carcasses. The intramuscular fat content is considered to be one of the most important parameters influencing meat quality and its prediction was therefore the aim of multiple investigations. First attempts performed at porcine muscle via spectral analysis of unprocessed backscatter data showed promising results (prediction error (RMSEP): 0.36 %) but were not satisfying for industrial use at slaughter (M\u00f6rlein et al., 2005). One of the drawbacks of ultrasound systems is the influence of biological tissue on form and structure of the sound field which has to be corrected for quantitative analyses. Therefore, in a first step precise reference values have been collected for backfat and muscle on 27 pig carcasses representative for German slaughter facilities. Muscle and backfat samples were obtained at the position of the 2nd / 3rd last rib. Structural (e.g. fibre diameter) and compositional (e.g. fat, dry matter) traits were analysed in these samples under laboratory conditions. Acoustic measurements were performed using a scanning acoustic microscope with a 10-MHz centre frequency. Native muscle samples were analysed 24 hrs p.m.. In addition, formalin-fixed, frozen-thawed and aged (48 hrs p.m.) muscle samples were analysed to enable a comparison with literature data and to evaluate the influence of processing on the ultrasound parameters. The complete backfat (including skin), all 3 fat layers separately and the skin alone have been analysed. Constant environmental conditions (e.g. temperature) and exact thickness determination enabled accurate sound velocity and attenuation measurements ...",

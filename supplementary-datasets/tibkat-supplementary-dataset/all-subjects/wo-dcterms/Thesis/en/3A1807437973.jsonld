            "abstract": "The aim of this thesis was to investigate lithium intercalation in the single van der Waals gallery of a bilayer of two-dimensional materials driven by electrochemistry. Lithium intercalation is the process of lithium ions being incorporated between the layers of a layered host material. Since these ions carry a charge, energy can be stored this way. The most known application are batteries, where upon charging, lithium is removed from the cathode, a lithium compound, and incorporated at the anode. The commercially most frequently used material for this purpose is a compound consisting primarily of graphite, the layered allotrope of carbon. The elemental building block of graphite is graphene, the two-dimensional, one atom thick allotrope of carbon. It was first isolated in experiments in 2004 by A. Geim and K. Novoselov. They were awarded the Nobel prize in 2010 for their findings. Graphene opened up a wide variety of research due to the ease of production. When thinning down graphite, which is a random process, bilayer graphene can also be isolated. It provides the thinnest possible material suitable for lithium intercalation by offering only one interlayer gap. Thus, it can be considered the most basic building unit of a battery anode. In previous studies, this material has been successfully intercalated with lithium ions using on-chip electrochemistry. By doing so, charged ions in the electrolyte are separated and they accumulate at the interfaces. In the case of a lithium containing electrolyte, lithium ions can additionally intercalate into the material when a voltage above a certain threshold is applied, which leads to doping of the host material. This method is applied in this thesis as well in order to further investigate the process of lithium intercalation into bilayer graphene. The investigation tool of choice here was the SALVE TEM, which enables in-situ recording on the atomic scale due to its outstanding resolution. To perform these TEM studies, modifications of the sample layout became necessary, ...",

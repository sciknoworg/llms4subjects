            "title": "Molecular mechanism of B cell antigen receptor-induced SHIP activation",
            "abstract": "Regulation of B cell activation is highly important to keep the balance between immunity and self-tolerance. The SH2 domain-containing 5&rsquo; inositol phosphatase (SHIP) is an inhibitor of B cell activation as it hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate. It thereby depletes membrane anchors required for plasma membrane recruitment of effectors of B cell activation, more precisely of components of the Ca2+ initiation complex. This results in inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization. SHIP was discovered as an inhibitor activated by immune complexes, which are found at the end of immune responses. Immune complexes coactivate the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and the low-affinity receptor for IgG, Fc?RIIB, which directly binds to SHIP. Later studies demonstrated Fc?RIIB-independent SHIP functions as well. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this BCR-autonomous activation was unknown. Here, SHIP activation in the absence of the Fc?RIIB was clearly demonstrated in DT40 cells. Live cell imaging of EGFP-labeled SHIP variants was done to analyze SHIP plasma membrane recruitment, which is considered to be the most essential step in its activation, providing it with access to its substrate. This showed that the process of SHIP activation has several structural requirements. Most pivotal is its SH2 domain. Mass spectrometry analysis in combination with biochemical analyses demonstrated binding of this domain to the signaling subunits of the BCR, Iga and Ig\u00df. It will be interesting to identify the exact binding site, offering insights into how SHIP competes with Syk for binding to Iga and Ig\u00df. In line with this, a more detailed study of membrane localization was performed using total internal reflection microscopy ...",

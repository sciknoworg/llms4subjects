Atmospheric CO2 is fixed into biomass by photosynthesis of terrestrial and marine primary producers. Until final burial in marine sediments, the biologically fixed carbon that escapes remineralisation undergoes exchange between various active carbon reservoirs. Until now, the timescales on which terrestrial and marine organic matter is exchanged between the terrigenous, oceanic, and sedimentary carbon pool as well as the residence time in the respective reservoirs are still poorly understood. Compound-specific radiocarbon analysis of biomarkers provides a powerful tool to determine the temporal scales of such exchange processes. In this thesis, the timescales of different physicochemical and sedimentological processes are resolved including timescales of lateral sediment transport within the ocean, terrestrial residence times of terrigenous organic matter prior to delivery to the ocean, and timescales of organic matter preservation in the ocean.",

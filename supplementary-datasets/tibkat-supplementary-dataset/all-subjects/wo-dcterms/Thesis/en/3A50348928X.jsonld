            "abstract": "In the literature there is a longstanding discussion as to whether positive and negative feelings vary oppositionally or independently as well as whether a bipolar or unipolar model of the structure of affect fits better. Empirical evidence exists for both positions. Recent theoretical developments attempt to integrate the competing models. Such integrative approaches no longer address the question of whether the structure of affect is bipolar or unipolar, but rather under what conditions positive and negative affect tend to a bipolar or to a unipolar structure, respectively. It is assumed that the structure of affect converges to a bipolar continuum dependent on the affect scales used and / or the characteristics of the emotions measured. Specifically, it is assumed that under the condition that semantically correlated (vs. uncorrelated) scales are used and / or global, conscious or intense affects are captured, a bipolar structure of emotions can be found. These assumptions provide a partial explanation of the contradictory empirical findings. However, there are still questions to be answered. In this work, an alternative integrative approach is proposed. This approach relates the structure of affect to the origins of emotions and attributes the affect structure to the characteristics of the affect causes. It claims that the structure of affect depends on whether a situation or environment speaks to both positive and negative affects or only one affect. Specifically, it is expected that the number and dimensionality of affect causes should increase the probability that both affect types are changed and a compensatory variation is observed (bipolarity). While a single affect cause dimension only affects one of the two affect qualities and, accordingly, produces a non-compensatory variation of affect (unipolarity), the literature suggests that the key causes of affect are personal value and personal controllability of the stimulus. It is assumed that the value of a stimulus is a two-dimensional affect cause that varies on the dimensions of positivity and negativity. Personal controllability, on the other hand, only ranges between the endpoints \"no control\" and \"total control\" and is thus characterized by only one dimension. If the proposed approach is correct, a change in both affect causes or at least in the stimulus valence (multi dimensions) should provoke a variation in both affects (hypothesis 1). A mere change of the personal stimulus controllability (one dimension) should lead exclusively to a change in one of the two affects, while the other remains unaffected (hypothesis 2). In order to test this approach, eight experiments were conducted. The subjects were to work on several computerized contingency learning tasks in which they caused a light to flash on the screen by pressing or not pressing a key. As independent variables, the monetary value of light onset and light offset (stimulus valence: gain vs. loss vs. neutral), and / or the contingency and frequency of light onset (stimulus controllability: low vs. high vs. not manipulated) were varied. As dependent variables, positive affect and negative affect were assessed on separate scales using the PANAS. Experiment 1 demonstrated that positive and negative affect vary as a function of stimulus valence and personal stimulus controllability. Furthermore, this experiment showed that the affects vary compensatory as well as non-compensatory. In Experiment 2 and 3, the effect of the factor stimulus valence was examined and a compensatory variation (bipolar structure) of the affects was found. Experiments 4 through 7 served to investigate the effect of personal stimulus controllability and consistently showed a non-compensatory, independent variation of affects (unipolar structure). Finally, experiment 8 demonstrated the effects, that is the compensatory and the non-compensatory variation of the affects, within the same individuals and showed that the structure of emotions does vary and that this variation can be traced back to the number and dimensionality of the present affect causes. This approach opens a theoretical framework for future studies on the structure of affect and offers an experimental paradigm by which affects can be induced in the lab (contingency learning paradigm).",

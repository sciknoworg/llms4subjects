            "abstract": "Sustainable management of trans-boundary groundwater aquifers is usually difficult due to the complexity of natural and man-made systems. Therefore, sustainable management of trans-boundary water resources is urgently needed. The Western Aquifer Basin (WAB), in the West Bank and Israel, was depicted as a case study. The aquifer inflow is dominated by the rainfall over the replenishment areas with an estimated annual average 373 Million m3/yr during the period 1951-2006. The analysis of the recharge-rainfall relation confirmed that the annual recharge volumes are directly correlated to the monthly rainfall, where the highest recharge to rainfall ratio occurred whenever the majority of the annual rainfall comes during November, December, January and February. Accordingly, an empirical equation was developed which relates the annual recharge with monthly amounts of rainfall over the replenishment areas of the aquifer ...",

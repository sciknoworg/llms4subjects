            "abstract": "Fast synaptic transmission is mediated by the triggered release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles (SVs). To regulate synaptic transmission and neuronal activity, neurons also release neuropeptides and hormones from dense-core vesicles (DCVs). While SVs can be recycled, DCVs have to be newly synthesized in the cell body after release. DCVs are believed to be generated at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) as immature DCVs, which subsequently undergo a maturation process through clathrin-mediated membrane remodeling events. This maturation process is required for efficient processing of neuropeptides within DCVs and removal of factors that would otherwise interfere with DCV release. It has been shown that only mature DCVs are able to undergo stimulus-dependent exocytosis. Previously, we showed that the small Rab GTPase, RAB-2, and its effector, RIC-19/ICA69, are involved in neuronal DCV maturation in Caenorhabditis elegans. In rab-2 mutants, specific cargo is lost from maturing DCVs and mis-sorted into the endosomal-lysosomal degradation route. This cargo loss could be prevented by blocking endosomal delivery. This suggested that RAB-2 is involved in retention of DCV components during the sorting process at the Golgi-endosomal interface. To understand how RAB-2 activity is regulated at the Golgi, we screened for RAB-2 specific GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). We identified a potential RAB-2 GAP, TBC-8, which is exclusively expressed in neurons, and when depleted, shows similar DCV maturation defects as rab-2 mutants. We could demonstrate that RAB-2 binds to its putative GAP, TBC-8. Furthermore, we found novel factors involved in DCV maturation, RUND-1 and CCCP-1. Interestingly, both RAB-2 effectors, RUND-1 and RIC-19, interacted with the negative regulator of RAB-2, the GAP TBC-8, in binding studies ...",

            "abstract": "This work was written as a cumulative doctoral thesis based on reviewed publications. Climate projections are mainly based on the results of numeric simulations from global or regional climate models. Up to now processes between atmosphere and land surface are only rudimentarily known. This causes one of the major uncertainties in existing models. In order to reduce parameterisation uncertainties and to find a reasonable description of sub grid heterogeneities, the determination and evaluation of parameterisation schemes for modelling require as many datasets from different spatial scales as possible. This work contributes to this topic by implying different datasets from different platforms. Its objective was to analyse the spatial heterogeneity of land surface parameters and energy flux densities obtained from both satellite observations with different spatial and temporal resolutions and in-situ measurements. The investigations were carried out for two target areas in Germany...",

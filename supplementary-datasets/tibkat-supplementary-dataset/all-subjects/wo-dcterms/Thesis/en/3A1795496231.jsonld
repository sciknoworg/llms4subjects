            "abstract": "Research and development on IT security yields many different techniques and concepts to thwart off attackers in computer systems and networks, all of which come with different advantages and disadvantages. Choosing a capable solution that fits one's needs is a crucial, but also very challenging task. This is especially true for new emerging security paradigms where empirical data from the real world are still missing. One of these IT security paradigms is Moving Target Defense (MTD). Through repeatedly altering a system's configuration and/or appearance, MTD intends to divert attackers, inhibit reconnaissance and increase effort of attacks. Many publications have emerged from research in this field, suggesting new techniques or providing practical implementations. However, it is not ultimately clear how effective these Moving Target Defense techniques actually are, and how they compare to each other or conventional defense mechanisms. Previous research mainly focused on the evaluation of individual techniques or on the comparison of at most two or three of them in very limited theoretical scenarios. What has been lacking so far is a flexible framework for assessing and fairly comparing the effectiveness of different defense techniques in diverse, and most importantly, realistic scenarios. This would assist researchers in benchmarking proposed techniques, and practitioners in selecting appropriate defenses that fit their scenarios. To solve this problem, defense techniques and the attacks they are supposed to protect against need to be assessed under realistic conditions to be able to deliver meaningful results in the first place. Furthermore, such evaluation must not be limited to defenses arising from MTD or any other emerging paradigm for that matter, but be applicable to traditional and established defenses alike, to allow for a fair comparison. To this end, an attack simulation-based evaluation framework is proposed that --- based on detailed modeling --- is able to compare different types of defenses under ...",

            "abstract": "The identification of new functional moieties and chemical reactions that are inspired by small molecules is crucial in modern nanotechnological research. Their incorporation into either polymer backbones or side group structures opens up new and innovative pathways for the development of dynamic and responsive polymer architectures. In this regard, sulfoxide-containing polymers are materials that are governed by the outstanding physicochemical properties of the sulfoxide moiety. Its high hydrophilicity translates into polymers with very low cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility. Thus, making them interesting candidates for biomedical applications. However, this pure hydrophilicity also limits the potential of this interesting polymer class. Overcoming this limitation, to gain access to new adaptive and tailor-made sulfoxide-containing polymers with additional areas of applications, remains a challenge. In this work, this challenge was approached in two ways. First, new dynamic and responsive properties of polysulfoxides were introduced via a rational molecular design. Here, by controlling the amphiphilic balance of alkyl sulfoxide groups a temperature-responsive polymer profile was realized. Furthermore, an additional stimuli response was achieved by utilizing the oxidation of the polar sulfoxides to the respective hydrophobic sulfones. As a result, the polymer properties could be extended from its pure hydrophilic nature to a multistimuli- responsive behavior. Second, new interactions at the biointerface were assessed though the incorporation of sulfoxide moieties in colloidal systems. By decorating biocompatible nanogels with the outstanding skin interaction properties of sulfoxide groups, a promising new approach was developed to expand the toolbox of dermal delivery vehicles. Here, dimethyl sulfoxide-inspired nanogels showed the strong potential to increase dermal drug delivery while circumventing the skin disrupting disadvantages of the small molecule. Overall, this thesis exemplifies the strong ...",

                "The extraction of raw materials in mining, as for example copper, generally requires a separation of the natural resources quarried. In most cases complex ores, mixtures of different minerals and gangue have to be separated in order to enable an economic processing. In particular for the extraction of sulfides, oxides, carbonates, phosphates, but also of coal, froth flotation is mainly used for this purpose, therefore it is considered as the most important separation process in raw material industries. Several billion tons of ores are processed annually. The principle of flotation is based on the surface properties of the mixtures components and the separation efficiency, which decisively determines the required amount of water and various chemicals, if nothing else, is an important criterion in mineral exploration and it also significantly influences the environmental impact of mineral processing. The aim of, this work was to investigate the influence, of, low-temperature plasmas on the mineral surface and, based on the acquired knowledge, to develop and verify strategies that would increase the efficiency of flotation processes through plasma pre-treatment of mineral mixtures. Since these studies are unprecedented, the results presented can be classified as a contribution to application-oriented basic research. Powder of the sulfide minerals, pyrite (FeS2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcocite (Cu2S) and molybdenum sulfide (MoS2), were treated with plasmas of a radiofrequency ...",

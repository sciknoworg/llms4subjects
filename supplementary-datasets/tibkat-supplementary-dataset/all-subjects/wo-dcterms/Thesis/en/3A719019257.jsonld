            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: With the increasing development of renewable energies, the demand for energy wood will also further increase in the future. As resources are limited from the local forests new opportunities for the energy wood production are considered. One of these is the cultivation of fast growing tree species in short rotations. These so-called short rotation coppices (SRC) are mainly grown on agricultural land in rotations of usually 3-5 years. But an assessment how much arable land in Germany is suitable for the cultivation of short rotation plantations and how much biomass could be nationwide produced by SRC wasn\u2019t yet conducted. As part of this work it was therefore estimated how big the land- and biomass-potential of poplar and willow short rotation plantations on arable and permanent grassland in Germany is. On the basis of more detailed soil maps the SRC-potential for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg as well as for four municipalities in Baden-Wuerttemberg was also assessed. For this purpose in the first step, a yield model was created, which allows to estimate the achievable dry matter yield per hectare and year on the basis of the water availability. The model is based on the collection of the site condition and growth data from 62 three-year old SRC\u00b4s in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rheinland-Pfalz and France",

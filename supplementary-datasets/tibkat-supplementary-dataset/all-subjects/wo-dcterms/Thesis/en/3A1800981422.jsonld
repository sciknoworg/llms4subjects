            "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder, currently affecting 550,000 people in the German adult population. RA is defined by a chronic synovitis in diarthrodial joints, and occurs in phases of exacerbation and remission. Despite its characteristic polyarthritis, caused by synovial hyperplasia and inflammation, RA poses a systemic disorder, which affects multiple organs. Therefore, commonly associated comorbidities include osteopenia and osteoporosis, apart from spatially restricted bone erosions. The ubiquitous Janus kinase\u2013signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) machinery mediates signaling of multiple inflammatory cytokines, many of which are involved in the pathogenesis of RA. Hence, JAK inhibitors have emerged as a therapeutic approach for RA. The JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib were currently approved for the treatment of RA in the EU and USA and differ in their selectivity towards distinct JAK family members: Tofacitinib is a JAK3/JAK1 inhibitor, and baricitinib inhibits JAK1/JAK2. JAK inhibitors are well described regarding their anti-inflammatory properties, while their impact on bone metabolism has not been systematically studied. Since available RA therapies fail to reinstate homeostatic joint morphology, there is still pressing medical demand for adequate treatments. In this study, the osteometabolic properties of the JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib were analyzed. First, JAK inhibition was investigated in different in vivo mouse models: (1) Unchallenged steady-state conditions, (2) non-inflammatory bone loss in a model of postmenopausal osteoporosis and (3) inflammatory bone loss caused by serum-induced arthritis. In these mouse models, JAK inhibitors improved bone morphology and consistently elevated trabecular bone density, predominantly by increasing trabecular thickness. Those improvements in bone phenotype were accompanied by reductions in receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) blood serum levels and, accordingly, ...",

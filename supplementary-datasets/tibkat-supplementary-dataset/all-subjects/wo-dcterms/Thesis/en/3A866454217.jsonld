            "title": "The roles of secondary metabolites in microcystis inter-strain interactions",
            "abstract": "Among the bloom-forming and potentially harmful cyanobacteria, the genus Microcystis represents a most diverse taxon, on the genomic as well as on morphological and secondary metabolite levels. Microcystis communities are composed of a variety of diversified strains. The focus of this study lies on potential interactions between Microcystis representatives and the roles of secondary metabolites in these interaction processes. The role of secondary metabolites functioning as signaling molecules in the investigated interactions is demonstrated exemplary for the prevalent hepatotoxin microcystin. The extracellular and intracellular roles of microcystin are tested in microarray-based transcriptomic approaches. While an extracellular effect of microcystin on Microcystis transcription is confirmed and connected to a specific gene cluster of another secondary metabolite in this study, the intracellularly occurring microcystin is related with several pathways of the primary metabolism. A clear correlation of a microcystin knockout and the SigE-mediated regulation of carbon metabolism is found. According to the acquired transcriptional data, a model is proposed that postulates the regulating effect of microcystin on transcriptional regulators such as the alternative sigma factor SigE, which in return captures an essential role in sugar catabolism and redox-state regulation. For the purpose of simulating community conditions as found in the field, Microcystis colonies are isolated from the eutrophic lakes near Potsdam, Germany and established as stably growing under laboratory conditions. In co-habitation simulations, the recently isolated field strain FS2 is shown to specifically induce nearly immediate aggregation reactions in the axenic lab strain Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806. In transcriptional studies via microarrays, the induced expression program in PCC 7806 after aggregation induction is shown to involve the reorganization of cell envelope structures, a highly altered nutrient uptake balance and the reorientation of the aggregating cells to a heterotrophic carbon utilization, e.g. via glycolysis. These transcriptional changes are discussed as mechanisms of niche adaptation and acclimation in order to prevent competition for resources.",

                "Soon after their discovery in the 1960s, tetracyclines (Tcs) were found to own also non-antibiotic properties apart from their antibiotic effects. In this thesis the structural basics of both the antibiotic as well as the non-antibiotic effects are investigated and compared. The X-ray crystal structure analysis facilitates a detailed description of the specific interactions between tetracycline and the different proteins. Phospholipase A2 Specific interactions of tetracyclines with different proteins are the reason for their non-antibiotic effects. Tetracyclines have various pharmacological properties, which influence many different functions in the organism. It is known that some tetracyclines can inhibit for example phospholipases A2 (PLA2), neutral matrix metalloproteases or -amylases. For many years, tetracyclines are known to act like anti-inflammatory agents. PLA2 catalyzes the first reaction, which leads to the formation of eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are signal messengers similar to hormons, which act as neurotransmitters and participate in inflammatory processes in the body. An increased production of eicosanoids was observed in inflammatory deseases like rheuma or arthritis. Clinical tests revealed that the tetracycline derivative minocycline is able to inhibit the secretory phospholipase A2. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis benefited from first application tests with tetracyclines. The structural basis of the inhibition of PLA2 by minocycline was unknown up to now. The first part of the thesis describes the structural basis of the non-antibiotic interaction between the secretory phospholipase A2 and minocycline. This is the first X-ray crystal structure which shows a non-antibiotic interaction of a tetracycline and clarifies its structural background...",

            "title": "Some asymptotic properties of stochastic flows",
            "abstract": "The present work treats several asymptotic properties of stochastic flows on the Euclidean space, whose distributions are frequently assumed to be invariant under rotations of the state space. These stochastic flows include the isotropic Brownian flows, which have been studied since Yaglom (1957) or Baxendale, Harris and Le Jan (1980s). Furthermore isotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Flows are treated, which are considered since Dimitroff (2006) as well as repulsive isotropic flows, which are about to be introduced in this work. All these classes of stochastic flows are linked by a single stochastic differential equation which passes to one of the named cases by the specification of one real parameter. First we define the classes of models and cite important facts from the literature. Afterwards the spatial asymptotic behaviour of isotropic stochastic flows is treated in a short warm up chapter. A lemma is proved that serves to show that the unit ball based random dynamical system coming from an isotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flow is not sufficiently smooth to apply well known results concerning Pesin's formula from Ledrappier and Young (1980s) and hence to motivate the self contained study of this subject ...",

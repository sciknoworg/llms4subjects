Human intoxications usually occur via the ingestion of filter-feeding bivalves, but intoxications after consumption of predatory crabs have also been reported. The same group of toxins is produced by certain freshwater cyanobacteria, in which the gene cluster coding for the PSP toxin-producing enzymes has recently been identified. However, the identification of corresponding genes in dinoflagellates is pending, which might be due to their unusual and little understood genomes. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to understanding gene expression and regulation in dinoflagellates by investigating the transcriptome-level gene expression in A. minutum. The gene expression experiments were based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) library, which was generated from pooled samples originating from different treatments to include the highest possible diversity of cDNA sequences. A set of microarray probes based on this library was used for different gene expression experiments, such as the comparison of toxic and non-toxic strains. Three stains were compared at two different times of the light phase, yielding a group of 192 genes differentially expressed between toxic and non-toxic strains at both timepoints. Another experiment was based on the induction of a fivefold increase in toxin levels by the presence of a copepod grazer. In combination with the data obtained from the strain comparison experiment, this resulted in the identification of two sequences ...",

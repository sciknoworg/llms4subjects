            "abstract": "Long-period Variables (LPVs) and Miras are radially pulsating, highly evolved stars on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Due to peculiar conditions of this objects, their cool, extended atmospheres are distinguished sites for the formation of complex molecules and dust particles. The interplay between dust formation and stellar radiation results in a circumstellar dust shell (CDS) generating slow mass loss, which finally enriches the interstellar medium (ISM) with processed material. In view of the theory of dynamical systems, the CDS can be considered as nonlinear multi-oscillatory systems, whose eigenfrequencies and normal modes are controlled by the intrinsic time scales of various coupled physical and chemical processes. The aim of this work is to investigate the complex dynamical behaviour of carbon-rich CDSs in great detail. This is done by established methods of non-linear dynamics such as Fourier Analysis and the study of stroboscopic and Poincar\u00e9 maps. Especially CDSs surrounding stars with large stellar luminosities, tend to become dynamically unstable. They develop a self-maintaining oscillatory pattern purely caused by dust formation even without additional input of energy and mechanical momentum from the star (exterior ?-mechanism). Such a system has obviously an eigenmode...",

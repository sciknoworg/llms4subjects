            "abstract": "With our human self-reflection we embody the fact that the Universe thinks about itself. About 13.75 billion years after a Big Bang, dead matter became something that is able to say \"Je pense, donc je suis.\", or \"I think, therefore I am\". For several thousands of years, we are wondering what it means 'to be', what that is which has being, where did it all come from and -- why. In quest of answers to these questions, some dig into the shortest scales of matter, so they may penetrate the power that holds the Universe together. Others study the forms of life or explore the human brain, some believe in an omnipotence and some, finally, use devices to look deep into the sky. About 20 years ago, these stargazers -- astronomers, who used to name celestial objects in former times, and astrophysicists, who study their physical qualities -- discovered the first planet that orbits a distant star. Over the intervening years, the number of such confirmations has increased to several hundreds. Moreover, scientists discovered objects, which are neither stars nor planets, but have intermediate masses. These 'brown dwarfs' constitute the connecting link between the two regimes. And both, stars as well as planets, can only be understood comprehensively in their context with brown dwarfs...",

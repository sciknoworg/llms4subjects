            "abstract": "The orexin system plays an important role in many physiological processes such as regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, emotions, pain, or the reward system and is, therefore, a promising drug target for the treatment of various related diseases.56, 63 The crystal structures of the orexin receptors both in complex with the approved drug suvorexant were the basis for this work.110-111 Employing a structure-based drug design approach, we aimed to exploited single amino acid sequence differences between the two receptor subtypes to develop new orexin receptor antagonists based on the structure of suvorexant with improved biological properties. Alkyl-substituted desmethyl-suvorexant analogs Selective OX1R antagonists (1-SORAs) are promising drug candidates for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders such as addiction, depression, and anxiety.63 We aimed to develop 1-SORAs in a structure-based approach based on the structure of the dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) suvorexant, employing the crystal structures of the orexin receptors both in complex with suvorexant.110-111 We exploited a single A/T3.33 sequence difference between the two subtypes by introducing alkyl substituents to the ligand scaffold. These substituents should fill the available space in the OX1R binding pocket with the alanine in position 33 of TM3 (A3.33) but clash with the bulkier threonine side chain (T3.33) of the OX2R. The previously developed ex-chiral pool synthetic route,115-116 starting from amino acid methyl esters bearing the desired substituent as a side chain, was optimized to allow the synthesis of the ligands in a gram-scale. The synthetic approach started with a Michael addition and included catalytic hydrogenation, ester hydrolysis, lactamization, reduction, oxidative coupling, cleavage of a protective group, and amide coupling (Figure 40). Employing this synthetic route, we successfully synthesized 13 alkyl-substituted desmethyl-suvorexant analogs. Among those compounds, three ligands (JH060, JH220, and JH221) have been ...",

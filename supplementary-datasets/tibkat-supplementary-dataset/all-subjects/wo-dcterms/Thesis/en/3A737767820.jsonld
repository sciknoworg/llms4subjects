            "abstract": "This dissertation builds on the economic research about M&A and the effects on the merging plants' performance. In particular, the objective of this thesis is to shed some light on questions about causal effects of M&A on plants' performance, taking firm heterogeneity into account. Since there is no typical merger (Tichy, 2001) it distinguishes between acquiring and target plants, and between horizontal and non-horizontal mergers. The thesis focuses on two major research questions: do plants with specific characteristics self-select in merger activity, and is there a causal effect of M&A on the merging plants' performance parameters, in particular on labor productivity, employment, and skill-intensity? The results allow drawing some conclusions about the reasons why plants merge. The thesis consists of four chapters. All contributions have in common that they focus on questions about the effects of M&A on plant performance. That is, the thesis does not discuss questions about the effects of M&A on industry and aggregation concentration levels, or the effects of M&A on social welfare. Each chapter in this thesis can be read separately, because they are based on stand-alone papers. Hence, all chapters have their own introduction and conclusion. The structure and storyline of this thesis and the interaction of the chapters are as follows: the first chapter is a survey about M&A and acts as an introduction to this research field. The second chapter describes propensity score matching as a newer microeconometric evaluation method and explains its implementation in the econometric computer software STATA. In a certain sense, the second chapter serves as a preparation for a better understanding of the econometric analysis performed in chapters three and four, which form the heart of the thesis. They both discuss questions about self-selection of plants into merger activity, and questions about causal effects on plants' performance. In particular, the third chapter focuses on the effects on merging plants' labor productivity, while the fourth chapter focuses on the effects on both employment and skill-intensity. Even if both chapters discuss the effects on different performance parameters, they are similar with respect to motivation, structure, and estimation strategy. Hence, there is some inevitable overlapping between these two chapters which are based on stand-alone papers as mentioned above",

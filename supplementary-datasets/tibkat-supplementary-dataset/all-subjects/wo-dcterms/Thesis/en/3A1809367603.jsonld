            "abstract": "Viruses, especially emerging and re-emerging positive-sense single-stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) viruses, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have caused several epidemic and pandemic outbreaks in the last decades. There are only few approved antiviral drugs available against (+)ssRNA viruses and they rarely show sufficient efficacy when repurposed against emerging viruses. The major drug target in viruses is the viral replication machinery, i.e. the replication-transcription complex (RTC), which is responsible for the synthesis of the viral genome and as such is a vital part in the replication cycle of the virus. Most antiviral drugs that target the RTC are nucleotide analogs, which are modified natural nucleotides that can be used as substrate for RNA synthesis by the RTC. They can e.g. inhibit RNA product extension or induce mutations. To find (new) effective nucleotide analogs against the viral RTC, it is necessary to understand how the RTC incorporates naturally occurring nucleotides, which parts of this process are influenced by the incorporation of nucleotide analogs and how the nucleotide analogs affect RNA synthesis dynamics. The incorporation of a nucleotide analog is a rare event, similar to mismatch incorporation, that happens asynchronous between different RTCs. These events are hidden in standard biochemical bulk assays in the presence of competing natural nucleotides at physiological concentration. Single-molecule techniques by contrast allow for the observation of single enzymes, which in turn enables us to observe rare events, even in the presence of saturating concentrations of the competing natural nucleotides. Here, we used high-throughput magnetic tweezers as a single molecule force spectroscopy technique for the simultaneous observation of hundreds of RNA template, which therefore allows for the rapid collection of large statistics. A pair of permanent magnets exerts an attractive force to magnetic beads, which are tethered to the surface of a flow chamber ...",

            "abstract": "Prediction of contaminant transport in karst aquifers is therefore challenging and requires the knowledge of flow characteristics and transport processes in these systems. Based in this information, quantitative vulnerability concepts can be established, which are a prerequisite for management of karst water resources and conservation of their quality. The present thesis investigates indicator parameters of intrinsic and specific vulnerability in karst aquifers through the characterization of karst systems based on spring responses and integrated numerical Modelling at a catchment scale. Spring responses include discharge and chemographs and reflect the integrated response of all the flow and transport processes occurring in a system. For this purpose flow in a well investigated karst system was first numerically simulated using the Mike She software (DHI). The spatially distributed model accounts for all the physical processes taking place in the hydrological cycle, and therefore considers all the compartments of a karst system (atmosphere, unsaturated zone, and saturated zone). The physical or empirical parameters involved in the model, which play a role in the shape of the flow response and its transmission, were delineated through an extensive sensitivity analysis ...",

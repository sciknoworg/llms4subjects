            "abstract": "A novel and well-characterized model system has been developed and used in order to extract mechanistic insights on the SNARE-mediated fusion process. The reconstitution of SNAREs onto large liposomes mediated by n-octyl-\u00df-D-glucoside (OG) was characterized according to size, protein orientation and insertion efficiency. This resulted in SNARE-liposomes with good reconstitution properties that were in the 100 nm range. To induce relatively fast lipid-mixing and observe substantial size increments, it was found essential to stabilize a 1:1 syntaxin\u00b7SNAP-25 acceptor complex with a C-terminal synaptobrevin fragment (denoted DeltaN syb), which provided a fast nucleation site for trans SNARE complex formation. The kinetics of lipid-mixing was found to be governed by the displacement of Delta N syb from the syntaxin\u00b7SNAP-25 acceptor complex, which gave rise to a transient but long-lived docking state which could be kinetically resolved from fusion ...",

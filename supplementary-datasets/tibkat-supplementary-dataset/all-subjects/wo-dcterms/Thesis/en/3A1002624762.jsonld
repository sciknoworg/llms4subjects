            "abstract": "Abstract: In the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, hundreds of transcripts were found that originate from genomic regions without annotation, suggesting their association with novel and unexplored functions. Some of these transcripts are non-coding RNAs with regulatory functions, while others are short mRNAs, encoding \u00b5-proteins (proteins \u226480 amino acids). Six examples, called norf1, nsiR6, hliR1, norf4, ssr1169 and ssl2823, which were supposed to belong to the latter category, exhibited intriguing modi of expression and appeared as promising candidates for further investigation. First the expression patterns of norf1, nsiR6 and hliR1, which were expected to be specifically expressed under a certain condition, as well as the expression of norf4 in response to nitrogen starvation was studied in more detail. A previously supposed upregulation of norf1 expression in the dark could be verified via Northern blot analysis. Likewise, the nsiR6 transcript was highly induced under nitrogen starvation. The norf4 mRNA was found to overlap the gap1 mRNA on the complementary DNA strand by several hundred nucleotides. Both mRNAs showed a mild upregulation upon the removal of nitrogen, suggesting a co-regulation of the two transcripts. The expression of hliR1 was highly induced under high light and seemed to be associated with sodB expression. To verify the coding potential of the six transcripts, the translation of the predicted small open reading frames (sORFs) was pursued by the construction of mutant strains expressing FLAG-tagged versions and subsequent immunoblotting. After induction of expression via the Cu2+-responsive petE promoter or from their native promoters, all six <br>\u00b5-proteins were detected.<br>The work then focused on the functional characterization of the previously unknown small protein Norf1, which attracted particular attention due to its high expression in the dark distinguishing it from the vast majority of genes. A loss of function mutant and several overexpression strains were generated to screen different environmental conditions in the course of physiological characterization. Affinity purification of FLAG fusion proteins and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified ATP synthase subunits as putative binding partners of Norf1. This was further substantiated by finding AtpB to be co-purified with FLAG-tagged Norf1 and Norf1 to be co-purified with FLAG-tagged AtpB in the inverted approach, indicating a possible regulat ...",

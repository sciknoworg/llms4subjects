            "title": "Calcium signalling in pruritus and melanoma",
            "abstract": "This thesis focuses on unsolved questions regarding cellular signalling in different contexts, especially in diseases. Several problems concerning different pathologies are approached applying the widely used method of calcium imaging. Since calcium is an important messenger in cellular signalling, the increase of intracellular calcium levels indicate the reaction of the cell to an external stimulus. The large variety of stimuli, such as substances but also temperature or light, allow for a wide application in the investigation of cellular responses. Besides, with its high temporal resolution and wide field of view, calcium imaging allows the simultaneous observation of physiological phenomena in a high number of cells. This thesis consists of three parts. First, we investigate different questions regarding pruritus or itch, which is a common symptom in hepatobiliary disorders. The focus of the first publication is on signalling pathways activated by Lysophosphatidic Acid. Lysophosphatidic Acid is suspected to cause pruritus in patients with hepatobiliary diseases. The activated signalling pathway is therefore of great interest, as the options of pharmacological treatment are limited. We are able to show, that Lysophosphatidic Acid does not activate neuronal cells but the surrounding glia cells and also identify the corresponding receptor. In a second publication we further investigate possible targets for pharmaceutical treatment of pruritus: Ion-channels linked to the propagation of sensory signals. Thereby, we address the function of voltage-gated sodium channels by testing different known pruritogens in vitro and in vivo in mice. This allows us to conclude the involvement of several channels in pruritus. These findings could be an important step towards the development of a potential drug against itch. The second project explores the effect of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) on melanoma cells. We are especially interested in intracellular effects and activated signalling mechanisms.

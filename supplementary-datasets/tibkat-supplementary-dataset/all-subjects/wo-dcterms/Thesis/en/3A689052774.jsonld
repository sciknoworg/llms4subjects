            "abstract": "Transition-metal-catalyzed direct arylations have emerged as a viable alternative to traditional cross coupling chemistry in recent decades, as they constitute an economically attractive strategy for an overall streamlining of sustainable syntheses. Thus, the main focus of the present work was set on the development of generally applicable methodologies for site-selective formations of C-C bonds through direct C-H bond functionalizations. In the first part an efficient and generally applicable protocol for palladium-catalyzed direct C-H bond arylations of electron-deficient heteroarenes with aryl and alkenyl sulfonates was elaborated. The optimized catalytic system provided the direct arylation products with excellent chemo- and site-selectivites in high isolated yields. Various tosylates, as well as more atom-economical aryl mesylates could be successfully used as inexpensive, moisture-stable electrophiles for C-H bond functionalizations. Remarkably, the highly-active catalytic system also allowed the direct arylations of electron-deficient fluoroarenes with deactivated tosylates. In a second project of this thesis, research efforts were directed towards sustainable ruthenium-catalyzed annulations of alkynes by benzhydroxamic acid esters ...",

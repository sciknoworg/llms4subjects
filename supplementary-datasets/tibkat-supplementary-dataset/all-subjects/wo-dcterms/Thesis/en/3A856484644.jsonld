                "Animals exploit complex environments in an optimal way, often with limited brain capacities. Interestingly, it is largely unknown, how they do so. This thesis comprises five studies investigating proximate mechanisms modulating the searching behaviour of parasitoid wasps. These organisms serve as excellent organisms for such questions due to their tight link of searching success and fitness. While the first study assumed a simple motor response to serve as a heuristic, yet effective, mechanism, the remaining studies focussed on the role of octopamine [OA] and dopamine [DA]. Both substances being essential in the assessment of reward and aversive stimuli, respectively. Neither the assumed motor response could be met nor did OA or DA reveal any consistent effects with respect to the assessment of rewards and costs. DA slightly impacted the movement pattern. Treatment with OA revealed numerous effects, in total indicating an influence on stress level. Both is in line with studies on other species. Yet, although OA significantly influences searching behaviour, the underlying mechanism is considerably more complex than initially assumed. Last, it was shown that a generalisation on the basis of a few studies and stimuli with respect to the role of OA in the integration of rewards is a simplification.",

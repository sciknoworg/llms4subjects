            "abstract": "Abstract: This book presents a corpus-based comparison of tense and aspect usage in Chinese learner English and German learner English. It combines quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis in a research design to understand how language transfer operates in the context of other factors relevant for the learning process. The corpus-based study presents the data and the general trends in learner Englishes from the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE), comparing them to the Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays (LOCNESS), and analyzes underuse and overuse of tense-aspect forms. The learner errors, most prominent errors, intralingual errors and transfer errors, the L1-specific and universal acquisition features in Chinese learner English and German learner English are listed and explained. Comparisons between Chinese learner English and German learner English are made to understand language transfer in acquiring English tense and aspect. Based on the corpus findings, an experiment is carried out to understand Chinese students\u2019 and German students\u2019 knowledge about tense and aspect, their perspectives on different actions or situations and the statistical relationship between L1 transfer and learners\u2019 perceptions.<br><br>The research produces a comprehensive view of tense and aspect in Chinese learner English and German learner English, links the research on Chinese learner English to that on German learner English, gains some further insights about L1-specific and universal acquisition features, makes contributions to research on language transfer and second language acquisition and delivers advice for pedagogical practice",

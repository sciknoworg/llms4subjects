            "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation, diazotroph, nifH, sugarcane, mopane, rice, LNA. - Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a process exclusively carried out by a group of prokaryotes known as diazotrophs that possess the enzyme nitrogenase. This enzyme converts Nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3), which can then be assimilated by plants for growth. The study of active diazotrophic bacterial communities in natural environments has been carried out using both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. This thesis focuses on the active nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with the roots of non-legume and legume plants, specifically sugarcane (a principal crop for sugar and biofuel production) and the South African legume tree, mopane (used as animal feed and for domestic purposes in the region). The presence of the nifH gene, which encodes for the iron protein of the nitrogenase complex, has been widely used as a functional and phylogenetic marker to indicate nitrogen fixation in the environment. In order to improve nifH gene detection, the effect of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) substituted primers in RNA extracts from roots of rice and sugarcane was studied by direct reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It was found that the use of an LNA modified RT primer increases the sensitivity and efficiency of RT-PCR reactions and therefore allowed the detection of nifH transcripts where DNA primers alone failed to produce RT-PCR products. RT-PCR was then used to detect active diazotrophs in sugarcane root samples from Africa and America. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles showed a low diversity of diazotrophs in all samples locations. A major nifH phylotype was found to have a high DNA sequence identity (93.9 99.6%) with the partial nifH sequence from Rhizobium rosettiformans, which belongs to a genus typically found in legume plants. The prevalence of this globally distributed nifH phylotype indicates a tight interaction between the corresponding nitrogen fixing ...",

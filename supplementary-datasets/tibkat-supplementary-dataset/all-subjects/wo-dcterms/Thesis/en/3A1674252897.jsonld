            "abstract": "The main objective of this PhD thesis is to obtain theoretical and empirical insights on how users cope with the dark side of information technology (IT) use. The dark side of IT use has a negative impact on the well-being of users and the productivity of organizations. However, psychological literature claims that individuals also tend to cope with negative events. To begin, the thesis investigates the dark side of IT use within different contexts and focuses on different outcomes. Subsequently, the effect of different coping strategies on the dark side of IT use is investigated. The findings demonstrate that the sources of the dark side of IT use in terms of IT events are influenced by different characteristics across contexts. The dissertation demonstrates that users perform coping strategies to manage the dark side of IT use, yet, the coping effect depends on inter-individual differences. These coping strategies are not all equal; instead, they can be differentiated depending on their method and focus. Also, users respond to IT events and the resultant responses differently by performing proactive and reactive coping. Moreover, the thesis gives insights into the longitudinal effects of coping with the dark side of IT use. The results lead to several contributions for information systems literature and provide implications for practitioners.",

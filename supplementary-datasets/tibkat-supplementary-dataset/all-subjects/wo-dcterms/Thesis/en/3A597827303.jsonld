            "abstract": "Paleoclimate dynamics, insolation forcing, Milankovitch, teleconnections, climate prediction. - A concept for the physical understanding of insolation-driven temperature variability on orbital timescales is developed. It relies on the observed annual cycle of temperature to estimate the climate's sensitivity to local insolation at different seasons. Based on this concept, the temperature evolution of the last 750 ky related to local insolation forcing is estimated. The seasonal template model largely reproduces the Holocene temperature trends as simulated by a coupled climate model. It predicts significant temperature variability in the eccentricity and semipreccession frequency band in the tropics and indicates that the temperature response to local insolation is highly spatially dependent. In explaining observed climate variability, the local time-independent approach complements the global Milankovitch hypothesis (climate variations are driven by northern summer insolation) and potentially offers new insights in interpreting paleoclimate records. The interpretation of the proxy records is complicated by the seasonality inherent in many climate proxies. As this interferes with the seasonal temperature signal, the true climate response has to be isolated from the recorder effect when interpreting the proxy data. This is demonstrated on the example of Antarctic temperature records. Reconstructed Antarctic temperatures from ice cores are nearly in phase with the boreal summer insolation but out of phase with the local summer insolation. Therefore, Antarctic climate is often thought to be driven by northern summer insolation although a clear mechanism that links the two hemispheres on this timescale is missing. Here, an alternative hypothesis ...",

            "abstract": "Natural resource tenure, environmental governance, Indonesia, community-based forestry, payments for environmental services. - The dissertation examines change and complexity in evolving systems of environmental governance in Indonesia, and explores interactions with resource tenure. The aim is to better understand how and why different actors have negotiated and contested resource tenure under conditions of changing environmental governance. The dissertation elaborates a notion of dynamic hybridity in environmental governance and resource tenure systems. The dissertation draws on three empirical case studies and focuses mainly on the period from the late 1990s through to 2015. The cases were geographically disbursed and covered the loosely categorized ideal states of state-led management, community-based management, and payments for environmental services. The findings show how different analytical and theoretical perspectives - for example, a more nuanced focus on trust between actors, considering ideational changes as captured in the changing values of resources, and the \"bundle of rights approach\" to understanding property rights - can explicitly encourage a temporal (dynamic) perspective in analyzing changes in resource tenure and environmental governance.",

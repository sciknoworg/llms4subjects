            "abstract": "High consequence severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) is the youngest among known human coronaviruses. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may cause severe disease in humans (COVID\u201019) and has affected every\u2010day life in an unprecedented manner. Total number of cases and fatalities have reached an inconceivable level within only two years after the index case and are still increasing. The zoonotic SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has emerged in an animal reservoir and was transmitted to humans, triggering a pandemic wave. Besides humans, also some animal species have shown very high susceptibility towards infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, which can also lead to severe clinics in these species. Another major factor in COVID\u201019 pandemic is the continuing evolution of the virus and the ongoing emergence of new viral variants. The first year of the pandemic with its undamped SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spread has accentuated the importance for countermeasures to temper further dissemination and protect humans \u2013 most ideally with potent vaccines. Additionally, an improved understanding of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 biology, evolution, and emergence will be eminent to substantiate efficient control of COVID\u201019. Animal models are a substantial cornerstone on which research efforts are based. They are unexcelled to modulate pathogenesis and epidemiology of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in a true\u2010to\u2010life approach. This cumulative thesis introduces, establishes, discusses, and synergizes three experimental settings in different animal models, to substantially add to knowledge in indexing animals' susceptibility for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, characterizing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants of concern, and testing vaccine\u2010candidates. Species susceptibility towards infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was tested in an experimental transmission study, with directly inoculated donor animals. To test for transmission, virus\u2010 na\u00efve contact animals were co\u2010housed one day post inoculation. Subsequently, all animals were checked for clinical signs and relevant clinical specimen were collected. With this approach, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in cattle and ...",

            "abstract": "The concept of targeting cells and tissues by controlled delivery of molecules is essential in the field of biomedicine. The layer-by-layer (LbL) technology for the fabrication of polymer multilayer films is widely implemented as a powerful tool to assemble tailor-made materials for controlled drug delivery. The LbL films can as well be engineered to act as mimics of the natural cellular microenvironment. Thus, due to the myriad possibilities such as controlled cellular adhesion and drug delivery offered by LbL films, it becomes easily achievable to direct the fate of cells by growing them on the films. The aim of this work was to develop an approach for non-invasive and precise control of the presentation of bioactive molecules to cells. The strategy is based on employment of the LbL films, which function as support for cells and at the same time as reservoirs for bioactive molecules to be released in a controlled manner. UV light is used to trigger the release of the stored ATP with high spatio-temporal resolution. ...",

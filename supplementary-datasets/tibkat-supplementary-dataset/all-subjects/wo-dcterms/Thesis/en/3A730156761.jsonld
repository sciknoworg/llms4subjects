            "abstract": "Circadian timing systems evolved in most organisms to adapt to the daily alternation of light and dark and the accompanying changes of environmental parameters such as food availability and predator occurrence. Circadian clocks allow organisms to anticipate these changes, which in turn increases their evolutionary fitness. The first part of this thesis describes the generation and validation of a new genetic mouse model of central clock disruption. It is assumed, that the mammalian circadian timing system is hierarchically organized with a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and subordinated clocks in peripheral tissues. This view is based on SCN ablation studies showing that in the absence of the SCN all peripheral clocks become arrhythmic. An obvious flaw of SCN ablations is the concomitant scission of SCN afferents and efferents. Here we use a genetic model of SCN clock disruption. We generated a SCN Cre driver mouse line (Syt10Cre) and demonstrated strong Cre activity in the majority of SCN cells, but none in peripheral tissues with the exception of the testis. The Syt10Cre driver line was functionally validated by deleting a conditional allele of the essential clock gene Bmal1 (Bmal1fl/fl). Syt10Cre Bmal1fl mice were analyzed for their wheel running behavior in light dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD) conditions. We found a dose-dependent phenotype ranging from minor changes in period and amplitude in Syt10Cre/+ Bmal1fl/fl to markedly reduced rhythmicity in Syt10Cre/+ Bmal1fl/- mice to a complete loss of circadian rhythmicity in Syt10Cre/Cre Bmal1fl/- mice. The behavioral phenotype of Syt10Cre/Cre Bmal1fl/- mice was indistinguishable from the phenotype of Bmal1-/- mice, confirming the efficiency of SCN disruption ...",

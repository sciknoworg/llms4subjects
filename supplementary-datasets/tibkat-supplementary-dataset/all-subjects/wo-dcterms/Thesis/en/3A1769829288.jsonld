            "abstract": "The overall objectives of this thesis were 1) to determine the association between the timing of artificial insemination (AI) and different characteristics of an estrus event (i.e., onset, peak, and end) using an automated activity monitoring (AAM) system on pregnancy per AI (P/AI) in lactating Holstein cows inseminated with either fresh or frozen semen, 2) to identify plausible factors associated with estrous expression and subsequent P/AI in lactating Holstein cows using an AAM system, and 3) to evaluate two modifications (i.e., double dose, second administration 24 h apart) of the prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF) treatment using cloprostenol in a 7-d Ovsynch protocol compared with a standard single PGF dose on progesterone (P4) concentration at the time of the second GnRH treatment (G2) and P/AI in lactating Holstein cows. To determine the association between the timing of AI with either fresh or frozen semen and different characteristics of an estrus event (i.e., onset, peak, and end) using an AAM system on P/AI, an observational study was conducted on 4 commercial dairy farms in Germany. The evaluation included a total of 3,607 AI services based on the alert of a neck-mounted AAM system (Heatime; SCR Engineers Ltd., Netanya, Israel). Pregnancy diagnosis was performed following farm individual strategies either by transrectal palpation 38 \u00b1 3 d after AI or by transrectal ultrasonography 30 \u00b1 3 d after AI. To evaluate whether cows were exposed to heat stress, loggers were installed within the barns that continuously recorded ambient temperature and relative humidity, thereby calculating the temperature-humidity-index (THI). The software of the AAM system converted individual cow's raw activity data into an activity change index value using a proprietary algorithm. These index values ranged from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest). Onset of estrus (OE) was defined as a cow exceeding an activity change index value of 35. End of estrus (EE) was defined by the first instance at which the index value fell below 35 again. The ...",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Intestinal bacteria influence gut morphology by affecting epithelial cell proliferation, development of the lamina propria, villus length and crypt depth [1]. Gut microbiota-derived factors have been proposed to also play a role in the development of a 30 % longer intestine, that is characteristic of PRM/Alf mice compared to other mouse strains [2, 3]. Polyamines and SCFAs produced by gut bacteria are important growth factors, which possibly influence mucosal morphology, in particular villus length and crypt depth and play a role in gut lengthening in the PRM/Alf mouse. However, experimental evidence is lacking. Aim: The objective of this work was to clarify the role of bacterially-produced polyamines on crypt depth, mucosa thickness and epithelial cell proliferation. For this purpose, C3H mice associated with a simplified human microbiota (SIHUMI) were compared with mice colonized with SIHUMI complemented by the polyamine-producing Fusobacterium varium (SIHUMI + Fv). In addition, the microbial impact on gut lengthening in PRM/Alf mice was characterized and the contribution of SCFAs and polyamines to this phenotype was examined. Results: SIHUMI + Fv mice exhibited an up to 1.7 fold higher intestinal polyamine concentration compared to SIHUMI mice, which was mainly due to increased putrescine concentrations. However, no differences were observed in crypt depth, mucosa thickness and epithelial proliferation. In PRM/Alf mice, the intestine of conventional mice was 8.5 % longer compared to germfree mice. In contrast, intestinal lengths of C3H mice were similar, independent of the colonization status. The comparison of PRM/Alf and C3H mice, both associated with SIHUMI + Fv, demonstrated that PRM/Alf mice had a 35.9 % longer intestine than C3H mice. However, intestinal SCFA and polyamine concentrations of PRM/Alf mice were similar or even lower, except N acetylcadaverine, which was 3.1-fold higher in PRM/Alf mice. When germfree PRM/Alf mice were associated with a complex PRM/Alf microbiota, the intestine was one quarter longer compared to PRM/Alf mice colonized with a C3H microbiota. This gut elongation correlated with levels of the polyamine N acetylspermine. Conclusion: The intestinal microbiota is able to influence intestinal length dependent on microbial composition and on the mouse genotype. Although SCFAs do not contribute to gut elongation, an influence of the polyamines N acetylcadaverine and N acetylspermine is conceivable. In addition, the study clearly demonstrated that bacterial putrescine does not influence gut morphology in C3H mice.",

            "abstract": "Fishery, Arabic Sea, Population Dynamics, Stock assessment, Seabream, Cheimerius nufar. -The thesis focuses on the biology and fishery assessment of Santer Seabream, Cheimerius nufar (Valenciennes,1830) in relation to certain environmental parameters influence in the Arabian Sea off Oman between April 2005-March 2007 and Sept 2007 Sept 2008. The fish occurred at temperatures between 20o\u0331C and 24o\u0331C and appeared to adapt to low oxygen level during different periods. The female and male mature at 31.9cm and 33.7cm TL respectively. The fish Spawn during May October. The estimated age based on length frequency and otolith is11 years and13 years respectively. The calculated length at capture was 31.4cm and about 67.4% of the fish in the commercial catches measured < 34cm.The estimated total mortality, natural mortalityand fishing mortalitywere 1.3, 0.62 and 0.68 respectively. The C. nufar stock is marginally overexploited. The average fish size to be caught may be restricted to 36cm TL. A reduction of 17% of effort from the present level is recommended.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this thesis is the quantum dynamical study of two examples of scanning tunneling microscope (STM)-controllable, Si(100)(2x1) surface-mounted switches of atomic and molecular scale. The first example considers the switching of single H-atoms between two dangling-bond chemisorption sites on a Si-dimer of the Si(100) surface (Grey et al., 1996). The second system examines the conformational switching of single 1,5-cyclooctadiene molecules chemisorbed on the Si(100) surface (Nacci et al., 2008). The temporal dynamics are provided by the propagation of the density matrix in time via an according set of equations of motion (EQM). The latter are based on the open-system density matrix theory in Lindblad form. First order perturbation theory is used to evaluate those transition rates between vibrational levels of the system part. In order to account for interactions with the surface phonons, two different dissipative models are used, namely the bilinear, harmonic and the Ohmic bath model. IET-induced vibrational transitions in the system are due to the dipole- and the resonance-mechanism. A single surface approach is used to study the influence of dipole scattering and resonance scattering in the below-threshold regime. Further, a second electronic surface was included to study the resonance-induced switching in the above-threshold regime. Static properties of the adsorbate, e.g., potentials and dipole function and potentials, are obtained from quantum chemistry and used within the established quantum dynamical models.",

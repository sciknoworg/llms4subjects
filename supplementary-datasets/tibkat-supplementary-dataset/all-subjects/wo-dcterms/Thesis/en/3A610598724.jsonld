            "abstract": "This thesis describes research on atomic structure and molecular dynamics of biomolecules in the solid phase using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A method for detecting residue-specific mobility using double-quantum (13C,13C) spectroscopy was developed on a small model system and applied to the 76-residue protein ubiquitin. Together with a structure calculation employing an automated algorithm, results allowed to relate preparation-dependent chemical-shift changes in this protein to local differences in mobility or conformation. Work on the potassium channel KcsA-Kv1.3 in lipid bilayers led to resonance assignments for 59% of its residues. Secondary structure of its pore domain was found to closely resemble that of the parent KcsA channel, but differences became apparent with respect to KcsA preparations in micelles, highlighting the influence of the membrane environment. In close reference to functional experiments, activation and inactivation gating in KcsA-Kv1.3 and their dependence on pH and potassium concentration were investigated. At acidic pH, KcsA-Kv1.3 was found to reside in an open-inactivated conformation. It is characterized by bent inner transmembrane helices, corresponding to an opened activation gate, and by a nonconductive selectivity filter conformation, i.e. a closed inactivation gate. The open-inactivated state of KcsA-Kv1.3 was demonstrated to be correlated with protonation of specific glutamate residues ...",

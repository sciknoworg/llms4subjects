            "abstract": "This dissertation investigates key aspects of family development and identifies intervention opportunities to enhance family well-being. Focusing on three domains\u2014decision-making during childbirth, the establishment of stable childbearing unions, and effective parenting to prevent antisocial behavior\u2014three meta-analyses assess the efficacy of relationship education and parent training programs and investigate the correlational relationship between intrapartum decision-making and postpartum mental health. The perinatal care meta-analysis underscores the necessity for improved intrapartum decision-making, linking it to severe postpartum psychopathology. Recommendations include bolstering patient rights education for birthing individuals and refining decision-making practices among obstetric staff, aiming to positively impact postpartum mental health, mother-child relations, attachment, and overall family functioning. The results from two further meta-analyses emphasize the importance of relationship education and parent training programs. Both approaches showed effectiveness in improving relationships, enhancing parenting skills, and preventing antisocial behavior in children. However, the analysis on relationship education revealed a lack of studies involving vulnerable families, such as those with lower education and socio-economic status. Efforts should be made to enhance the recruitment of these families and ensure their inclusion in research and support programs to improve the effectiveness of relationship education across communities. The meta-analysis of parent training programs highlighted the need for improving long-term stability in program effects. This can be achieved through strategies like incorporating buffering sessions in interventions or developing approaches that integrate continuous learning and blending parent education with established family support systems.",

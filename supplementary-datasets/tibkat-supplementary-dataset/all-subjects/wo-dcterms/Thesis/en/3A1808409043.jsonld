            "abstract": "Interferons (IFNs) are manifold cytokines which are involved in the regulation of hundreds of genes regulating several biological processes including cell survival and proliferation, host-response to infection, immune modulation as well as cell death. Previous studies have identified IFNs as key cytokines during gastrointestinal disorders as they influence intestinal epithelial cell death, a hallmark of gastrointestinal inflammation and infection. However, the full scope of IFN-mediated cell death and its implication during gastrointestinal inflammation and infection is not fully understood and requires further molecular and functional investigations. Previous studies revealed Caspase 8 deficient (Casp8\u0394IEC) mice as a suitable model to investigate necroptosis in the context of Crohn's disease like inflammation and gastrointestinal infections. Interestingly, genetic susceptibility was sufficient to drive mild ileal inflammation and Paneth cell death, whereas environmental microbial factors determine location and extent of inflammatory lesions along the whole gastrointestinal tract in Casp8\u0394IEC mice [A]. Furthermore, STAT1 transcriptionally regulated necroptosis in the small intestine, but was not involved in intestinal inflammation. In contrast to this, STAT2 contributed to ileitis but not to Paneth cell death and dysfunction in the Caspase-8 deficient background. Moreover, results derived from experimentally induced colitis revealed that colonic tissue destruction and cell death was caused by necroptosis which was independent of STAT1 [C]. Surprisingly, during gastrointestinal infection, STAT1 orchestrated cell death in colonic tissue [D]. In summary, the presented studies provided molecular and functional evidence for a key role of IFN-STAT1 mediated regulated cell death during gastrointestinal inflammation and infection. STAT1 coordinates cell death in the small intestine and contributes to Paneth cell dysfunction, whereas the IFN-STAT1 axis in the colon highly depends on the disease context. Thus, the data ...",

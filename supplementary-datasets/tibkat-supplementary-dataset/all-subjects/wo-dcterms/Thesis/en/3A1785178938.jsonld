            "title": "On the field-induced transport of magnetic nanoparticles in incompressible flow",
            "abstract": "Based on Onsager's variational principle, the motion of superparamagnetic nanoparticles \u2013 which are suspended in an incompressible carrier fluid and subjected to an external magnetic field \u2013 is described by systems of partial differential quations. Various modeling assumptions lead to three different systems denoted by model GW\", \"model W\" and \"model B\". When proposed in our joint work (2019), \"model GW\" was \u2013 to the best of our knowledge \u2013 the first one to include evolution equations for the magnetization field and for the magnetic particle density \u2013 all of them are nonlinearly coupled to the magnetostatic and the Navier-Stokes equations. The other two models use algebraic equations to determine the magnetization based on the linearized Langevin formula and are derived by us for the purpose of comparison. In case of \"model W\", we assume that the suspension yields a single-phase flow with negligible mass of magnetic nanoparticles. The other model is derived under the assumption that fluid particles and magnetic particles set up a two-phase fluid. It shows similarities to the model from Himmelsbach et al. (2017). All three models follow a two-domain approach \u2013 considering the magnetic field on a possibly larger domain compared to the fluid domain \u2013 of which we expect higher accuracy in determining the total magnetic field. The case when the two domains coincide requires some slight changes which are discussed when needed. In contrast to other works in the mathematical literature, the boundary conditions of the magnetization equation in \"model GW\" are motivated by physical arguments only, not by practical aspects with respect to mathematical analysis. They entail H(div,curl)-regularity of the magnetic quantities \u2013 magnetization and (total) magnetic field \u2013 but possibly not H1-regularity. To establish existence of solutions to this model, the absence of H1-regularity is compensated by an intricate approximation procedure. For this, we give a meaning to the Kelvin force (m*nabla)h in the distributional sense. ...\"",

            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: Since Gram-positive have superseded Gram-negative bacteria as the most common cause for severe sepsis it is of very high concern to determine the substructures responsible for pathogenicity. Intra-peritoneal infection with an Enterococcus faecalis mutant, depleted of the glycosyltransferase BgsA resulting in accumulation of a monoglycosyl-diacylglycerol (MGlcDAG), was shown to substantially increase mortality in mice. The aim of the study was to analyze what was causing the phenotype. By purification of the accumulating MGlcDAG and subsequent structural analysis, it was found that the glycolipid had a similar structure as virulent glycolipids of other Gram-positive bacteria. However, in vivo experiments in accordance with previous results indicated that the glycolipid is not the substructure of interest. Hence, it was focused next on lipoproteins since they were debated lately to be a major pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) of Gram-positive bacteria. Indeed, it was observed that by inactivation of the prolipoprotein diacylglycerol transferase (lgt) in \u0394bgsA, TNF-\u03b1 induction in macrophages was abrogated. Here, the results show that oxidation of the thioether by hydrogen peroxide abolished release of TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages after stimulation with lipoproteins. Additionally, proteomic analysis of the cell membrane surface proteome revealed that 13 of a total of 40 upregulated proteins of E. faecalis \u0394bgsA were lipoproteins. Overall, the lipoprotein content was 35.8% in \u0394bgsA compared to only 9.4% in wild type bacteria. Lipoprotein extracts from the supernatant and the cell membrane surface of \u0394bgsA induced a 3-fold and 10-fold higher production of TNF-\u03b1, respectively, compared to the wild type. MS-shotgun analysis of the supernatant extract confirmed that TNF-\u03b1 induction was caused by an overall upregulation of lipoproteins and not overexpression by a defined lipoprotein. However, stimulation with the purified E. faecalis lipoprotein EF1641 revealed that this lipoprotein is a strong stimulator of TNF-\u03b1 and was even more potent than SitC, a well-studied lipoprotein from Staphylococcus aureus. As lipids of the cell membrane were shown to be involved in pathogenicity, it was focused next on the role of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis on growth and virulence in E. faecalis. The enzyme isomerase/dehydratase FabN catalyzes the first steps in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Deletion resulted in unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophy a ...",

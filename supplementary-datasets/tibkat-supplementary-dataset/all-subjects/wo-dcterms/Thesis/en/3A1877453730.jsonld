            "abstract": "Cellulose ethers are widely used as additives for food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products and building materials to influence physicochemical and rheological properties. These depend, among other things, on the chemistry of the substituent, the degree of substitution, and the distribution of substituents in the glucosyl unit, and along and over the polymer chains. The latter is determined by ESI\u2011MS analysis of oligosaccharide profiles. A correct quantification of all compounds of an oligosaccharide fraction is required to draw a representative conclusion. The basic prerequisite for this is that both discrimination effects during ionization and mass discrimination effects along the MS analysis pathway, consisting of ion transfer, mass analysis and detection, are excluded. Prior to analysis, the free OH\u2011groups of cellulose ethers are permethylated, using CD3I as an internal isotope label to determine the methyl pattern, and, for the first time in this work, 13CH3I. To avoid unspecific Na+\u2011complexation, the charge can also be fixed by reductive amination. So far, only limited plausible and overall consistent profiles have been obtained for hydroxyethyl (methyl) cellulose (HEMC) and hydroxypropyl (methyl) cellulose by ESI\u2011IT\u2011MS. The accuracy and precision was not independently verifiable for any derivative typ. Also for methylated glucans, a study of model compounds had raised the suspicion of mass discrimination effects. Using binary mixtures of representative model compounds for MC (methyl cellulose) and HE(M)C, defined by a reference analysis (HPLC\u2011UV), the influence of the voltage settings of the individual components of an ESI\u2011IT\u2011MS on the relative quantifiability of mass spectra was systematically investigated. With respect to ion transfer, the voltage at the exit of the transfer capillary was found to be critical for ions with m/z<600 (nozzle\u2011skimmer collision induced dissociation). The voltages of the octopoles should be set to allow a non\u2011selective transport over a wide m/z\u2011range. The particularly critical storage of analytes in the ion trap could be controlled after determining the m/z\u2011dependent interaction of octopole and ion trap voltage settings on ion intensity. Ion suppressions during ionization could be excluded. Based on these findings, it was possible to establish appropriate measurement methods for MC, HEMC and HEC, allowing a correct and robust quantification of oligosaccharide profiles. Minor bias due to a small separation of CH3/CD3 isotopologs in LC\u2011MS analysis showed that 13CH3 label provided the most robust results in determining the methyl distribution of cellulose ethers.",

            "abstract": "The fast depletion of non-renewable energy sources requires modern chemists to develop new industrial &#13;processes that are more efficient and environmentally sustainable. In this framework, the &#13;functionalization (e.g. hydroxylation) of abundant natural chemical feedstocks to form products of &#13;added value is a fundamental goal to achieve and requires increasing research efforts. Hydroxylation of &#13;earth-abundant hydrocarbons is a challenging process that natural enzymes can perform at ambient &#13;conditions and at impressively high rates. Inspired by natural iron-containing enzymes that activate &#13;dioxygen to hydroxylate organic substrates, chemists have developed both heme and non-heme model &#13;complexes to understand how natural intermediates can perform such reaction. In this work, two distinct &#13;series of non-heme iron-carbene model complexes were synthesized and fully characterized, providing &#13;insight on their electronic structure and reactivity. &#13;Building on previous results on an organometallic tetracarbene oxoiron(IV) model complex 3, which &#13;was investigated as a model for C\u2212H activation (in particular for hydrogen atom abstraction -HAA- &#13;reactions), a series of axially substituted analogues bearing trifluoroacetate (complex 4), chloride (5) &#13;and tert-butylthiolate (7) trans to the oxo group was synthesized to investigate the effect of axial ligand &#13;donation on the reaction rates of HAA. The substituted tetracarbene oxoiron(IV) complexes were fully &#13;characterized using UV/Vis, M\u00f6\u00dfbauer, IRPD spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and &#13;crystallography (in the case of 4), confirming their electronic structure and S = 1 spin ground state. &#13;IRPD investigations supported the presence of progressively stronger axial donors going from 3 to 5, &#13;showing a decrease of the Fe=O stretching frequency going from acetonitrile (in 3) to trifluoroacetate &#13;and chloride. Complexes 4 and 5 showed similar spectroscopic signatures compared to 3, suggesting &#13;that weak axial donors only partially affect the electronic structure of the complexes. However, when &#13;the axial position is occupied by a thiolate ligand, as in 7, both the optical spectra and the MB parameters &#13;evidence a major change of the electronic structure due to the strong \uf073- and \uf070- donor properties of the &#13;RS\u2212 group.  &#13;The series of complexes was investigated towards activation of the weak C\u2212H bonds of 1,4-&#13;cyclohexadiene (CHD), 9,10-dihydroanthracene (DHA) and xanthene. UV/Vis monitoring of the &#13;reaction of 4, 5 and 7 with excess CHD in acetonitrile at \u221240 \u00b0C suggested how the presence of axially-&#13;bound anions affect the reaction pathway, stabilizing the putative FeIII-OH intermediate and allowing &#13;for follow-up reactivity with the nascent substrate organic radical, in contrast to the behavior observed &#13;previously for 3. The rates of the HAA with all the substrates were measured in pseudo-first order &#13;conditions at temperature between \u221240 and 25 \u00b0C, and activation parameters for the reaction were &#13;derived. Interestingly, the presence of strong axial donors decreased the reaction rates compared to 3, &#13;&#13;&#13; &#13;&#13; &#13;&#13;in contrast to other known model complexes, possibly due to a different mechanism of the initial &#13;interaction with the substrates.  &#13;Additionally, HAA reactivity studies on the FeIII\u2212O\u2212FeIII dimeric tetracarbene complex 2, deriving from &#13;the decomposition of 3 at RT or from the exposition of the corresponding FeII monomer 1 to air, were &#13;conducted in order to shed light on a previously reported disproportionation equilibrium that allows for &#13;HAA reactivity to take place. For this, scrambling experiments were designed to confirm the presence &#13;of the equilibrium in solution. The disproportionation was shown to happened due to the attack of &#13;acetonitrile or other potential ligands on 2, triggering the conversion into 1 and 3. A structurally &#13;characterized adduct between complex 2 and two molecules of 3 provides support for the attack on the &#13;axial free position of 2 being the trigger for the disproportionation. &#13;Parallel to the studies on the tetracarbene complexes, the development of a new hybrid organometallic &#13;ligand system and its iron complexes was pursued. The novel hybrid macrocycle features both NHC &#13;ligation and N-donating groups, together with a redox-non innocent carbazole fragment. The hybrid &#13;macrocycle is able to stabilize FeII complexes in two different spin ground states: S = 0 (octahedral &#13;complex 12a) and S = 1 (square-pyramidal complex 12b) depending on the nature of axial ligands. &#13;Cyclovoltammetry measurements show the possibility to oxidize both complexes twice, with the first &#13;oxidation generating the S = 1/2 FeIII complex 13a and the S = 3/2 FeIII complex 13b, and the second &#13;removing the electron from the carbazole fragment of the ligand and generating two FeIII \uf070-radical &#13;cation species. All six complexes were fully characterized using a variety of spectroscopic, structural &#13;and magnetochemical techniques, and combination with DFT calculations confirmed the ability of this &#13;novel hybrid non-heme system to mimic the typical features of heme-like models. &#13;In the last part of the work, a redox series of Fe-NO complexes of the new hybrid ligand was synthesized &#13;and initial characterization of the {FeNO}8\u22126 + {FeNO}6(L\u25cf+) series was performed. This new non-&#13;heme {FeNO}x series could provide a solid basis to investigate the effect of redox-non innocent ligand &#13;scaffold on the electronic structure and reactivity of {FeNO} model complexes.$yLinzenz",

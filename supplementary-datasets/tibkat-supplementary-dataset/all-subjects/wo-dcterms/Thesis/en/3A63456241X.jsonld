However, the controlling mechanisms for carbon export from the surface ocean are still unclear. Studies of fecal pellet fluxes and retention have revealed that most pellets are degraded within the surface waters. However, the key degraders are poorly known. We observed copepods (Danish coastal waters) rejecting pellets immediately after capture, in some cases with pellet fragmentation as outcome. Therefore, coprorhexy (pellet fragmentation) seems the main impact by copepods, and they are not the key degraders. From size fractionation of a plankton community (\u00d6resund, Denmark), we identified large heterotrophic dinoflagellates as major pellet degraders in the upper ocean. In deeper waters bacterial degradation dominates, only limited by pellet residence time, which is hypothesized to be dependent on ballast minerals. Bacterial degradation (laboratory) was independent of ballast material whereas sinking velocity increased with denser diet, leading to <10-fold higher pellet carbon flux with coccolithophorid and diatom diets than with flagellate diet. We calculated vertical carbon fluxes from in situ profiles of marine snow and aggregate size-specific abundance measured during a ship cruise off Cape Blanc (Mauritania), using estimated sinking speeds and aggregate masses. Calculated fluxes agreed well with sediment trap data for the same area and period ...",

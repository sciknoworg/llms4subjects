            "abstract": "Abstract: The present thesis introduces a new methodological approach based on magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) which allows for analyzing the development and load-adapted strategy of plant  structures.  Thus,  the  application  of  MRI  could  be  extended  to  the  fields  of  functional  morphology,  biomechanics  and  biomimetics  of  plants.  MRI  allows  for  repetitive  non- destructive and non-invasive in vivo imaging of plant structures and entire plant organisms,  while  simultaneously  enabling  a  combined  spatial  analysis  of  the  functional  anatomy,  biomechanics and the development of plants. By this, it became possible to reveal the unique  development and load-adapted strategy of branch-stem-attachments of dragon trees (Dracaena  marginata).<br>Three-dimensional MR images of the unloaded and mechanically loaded condition of a branch- stem-attachment  were  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  analyzed  to  understand  the  complex  three-dimensional displacements of the outer surface and inner tissues of the plant structure.  The in vivo biomechanical experiments revealed a load-adapted placement of the mechanically  relevant vascular bundles with sclerenchymatic fiber caps in the branch-stem junction of D.  marginata.  Furthermore,  the  soft  (visco-elastic)  parenchyma  matrix  dissipates  compressive  stresses  and  strains  while  simultaneously  allowing  for  a  load-induced  reorientation  of  the  vascular bundles along the course of occurring stress trajectories. This results in a high tensile  resistance of the structure. In addition, the complex branch ontogeny could be simplified to  seven chronological ontogenetic stages that give unique three-dimensional insights into the  development  of  the  load-adapted  strategy  of  D.  marginata.  The  load-adapted  strategy  and  development of lateral organs of dragon trees and arborescent monocotyledons in general has  not been fully understood up to date.<br>Magnetic resonance imaging has proven to be a powerful method with great potential in the  field of functional morphology, biomechanics and biomimetics of plants and its wide range of  possible applications can be extended far beyond the framework of the present dissertation",

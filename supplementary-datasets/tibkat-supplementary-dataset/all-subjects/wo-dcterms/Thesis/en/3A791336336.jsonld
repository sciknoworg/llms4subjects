            "abstract": "In this cumulative thesis, the superposition of shear flow and thermal convection, namely mixed convection, is investigated experimentally. The experiments were performed in a cuboidal sample with aspect ratios Gamma_xz = length=height = 5 and Gamma_yz = width=height = 1. The sample was composed of a heatable bottom and coolable ceiling as well as air inlet and outlet channels, which are located on the same side and both span the whole length of the sample. Different measurement techniques were applied and four main results were obtained. The first main result is the finding of large-scale ...",

            "abstract": "This thesis is highlighted in the area of photon- and charge-management with focus on non-covalent electron donor-acceptor systems built around several different photoactive building blocks, on one hand, and 1-dimensional (1D) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), on the other hand. Particular attention is paid to the ability of photoactive building blocks to individualize SWCNTs, doping of SWCNTs, mode of the interactions between the two individual constituents, and the overall stability of the hybrid systems. Moreover, the selective interactions / functionalization between photoactive building blocks and SWCNTs with specific chirality are discussed using two differently prepared mechanically interlocked nanotubes (MINTs) systems as examples. The latter revealed a correlation between chiral selectivity and the molecular structure of the corresponding photoactive building blocks. A complete photophysical characterization of the individual constituents and the corresponding SWCNT hybrid systems by means of a broad range of spectroscopic(steady-state absorption, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopies) and microscopic (atomic force microscopy (AFM) and aberration corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy (AC-HRTEM)) techniques were performed. In particular, time-resolved transient absorption experiments with tunable excitation wavelengths and energies, ranging from femtosecond (fs) to microsecond (\u00b5s) regime stand at the forefront. They assist in understanding the mechanism that is associated with the generation and fade of the photoexcited states. A number of steady-state spectroscopic techniques in combination with microscopic techniques compliment the time-resolved measurements and round off the quest for a better understanding of the involved processes. The first two projects demonstrated the ability of the photoactive building blocks to non-covalently self-assemble onto the surface of SWCNTs driven by charge-transfer (CT) interactions. To this end, polymethine-based NIR dyes and porphyrins ...",

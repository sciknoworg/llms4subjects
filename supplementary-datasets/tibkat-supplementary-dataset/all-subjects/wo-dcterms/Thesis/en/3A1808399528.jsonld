            "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are a rare subpopulation of cells first identified in bone marrow with the potential to proliferate in plastic-adherent colonies and to generate de novo bone marrow stroma and its environment upon serial transplantation to heterotopic anatomical sites. Given their multipotency and self renewal competence, MSCs are prime prospective candidates for most modern musculoskeletal-tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches. Still, their envisioned therapeutic use is being questioned with concerns regarding their definition, characterization and integrative functions in vivo. It is well established that microenvironmental cues such as the extracellular matrix (ECM)-chemistry, the mechanical environment and local cellular and/or paracrine interactions critically control MSCs behavior. Yet, most of the scientific knowledge regarding the biology and therapeutic effect of MSCs originates from mechanistic in vitro studies where microenvironmental cues are hardly addressed. Therefore, manifestable changes in cell proliferation behavior and multilineage differentiation potential might be triggered that eventually compromise the translation of results to clinics. This thesis aims to address the complexity of MSCs interactions within the skeletal niche microenvironment in order to provide alternative methods to bypass the current MSCs in vitro culture limitations. Firstly, the influence of ECM-chemistry on MSCs behavior in vitro was explored by means of decellularized human bone models here established. Basal or osteogenic tailored cell-derived decellularized 2D matrices (dECM), proved to be suitable culture substrates for MSCs expansion by providing close-to-native cell-ECM interactions. Moreover, quantified morphological shape changes suggested a material osteo supportive potential, further functionally validated by observable spontaneous mineralization of MSCs. Aiming to identify novel intrinsic ECM regulatory features specific to the skeletal niche, 3D decellularized human ...",

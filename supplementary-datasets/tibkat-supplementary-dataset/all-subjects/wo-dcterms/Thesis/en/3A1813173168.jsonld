            "abstract": "A multitude of human tissues, such as bones, tendons, or muscles, are characterized by a hierarchical and highly ordered structure. In many cases, the loss of these tissues requires reconstruction using biocompatible replacement materials. In the field of bone replacement, the pore structure of the material has a crucial influence. Anisotropic porosity would have the advantage of facilitating the ingrowth of cells and newly formed blood vessels as well as the transport of nutrients. In this thesis, scaffolds with a highly ordered and anisotropic pore structure were fabricated using unidirectional freezing. Systematic investigations were carried out on biopolymer solutions (alginate and chitosan) to gain a deeper understanding of the freeze-structuring process. The knowledge gained was then applied to the development of anisotropically structured bone substitute materials. Here, the previously existing material platform for anisotropically structured calcium phosphates was extended to low-temperature phases such as calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) or the secondary phosphates monetite and brushite. After the implantation of a biomaterial, the inevitably triggered initial immune response plays a key role in the success of a graft, with immune cells such as neutrophils or macrophages being of particular importance. In this thesis, the influence of anisotropically structured alpha-TCP and CDHA scaffolds as well as their unstructured references on human monocytes/macrophages was investigated. Macrophages produced extracellular traps (ETs) due to mineral nanoparticles formed by the binding of phosphate and calcium ions to human platelet lysate. In particular, incubation of alpha-TCP samples in lysate containing cell culture medium resulted in pronounced particle formation and enhanced release of ETs. ; Eine Vielzahl menschlicher Gewebe, wie beispielsweise Knochen, Sehnen oder Muskeln, ist durch eine hierarchische und zum Teil hochgradig geordnete Struktur gekennzeichnet.

            "abstract": "The prolyl-4 hydroxylase domain enzymes 1-3 (PHD1-3) are involved in regulating the protein stability of the alpha ?subunit of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), which is the master regulator of oxygen-dependent gene expression. Increasing evidence has been found that the PHDs are involved in regulating additional, HIF-independent, oxygen-dependent signal transduction pathways. Additionally, several hints for isoform-specific functions of the PHDs were observed. Therefore, members of the Department of Cardiovascular Physiology performed a yeast two-hybrid screen in which the activating transcription factor-4 (ATF-4) was identified as a novel interaction partner of the oxygen sensor PHD3. ATF-4 is involved in the cellular stress response and its expression is shown to be induced by different stress signals. ATF-4 is also regulated by phosphorylation and at the level of protein stability ...",

            "abstract": "The pKa's of the ionizable amino acids are crucial for the function of many proteins as they are key factors that determine their electrostatic potential and its spatial distribution, often controlling and optimizing enzymatic catalysis. Further, during conformational motions pKa's and protonation states particularly of histidines may change. In established force field simulation, however, this effect is typically not included, and protonation states must therefore be either guessed or derived from experiment. There have been a number of approaches to include protonation effects within simulations in the past, mainly based on continuum electrostatics or implicit solvent molecular dynamics [1--3]. However, the continuum electrostatics method lack the effect of the hydrogen bonding and the entropy effects due to the dynamics of the protein and the solvent whereas the implicit solvent MD although capturing the dynamics, again misses the hydrogen bonding and entropy contribution that comes from the solvent ...",

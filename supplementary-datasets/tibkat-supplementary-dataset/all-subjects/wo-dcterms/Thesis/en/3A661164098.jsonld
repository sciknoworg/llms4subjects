            "abstract": "Endocytosis regulates multiple cellular processes, including the protein composition of the plasma membrane, intercellular signaling and cell polarity. Cell polarity is defined by asymmetric localization of membrane-associated protein complexes. Defects in endocytosis can lead to faulty distribution of polarity proteins and ultimately to the loss of cell polarity. The small GTPase Cdc42 has recently been described to regulate endocytosis of polarity proteins in Drosophila epithelial cells. While the role of Cdc42 in the regulation of early endocytotic steps is quite well described, it is still not known how Cdc42 influences late endosome formation. Here I describe Rush hour (Rush), a previously uncharacterized and highly conserved protein that genetically interacts with Cdc42 in regulation of late endosome formation. Rush is a lipid interacting protein and localizes to the lateral plasma membrane of epithelial cells and to late endosomes. Rush promotes late endosome formation and rush mutants have a decreased late endosome size. Rush interacts with Cdc42 in regulation of endocytosis of the apical polarity protein Crumbs, and loss of rush rescued the phenotype caused by overexpression of dominant negative Cdc42. Rush binds directly to Rab GDI and could regulate endocytosis by affecting Rab activation on the membrane of late endosomes. Lysosomal marker staining is decreased in Rush overexpressing cells, indicating that Rush might regulate the transition between late endosomes and lysosomes. In addition, Rush causes fractionation of enlarged early endosomes that are formed by overexpression of constitutively active Rab5. These results suggest that Rush might act in trafficking steps both from the early to late endosomes and from late endosomes to lysosomes.",

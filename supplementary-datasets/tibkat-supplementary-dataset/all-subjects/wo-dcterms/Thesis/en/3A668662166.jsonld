            "abstract": "Nonparametric statistics are used in a wide field of research. This thesis is split up into two parts. A more theoretical consideration about bandwidth choice and two practical applications of a semiparametric approach for modeling multicategorical data. The first essay is concerned with optimal bandwidth choice in kernel density estimation. Since about three decades the discussion on bandwidth selection has been going on. On the one hand, bandwidth choice for empirical studies is provided by many software packages. On the other hand, up to now no overall optimal bandwidth selection method has been established. This thesis reviews existing methods and compare them on a set of designs concentrating thereby on small and moderate sample sizes. The main focus is on practical issues like fully automatic procedures, implementation and performance. The second and third essay consider a solution for modeling multicategorical data with the aid of non- and semiparametric methods. A smoothed likelihood estimator is proposed that allows for flexible functional forms and interactions between covariates. Classic multinomial logit models often seem to be not sufficient. In a more complex world the outcomes of these models simplify too much and partly contradict general beliefs. Contrary, the semiparametric approach of this thesis allows flexible modeling of the covariates and hence a more detailed analysis of the outcome ...",

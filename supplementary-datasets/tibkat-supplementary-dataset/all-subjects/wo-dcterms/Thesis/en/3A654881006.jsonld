            "abstract": "The landfilling of biodegradable waste is proven to contribute to environmental degradation. Much wood and lumber is discharged as waste from the cleared fields. These woody wastes are subsequently disposed of by burning. However, it would be preferable to dispose of them without combustion to avoid the release of carbon dioxide, one of the critical greenhouse gases. Instead of burning these woody wastes, we should recycle them as future resources. One solution to this problem is to make compost from the waste. Compost use in agriculture is increasing as both an alternative to landfilling for the management of biodegradable waste, as well as means of increasing or preserving soil organic matter. This research aimed to contribute to the identification of a system for managing the production and utilization of wood waste (Quercus rubra and Pinus sylvestris) compost for sustainable agriculture, with particular regards to carbon dioxide produced from both compost and combustion of wood.  Compost of wood was implemented in two consecutive trials. The first was carried out in greenhouse experiment in 4 liter pot of Quercus rubra and Pinus sylvestris (QR and PS) moisted by compost and tap water and infected by tiger worm (Eisenia fetida, EF) and European night crawlers (Dendrobaena veneta, DV) at different mixed ratios with lake mud (LM). The second was conducted in greenhouse experiment in 40 liter pot of the successful wood and worm from the first compost trial (QR and EF respectively). The tested wood (QR) was mixed separately by lake mud and horse manure and irrigated by compost and tap water.  The final product, successful wood compost (QR) produced from the first trial (4 liter pot) was utilized in different mixed ratios with coal mine tailings (tertiary sand) in greenhouse pot trial to study his effects on improving soil physical and chemical properties and some plant growth parameters of RSM 7.2.1 grass. The wood compost produced from the second compost experiment (40 liter pot) and other artificial component named Arkadolith\u00ae were used as soil amelioration in field experiments of different selected sites with extremely unsuitable characteristics (tertiary and quaternary sand in Lusatia lignite region, Germany). The soil in each site was sowed by RSM 7.2.1 and autochthonous grasses. Also, some vermicompost samples were selected to study its thermal stability which compared with a soil sample (Niedermoorgleys) by using thermogravimetric analysis technique. Further investigation was achieved to evaluate the effect of charcoal as a source of carbon on vermicompost stability. Moreover some selected vermicompost samples were used to examine its microstructure under scanning electron microscope which compared also with the same soil used in thermal analysis. The obtained results under all studied experiments can be arranged as follow: First compost trial, Cumulative amount of carbon dioxide produced during composting period was lower than that evolved by combustion of wood. The results showed composting of wood can reduce the emitted CO2 up to 50 % when compared with the amount of CO2 produced from combustion of wood. The effect of different studied factors on different studied parameters show that, QR wood compost have more responsive to decomposition processes and humification rate in comparison with PS wood compost. Under different infection worms, Eisenia fetida (EF) was better than Dendrobaena veneta (DV) in biodegradation rate. Compost water has had a better impact of tap water in all studied decomposition parameters. For example, The compost content of OM and total OC was decreased with the increase of the decomposition period in the treatments of compost water and EF worm, where this decrease was higher at mixed ratio of 1:3 (wood: mud, w/w). The total content of N in the final products takes reversible trend regarding to OM and C content. The high content of N was found in QR wood compost moisted by compost water and infected by EF worm. The content of both macro-and micro-nutrients was clearly positive affected by the studied factors. The content of these nutrients in QR wood compost was higher than that found in the compost of PS wood. Second compost trial, The observed data show that, the amount of CO2 produced by composting was lower than that evolved by combustion of wood. Composting of wood reduced CO2 emission up to 40 % of the combustion wood CO2. Cumulative amount of CO2 produced from wood compost treated by horse manure was higher than that fount in the other treated by LM. The compost of wood treated by horse manure has had a high decomposition rate in comparison with that treated by lake mud. The treatments left without worms during all composting period and moisted by compost water have a responsive effects but it was lower than that infected by worms. Total and available contents of N, P, K, Mg, Zn, and Cu in the compost treated by HM were higher than that found in compost treated by LM. The other nutrients (Ca, Fe, Cu, and Mn) take reversible trend, which it was higher in LM than HM treatments. Thermal and microstructure analysis,  The selected vermicompost samples from both first and second compost experiments showed, up to 200\u00b0 C temperature the mass loss was due to free water and bound water (It was in vermicompost samples higher than soil sample). Mass loss from 200 to 550\u00b0 C is due to easily oxidizable organic forms and it was higher in vermicompost than soil. In this stage the soil OM seems to be more stable than vermicompost which can be explained by a more intensive bond between the organic and inorganic components. At higher temperatures (T> 550\u00b0 C) no significant detectable was appeared of soil organic matter. In contrast, the vermicompost treatments showed a high proportion of stable groups, especially aromatic compounds. These statements seem to be importance particularly for the practical application of the wood compost in terms of their long-term effect in the soil. The application of charcoal, showed no additional stabilizing effect of vermicompost. Also, the data show that, vermicompost structure characterized with high homogeneity and ratio of surface area to volume compared to those in soil structure. First plant trials (greenhouse), Different compost mixed ratios had positive impact on different extreme soil physiochemical properties. At the end of experiment (42 days) compost increased soil water holding capacity, decreased soil bulk and particle density and increased total porosity. The used wood compost modified soil buffering capacity and soil acidity. The availability of soil macro and micro nutrients were increased after adding wood compost. The wood compost had a positive effect in some growth parameters like fresh and dry matter yield of the selected grass. High dry matter yield and nutrients uptake was achieved with higher rates of compost application (25.0% > 12.5% > 3.0% > 0.0 %, w/w).  Second plant trials (field experiment), Regarding to the effect of wood compost (QR) and Arkadolith\u00ae component on tertiary and quaternary sand, at the end of grown season (6 month) most soil and plant characteristics of tertiary sand were improved and it was better than that in quaternary sand. This trend reveals to, physical and chemical properties of tertiary sand was better than that in quaternary sand, like organic matter content, CEC, WHC, TOC, available nutrients. In the both sites, the effects of different type of soil conditioners arranged as follow: the treatments treated with wood compost is the better followed by the other treated with both wood compost and Arkadolith. Wood compost increased soil pH, CEC, soil buffering capacity, OM content, and soil WHC in comparison with Arkadolith which make a small improvement of these properties in both sites. Finally, Different growth parameters (height, covering, fresh and dry matter yield) of the used grasses were clearly positive affected by wood compost, with the highest production inherent to the treatments treated by the high amount of wood compost.",

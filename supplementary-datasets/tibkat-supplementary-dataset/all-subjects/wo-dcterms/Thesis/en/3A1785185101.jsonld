            "abstract": "The protein kinase uncoordinated protein 51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) is a key initiator of autophagy, a highly conserved degradation process in eukaryotic cells that is induced by various stress conditions, including viral infection. The general role of autophagy in the replication of viruses has not been clearly defined yet, because on the one hand it can act antiviral but on the other hand some viruses utilize this pathway to enhance their replication. Regarding human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, the role of autophagy has not been clearly elucidated so far. During autophagic processes, membrane material is acquired, and therefore it is conceivable that an enveloped virus, such as HCMV, exploits this pathway to facilitate its own replication. Utilizing a PCR array approach and siRNAs specifically targeting independent components of the autophagy machinery, we demonstrated that multiple autophagy-related genes are involved in HCMV replication and many of them appeared to have a proviral role. We found the steady state protein levels of key components of the ULK1 complex as well as the phosphorylation of ULK1 to be increased in fibroblasts following HCMV infection. In addition to that, ULK1 was also upregulated upon infection of epithelial cells. To analyze the function of ULK1 during HCMV infection in greater detail, we generated fibroblasts and epithelial cells featuring an shRNA-mediated knockdown of ULK1. In contrast to our results with an siRNA-mediated knockdown, we did not observe a negative effect of reduced ULK1 protein levels on viral replication in these cells although we demonstrated that the stable ULK1 knockdown in fibroblasts was functional regarding autophagy induction and sustenance. However, we observed that the inhibition of ULK1 kinase activity by the three chemically distinct compounds MRT68921, SBI-0206965 and ULK-101 interferes with HCMV replication. We characterized two of the compounds, MRT68921 and SBI-0206965, in more detail and confirmed their inhibitory potential in vitro and in cell ...",

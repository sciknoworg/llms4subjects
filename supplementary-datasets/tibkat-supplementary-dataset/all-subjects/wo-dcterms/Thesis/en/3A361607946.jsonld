                "Within the scope of this work, a versatile large linear magnetised plasma experiment was designed, constructed, and subsequently put into operation. The magnetised plasma was used to investigate the dispersion of whistler waves (circular polarised electromagnetic waves) with regard to the influence of the plasma boundaries. After a brief review over electromagnetic plasma waves and the three discharge modes of a helicon source, the experimental device and the diagnostic tools are explained in detail. Great attention is devoted to the identification of a reliable, calibrated magnetic fluctuation probe design. To the understanding of dynamical phenomena in ionospheric plasmas, whistler wave measurements in laboratory experiments may contribute significantly because of the ability to vary plasma parameters and to do measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the boundaries of laboratory experiments change the dispersion behaviour of whistler waves significantly if compared to the unbounded ionospheric situation. The influence of the plasma boundary is studied in the present work on three different levels of increasing complexity. First, a high density, small wavelength regime is established to make the effect of the boundary negligible ...",

            "abstract": "One of the primary outcomes of this thesis has been to develop an assessment model of the operational and organisational structure with regard to the AMOR approach (Alliances for the Mutual Organisation of Risk oriented inspection strategies). The AMOR model comprises the formation of an alliance between suppliers and customers in the supply chain for mutual benefit. Collaboration in the alliance is realised by jointly organising inspections which are performed in a risk oriented manner. To advance AMOR principles, it has been necessary to understand typical actors and their tasks in relation to intercompany quality and risk management. A fundamental contribution of this work has been an extensive investigation of the structures of pork producing chains to determine the key actors coordinating quality management strategies. Based on the results, a novel chain coordination model has been developed. With respect to risk management systems, this thesis has contributed an assessment of their fitness in relation to the key aspects of AMOR, including risk orientation\u02ba and collaboration with suppliers and/or cus-tomers\u02ba. It has been ascertained that more than half (55%) of the 119 surveyed companies of all industry sectors already use a risk management system to perform risk oriented in-spections. Furthermore, it has been established that collaboration on risk management takes place: 56 companies collaborate with suppliers, 47 with customers. The thesis expatiates on three forms of AMOR alliances and contributes a complete charac-terisation of the four principles underpinning the concept: (1) inspection design, (2) tasks and responsibilities, (3) information and communication structure, (4) costs/efforts and benefits to all parties. Regarding the three forms of alliance differentiation can be made between an alliance a) amongst one or more suppliers and one or more customers; b) complemented by a private sector third-party or c) by a public (or semi-public) sector third-party. Further results of empirical studies and interviews with industry professionals have discov-ered a strong willingness on the part of supply chain actors for AMOR inspections to become more widespread in industry as well as concrete examples of implementation. In consideration of the four aforementioned principles a scoring model has been proposed to determine the extent of AMOR adoption amongst companies of the agri-food supply chain. The model consists of 20 statements regarding the organisation of inspections within an alliance, which are assessed each on a scale from 0 to 5 points. In the model a maximum score of 100 can be achieved, implying implementation of the principles to their full extent. Based on the obtained score, five categories of AMOR adoption can be differentiated: AMOR professional, expert, beginner, uncoordinated, non-AMOR. Depending on the category, the proposed strategies for improvement of the respective operational and organisational struc-ture varies. The effectiveness of the proposed scoring scheme has been evaluated utilising four alliances. Two alliances have achieved a high degree of adoption (84 and 80 points), none of the cases have achieved the maximum score, offering ample room for improvement.",

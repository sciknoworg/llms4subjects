            "title": "Control of E-cadherin function in cell intercalation by ER glucosylation enzymes",
            "abstract": "Three consecutive glucosylations are the last steps in formation of the dolichol-PP-glycans before the glycans are transferred to nascent proteins in the ER. These three glucosyl residues are assumed to function in protein folding and ER quality control since they are consecutively cleaved to allow folding before the mono-glucosyl-glycan is recognized by the calreticulin/calnexin system. Finally, all glucoses are clipped off before ER exit. In my studies, the function of these glucosylation enzymes (Alg5/wol, Alg6/gny and Alg8/X-330) has been analyzed in the movement and morphogenesis of gastrulation and in Drosophila embryonic development. I have focused on their function in cell intercalation and found the expression of the integral membrane protein E-Cadherin strongly reduced and partially glycosylated in the mutants. Consistently, reduced expression of E-cadherin induced by RNAi leads to a comparable phenotype, which indicates that E-cadherin is a relevant down stream target of the X-330 mutant for the cell intercalation defect ...",

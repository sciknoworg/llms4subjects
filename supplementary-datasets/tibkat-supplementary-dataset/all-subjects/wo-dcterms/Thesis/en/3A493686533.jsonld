            "abstract": "Many real world problems can be mapped onto graphs and solved with well-established efficient algorithms studied in graph theory. One such problem is to find large sets of points satisfying some mutual relationship. This problem can be transformed to the problem of finding all cliques of an undirected graph by mapping each point onto a vertex of the graph and connecting any two vertices by an edge whose corresponding points satisfy our desired relationship. Clique detection has been widely studied and there exist efficient algorithms. In this paper we study a related problem, where all points have a set of binary attributes, each of which is either 0 or 1. This is only a small limitation, since all discrete properties can be mapped onto binary attributes. In our case, we want to find large sets of points not only satisfying some mutual relationship; but, in addition, all points of a set also need to have at least one common attribute with value 1 ...",

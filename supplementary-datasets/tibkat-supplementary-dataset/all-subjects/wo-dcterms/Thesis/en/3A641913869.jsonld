            "abstract": "Piezoelectric materials are very useful for applications in sensors and actuators. In addition to traditional ferroelectric ceramics and ferroelectric polymers, ferroelectrets have recently become a new group of piezoelectrics. Ferroelectrets are functional polymer systems for electromechanical transduction, with elastically heterogeneous cellular structures and internal quasi-permanent dipole moments. The piezoelectricity of ferroelectrets stems from linear changes of the dipole moments in response to external mechanical or electrical stress. Over the past two decades, polypropylene (PP) foams have been investigated with the aim of ferroelectret applications, and some products are already on the market. PP-foam ferroelectrets may exhibit piezoelectric d33 coefficients of 600 pC/N and more. Their operating temperature can, however, not be much higher than 60 \u00b0C. Recently developed polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) and cyclo-olefin copolymer (COC) foam ferroelectrets show slightly better d33 thermal stabilities, but usually at the price of smaller d33 values. Therefore, the main aim of this work is the development of new thermally stable ferroelectrets with appreciable piezoelectricity. Physical foaming is a promising technique for generating polymer foams from solid films without any pollution or impurity. Supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) or nitrogen (N2) are usually employed as foaming agents due to their good solubility in several polymers. Polyethylene propylene (PEN) is a polyester with slightly better properties than PET. A \u201cvoiding + inflation + stretching\u201d process has been specifically developed to prepare PEN foams. Solid PEN films are saturated with supercritical CO2 at high pressure and then thermally voided at high temperatures. Controlled inflation (Gas-Diffusion Expansion or GDE) is applied in order to adjust the void dimensions. Additional biaxial stretching decreases the void heights, since it is known lens-shaped voids lead to lower elastic moduli and therefore also to stronger piezoelectricity. Both, contact and corona charging are suitable for the electric charging of PEN foams. The light emission from the dielectric-barrier discharges (DBDs) can be clearly observed. Corona charging in a gas of high dielectric strength such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) results in higher gas-breakdown strength in the voids and therefore increases the piezoelectricity. PEN foams can exhibit piezoelectric d33 coefficients as high as 500 pC/N. Dielectric-resonance spectra show elastic moduli c33 of 1 \u2212 12 MPa, anti-resonance frequencies of 0.2 \u2212 0.8 MHz, and electromechanical coupling factors of 0.016 \u2212 0.069. As expected, it is found that PEN foams show better thermal stability than PP and PET. Samples charged at room temperature can be utilized up to 80 \u2212 100 \u00b0C. Annealing after charging or charging at elevated temperatures may improve thermal stabilities. Samples charged at suitable elevated temperatures show working temperatures as high as 110 \u2212 120 \u00b0C. Acoustic measurements at frequencies of 2 Hz \u2212 20 kHz show that PEN foams can be well applied in this frequency range. Fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) copolymers are fluoropolymers with very good physical, chemical and electrical properties. The charge-storage ability of solid FEP films can be significantly improved by adding boron nitride (BN) filler particles. FEP foams are prepared by means of a one-step procedure consisting of CO2 saturation and subsequent in-situ high-temperature voiding. Piezoelectric d33 coefficients up to 40 pC/N are measured on such FEP foams. Mechanical fatigue tests show that the as-prepared PEN and FEP foams are mechanically stable for long periods of time. Although polymer-foam ferroelectrets have a high application potential, their piezoelectric properties strongly depend on the cellular morphology, i.e. on size, shape, and distribution of the voids. On the other hand, controlled preparation of optimized cellular structures is still a technical challenge. Consequently, new ferroelectrets based on polymer-layer system (sandwiches) have been prepared from FEP. By sandwiching an FEP mesh between two solid FEP films and fusing the polymer system with a laser beam, a well-designed uniform macroscopic cellular structure can be formed. Dielectric resonance spectroscopy reveals piezoelectric d33 coefficients as high as 350 pC/N, elastic moduli of about 0.3 MPa, anti-resonance frequencies of about 30 kHz, and electromechanical coupling factors of about 0.05. Samples charged at elevated temperatures show better thermal stabilities than those charged at room temperature, and the higher the charging temperature, the better is the stability. After proper charging at 140 \u00b0C, the working temperatures can be as high as 110 \u2212 120 \u00b0C. Acoustic measurements at frequencies of 200 Hz \u2212 20 kHz indicate that the FEP layer systems are suitable for applications at least in this range.",

            "abstract": "In mountainous watersheds snow melt can have a significant impact on the water balance and at certain times of the year it could be the most important contribution to runoff. In many parts of the world snow act as natural reservoirs that can play an important role for water supply. Alas, despite its importance, many of snow driven basins suffer from a lack of hydrological infrastructure and equipment so they cannot be described adequately in terms of snow hydrological dynamics. Because of limited accessibility are the few observation stations in such areas very rarely located in the higher elevations but are concentrated mostly in the middle and low elevation resulting in an underrepresentation in data availability of the high altitudes which are important for the process dynamics. Thus the modelling of snow hydrological dynamics in mountainous regions such as the Latyan catchment is often difficult. Reasons for this are in addition to the aforementioned data availability, topographic effects and gradients that can make a spatial interpolation of the input data and the model states a complicated task. Especially in semi-arid regions, high-altitude headwater basins with a significant snow component have a large potential by balancing and distributing scarce water resources.",

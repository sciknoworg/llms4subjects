            "abstract": "This thesis is about the development of biased ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We focused specifically on the intensively investigated \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and the 5-HT1A receptor. The serotonergic compounds were designed in a ligand-based approach, taking 6-(3-((2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl)amino)propoxy)-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one, ST171, as lead structure. In order to identify structural features which might be responsible for receptor binding and activation a series of ST171 analogues was synthesized. Therefore, modifications were implemented to cover the three structural motifs linker-length, benzoxazinone substituent and 2-methoxyphenoxy head group. Biological investigations showed that the modification of the head group could positively affect the binding affinity and selectivity as well as the 5-HT1A receptor activation. Within this series, TA132, comprising the heteroaromatic 4-indolyl head group, was identified as high affinity 5-HT1A receptor ligand (0.12 nM) with an improved selectivity profile compared to ST171. Moreover, ongoing functional studies indicate that TA132 behaves as a potent partial agonist (EC50 0.36 nM) with bias over \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. The purpose of the second part of this thesis was the development of \u03b2-adrenergic ligands showing an alternate signaling profile compared to classical agonists or antagonists. The hybrid ligands ST74 and ST77 were chosen as lead structures since the hybridization of an agonist-like catechol head group and an antagonist-like oxypropanolamine linker conferred G protein bias. Instead of the catechol head group the hybrid ligands within this series bear a less labile 5-hydroxy-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one scaffold and differ in their nitrogen appendage (alkyl, arylalkyl, aryloxyalkyl). Biological investigations identified TA119, bearing an arylalkyl nitrogen substituent, as a high affinity ligand at the \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenergic receptor whose functional behavior points towards a G protein-preferring signaling profile. ; Diese ...",

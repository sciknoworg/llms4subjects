            "abstract": "The handling of mobile nodes in the Internet has always been challenging since the Internet Protocol (IP) by design assumes that a network interface has an identifier that stays fixed at least for the duration of a data transfer. With the recent proliferation of mobile devices that provide advanced computing capabilities and resources such as netbooks, smartphones, or Internet tablets common mobile usage of the Internet is rising constantly. Moreover, applications that where not developed with mobile devices in mind and services that generally do not do well with mobility (e.g. voice-over-IP or live streaming) can be run commonly on these devices. Providing scalable and deployable mobility support in heterogeneous IP based wireless access networks that such devices are used in remains an issue. The more traditional approaches such as Mobile IP and Proxy Mobile IP provide centralized anchors that redirect the traffic destined for the mobile node to its current point of attachment. While especially Proxy Mobile IP sees large deployments in cellular networks its centralized approach provides deployment and scalability barriers and is not well suited for distributed and fragmented environments such as hot-spots. This thesis proposes a network based decentralized mobility management framework which can provide mobility support without the collaboration of mobile nodes and without relying on centralized elements ...",

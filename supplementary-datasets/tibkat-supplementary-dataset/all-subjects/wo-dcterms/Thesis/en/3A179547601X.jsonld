            "abstract": "The universal and simple approach for region-selective deposition of variable metal oxide core-shell nanomaterials (NMs) as a layer-by-layer assembly is demonstrated within this research work. The aluminium oxide (AlOx) nanoparticles (NPs), iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) NPs, titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs and nanorods (NRs) are functionalized by 6-phosphonohexanoic acid (PHA) and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) molecules resulting into metal oxide inorganic-organic core-shell NMs. Additionally, the substrate is pre-patterned with self-assembled monolayer (SAM) based on AMPA and semi-fluorinated phosphonic acid (PA) molecules representing the primary amine (R-NH2) and non-polar semi-fluorinated terminated groups respectively. As a result, the deposition of functional core-shell NMs is alternatively performed with controlled multilayer thickness, precise region-selectivity and full order control of each layer on pre-patterned substrate surface. The stacking of NMs layer-by-layer between themselves on pre-patterned AMPA SAM substrate surface is performed with resulted secondary amide binding (SAB) from covalently reacted -NH2 and -COOH terminated groups available on substrate (R-NH2) and functionalized NMs (R-COOH and R-NH2) respectively. In order to form SAB, the chemical reaction is supported by amide coupling agents. Afterwards, the semi-fluorinated PA is used to prevent the undesired adsorption of NMs on substrate after deposition on AMPA SAM. As a result, the defined pattern of NMs is created in \u03bcm scale. The controlled deposition of functional AlOx NPs as a 1st core-shell layer is successfully expanded into three-dimensional nanostructure. This nanostructure is composed of multiple-assembling of functional TiO2 NRs and alternatively Fe2O3 NPs as a 2nd core-shell layer. The functional TiO2 NPs as a 3rd core-shell layer are applied. The termination of nanostructural fabrication is achieved by functionalization of latter deposited core-shell TiO2 NPs by 1-aminopyrene molecules resulting into inorganic-organic hybrid ...",

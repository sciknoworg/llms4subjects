                "The leading hypothesis of why organisms age is the \"Free Radical Theory of Aging\", which states that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O2o-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), causes protein, lipid and DNA damage and leads to the observed age-related decline of cells and tissues. A major obstacle in analyzing the role of oxidative stress in aging organisms is the inability to precisely localize and quantify the oxidants, to identify proteins and pathways that might be affected, and ultimately, to correlate changes in oxidant levels with the lifespan of the organism. To directly monitor the onset and extent of oxidative stress during the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, we utilized the fluorescent H2O2 sensor protein HyPer, which enabled us to quantify endogenous peroxide levels in different tissues of living animals in real time. We made the surprising observation that wildtype C. elegans is exposed to very high peroxide levels during development. Peroxide levels drop rapidly as the animals mature, and low peroxide levels then prevail throughout the reproductive age, after which an age-accompanying increase of peroxide level is observed. These results were in excellent agreement with findings obtained by using the highly quantitative redox proteomic technique OxICAT, which monitors the oxidation status of redox-sensitive proteins as read-out for onset, localization, and protein targets of oxidative stress. By using OxICAT, we detected increased protein ..."

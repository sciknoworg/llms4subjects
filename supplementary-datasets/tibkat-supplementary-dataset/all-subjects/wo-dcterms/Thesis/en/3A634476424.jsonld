            "abstract": "Cape hakes, Merluccius capensis, Merluccius paradoxus, Benguela system, upwelling, early life strategy. - Recruitment is a key process in the sustainability of marine fish populations. The dynamic and complex process of recruitment is integrated over several life stages, with many different factors affecting each stage leading to high variability in populations. This study aimed at gaining important knowledge on the early life history and the factors affecting recruitment of the two demersal Cape hake species Merluccius paradoxus and M. capensis in the southern Benguela upwelling system off South Africa. Eggs and larvae were collected by stratified hauls during four cruises in two consecutive years. Early juveniles were collected on one cruise in the northern part of the study area off the Orange River. The spatial distribution patterns, growth and condition of early stages were investigated using a combination of classic and novel methods. Spatial distribution patterns were described by species-specific vertical and horizontal abundances. Growth was investigated by otolith analyses of larvae and juveniles. Larval conditions were analysed by measuring RNA:DNA ratios. Another method for estimating condition was applied to eggs and larvae by measuring the total lipid content. Fatty acid compositions were investigated in order to reveal the levels of essential fatty acids, needed for growth and development. Stomach content analyses complemented the information on early life stages as they elucidated the feeding of larvae in the study area. Distribution patterns revealed that M. paradoxus was the dominant species during the study periods, indicating a temporal and possibly spatial separation of spawning of the two Cape hake species. This difference in the spawning strategy reduces competition ...",

            "abstract": "Symbiosis, gutless, autotrophy, carbon fixation, sulfur oxidation, MARFISH, nanoSIMS. - Marin gutless oligochaete worms (Annelida, Phallodrilinae) live in an obligate association with bacterial endosymbionts. Each host, belonging to one of the two genera Olavius or Inanidrilus, harbours a specific, but morphologically, phylogenetically and metabolically diverse symbiont community. The primary symbionts of gutless oligochaetes, called Gamma 1, are large chemoautotrophic sulfur-storing bacteria that form a monophyletic clade within the Gammaproteobacteria and had been found in all host species studied so far. Secondary symbionts of gutless oligochaetes belong to the Alpha-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria and to the Spirochaetes. In this PhD thesis the diversity and function of gutless oligochaete symbiont communities was investigated.In a first part, the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of I. exumae was studied. The symbiont community of this host differed markedly from that of other gutless oligochaetes. Sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterial symbionts co-occurred with alpha-proteobacterial symbionts in this host, showing that these do not mutually exclude each other as previously assumed. Furthermore, a large novel gammaproteobacterial symbiont only distantly related to the Gamma 1 symbionts, but morphologically similar, dominated the symbiont community, while no indication was found for a Gamma 1 symbiont. The presence of sulfur and genes diagnostic for autotrophy and sulfur oxidation indicate that this new symbiont is a sulfur-storing chemoautotroph. Thus, the novel symbiont seems to share its morphology and its function with the Gamma 1 symbionts and may have replaced the Gamma 1 symbiont in I. exumae.To learn more about the ecophysiology of gutless oligochaete symbioses, the autotrophic activity was investigated in a second project with tracer incubation experiments. Analyses of radiolabelled inorganic carbon uptake and sulfur content of individual Olavius algarvensis worms showed that in the presence of oxygen, internally stored sulfur was used as an energy source for the incorporation of inorganic carbon into biomass. In the absence of oxygen, inorganic carbon was taken up at lower rates. The electron donors and electron acceptors used under anoxic conditions could not be unambiguously identified. However, increased carbon fixation occurred in the presence of nitrate, ...",

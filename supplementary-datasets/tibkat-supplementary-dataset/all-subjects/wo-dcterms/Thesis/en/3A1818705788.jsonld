            "abstract": "Self-regulation plays a fundamental role in academic achievement in that it helps students to modify their emotions, behavior, and cognition to meet the demands of learning activities. The central objective of this dissertation was to examine the developmental relationship between self-regulation and academic achievement during childhood. The dissertation combines the results of three related papers to answer this broad objective. Before investigating the developmental interplay between the different aspects of self-regulation and academic achievement, first, the question of whether self-regulation is a unitary or a multidimensional construct was addressed. The result of the first paper supports a multidimensional self-regulation where emotional and behavioral regulation are related but developmentally separate constructs. In addition to their developmental distinctiveness, emotional and behavioral regulation showed a reciprocal relationship from ages three to five and five to seven. The three main components of self-regulation\u2014emotional regulation, behavioral regulation, and metacognition\u2014are assumed to have unique mechanisms to positively influence academic achievement. The result of the cross-lagged panel analysis in the first paper demonstrates that behavioral regulation at the age of seven is a strong predictor of academic achievement at the age of 11, even after taking socioeconomic status into account. The other two papers focused on the developmental relationship between metacognition and academic achievement. The result of the multivariate latent growth curve analysis, in the second paper, reveals that intra-developmental changes in declarative metacognition and reading comprehension are positively and significantly related from grades 5 to 8, even after taking verbal cognitive ability into account. The third paper examined the developmental interplay between metacognitive monitoring and reading comprehension from grades 5 to 9, and a reciprocal relationship is observed.",

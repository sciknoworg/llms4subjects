            "title": "Doping efficiency and limits in wurtzite (Mg,Zn)O alloys",
            "abstract": "In this thesis, the structural, optical, and electrical properties of wurtzite MgxZn1-xO:Al and MgxZn1-xO:Ga thin films have been investigated in dependence on Mg and dopant concentration. Among the transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), ZnO based compounds have gained renewed interest as a transparent electrode for large scale applications such as defroster windows, at panel displays, touch screens, and thin film solar cells due to low material and processing cost, non-toxicity, and suitable physical properties. In general, these applications require transparent electrodes with lowest possible resistivity of rho &lt; 10^-3 Ohmcm and lower [1]. Recently, it has been reported that Ga and Al doped ZnO thin films can be deposited with respective resistivity of 5x10^-5 Ohmcm [2] and 3 x10^-5 Ohmcm [3] which are similar to the data obtained for other practical TCOs, i.e. the resistivity of about 4x 10^-5 Ohmcm for Sn doped In2O3 (ITO) thin films [4]. Moreover, the bandgap of ZnO can be increased by alloying with Mg offering band alignment between transparent electrode and active (or buffer) layer of the device, e.g. Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells [5]. The tunable bandgap of these transparent electrodes can further increase the efficiency of the devices by avoiding energy losses in the interface region of the layers. From this point of view, this work has been aimed to investigate the doping efficiency and limits in transparent conductive (Mg,Zn)O alloys. For this purpose, the samples investigated in this work have been grown by pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) using a novel, continuous composition spread method (CCS). In general, this method allows to grow thin films with lateral composition gradient(s) [6, 7]. All MgxZn1-xO:Al and MgxZn1-xO:Ga thin films have been deposited on 2-inch in diameter glass, c- or r-plane sapphire substrates using threefold segmented PLD targets in order to grow thin films with two perpendicular, lateral composition gradients, i.e. the Mg composition is varied in one direction whereas the Al/Ga concentration is varied in a perpendicular direction [7, 8]. In order to investigate the influence of the temperature, samples grown at different substrate temperatures in the range of 25 to 600 C were investigated. The optical and electrical measurements have been carried out on (5x 5)mm^2 samples that were cut from the CCS wafers along the respective composition gradients, i.e. Mg and Al/Ga contents. Subsequently, physical properties of thin films have been analyzed for a large range of Al/Ga content between 0.5 and 7 at.%, which corresponds to doping concentrations between 2x 10^20 and 3x 10^21 cm^-3, for different Mg contents x(Mg) ranging from 0.01 to 0.1. It has been found that practically the limiting the dopant concentrations is about 2 x10^21 cm^-3. Further, the electrical data suggests, that the compensating intrinsic defect is doubly chargeable hinting to the zinc vacancy (V_Zn) as microscopic origin. Increasing the dopant concentration above 2 x10^21 cm^-3 leads to a degradation of electrical and structural properties [8]. Further, the influence of growth and annealing temperatures on structural, electrical and optical properties of the films has been studied. For that purpose, Al and Ga doped (2.5 at.% = 1x10^21 cm^-3) Mg0.05Zn0.95O thin films have been chosen from CCS samples grown at T_g = (25 - 600) C . For both doping series, the samples grown at higher temperatures exhibit better crystalline quality compared to the samples grown at lower growth temperatures. As a result, samples grown at higher temperatures reveal higher Hall mobility. For the Al-doping series, the highest free charge carrier density of n = 8.2x 10^20 cm^-3 was obtained for an Mg0.05Zn0.95O:Al thin film grown at 200 C, with corresponding Hall mobility of mu = 13.3 cm^2/Vs, a resistivity of rho = 5.7x10^-4 Ohmcm, and optical bandgap of E_g = 3.8 eV. Interestingly, the free charge carrier density of n = (5 - 8) x 10^20 cm^-3 for samples grown with T_g &gt; 300 C is clearly higher than the value of n = 1.25 x 10^20 cm^-3 that was obtained for the high temperature grown sample, i.e. at T_g = 600 C. Furthermore, for all T_g, Al-doped films have a higher doping efficiency than the Ga-doped counterparts. In order to look deeper into the microscopic origin of this behavior, the samples were post-annealed in vacuum at 400 C. Experimental results showed that the free charge carrier density of Al-doped samples first decreased and saturated afterward with increasing annealing time. On the other hand, the free charge carrier density of the Ga-doped samples first slightly increased and saturated with increasing annealing time. For both doping series, the saturation value of n ~ 1 x 10^20 cm^-3 was very close to the data that has been observed for (i) high temperature grown samples and (ii) the solubility limit of Al in ZnO of 0.3 at.% = 1.2x 10^20 cm^-3, that has been determined by Shirouzu et al. for high temperature grown (T_g &gt; 600 C) Al-doped ZnO [9]. Correspondingly, the optical bandgap also changed, i.e. increased (decreased) for Al- (Ga-) doping series, and approached a constant value of 3.5 0 +- 0.1 eV which is explained by generation of acceptor-like compensating defects, and the solubility limit of the dopants. From XRD data, no secondary phases were found for as-grown and post-annealed films. However, the slight improvement of crystalline quality has been observed on post-annealed samples. Further, it has been shown that the growth and annealing temperatures are important as they strongly affect the metastable state of the solid solution that samples grown at low temperature represent. The low solubility limit of the dopants, i.e. 0.3 at.% for Al in ZnO under equilibrium condition, can be increased by preparing samples by non-equilibrium growth techniques [10]. This is also consistent with experimental results of this work that Al- as well as Ga-doped metastable ZnO and (Mg,Zn)O thin films can be prepared with highest possible doping efficiency for the dopant concentration up to 2.5 at.% when growth or annealing temperatures below 400 C are used.",

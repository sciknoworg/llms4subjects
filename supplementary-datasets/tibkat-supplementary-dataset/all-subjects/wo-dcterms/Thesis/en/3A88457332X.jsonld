            "title": "The spatial concept at Moslem settlements in current context of modern Indonesia using phenomenology method : case study: Pathok Negoro Area in Yogyakarta, Indonesia",
            "abstract": "Settlement is human place to live and do various activities (Finch, 1980). Concept of settlement layout is closely associated with human and a set of thoughts and behaviors. In this case, idea of pattern of activities in a society that is core of a culture becomes main factor in process of formation of houses and environment in a settlement. Factors which affecting form (physical) of architecture in a settlement environment are socio-cultural, economic, and religious determinant factor that manifested architectural realization (Rapoport, 1969). Yogyakarta as the continuation of kingdom city in the Java Island finally exists as an Islamic kingdom that still remain to survive up to now. Impacts of this issue is appearance of various Moslem settlements to support typical character of an Islamic Kingdom. Mlangi is an area of oldest Moslem settlements in Yogyakarta has not been explored in details for progress especially in physical glasses recently. Everything basic group and individual who arrange houses and residences, starts from how it has spatial concept alone. Although concept is a very abstract thing to explain in details, but its existence can be detected by how they created their physical environment. This research conducted by these research questions: (1) What are spatial concepts owned by people in Mlangi and (2) How do spatial concepts owned by the people affect the settlements pattern? Process to search spatial concept owned by the people in Moslem residence, making Mlangi as study area, was approached by using phenomenological research method. The researcher have to self-involved directly in unstructured interviews, but remained in guideline framework of in interviews to make research process effective. Fistly, the researcher interviewed the key person, they are the head of Mlangi administration (pak Dukuh) in Mlangi and Sawahan. They were then give advices to who was capable person that could draw the spatial concept and had many story and knew the history of the settlements. Step by step of interview guided from one informant to next informant when the information had been told repeatedly. The next informant based on the last informant advice or who had close relationship with the last theme appeared. To complete the narration and draw the result of interview, researcher have to add additional information with photograph and descriptive picture that can be draw the settlement empirically. In process, 17 information units which found in field were consistent with sequence of interview events and flowing of theme to theme associated with Moslem residence of residence. Finally the interviews succeeded in abstracting 16 themes that may be classified into historic, socio-cultural, and spatial-concept dimensions in Mlangi. Process of analysis to find spatial concept owned by the people in Moslem settlements was carried out by dialogue of themes to find available substantive relationship. Four concepts successfully analyzed consist of concepts of personage, concept of religious implementation, concept of Jero-Jaba and concept of Interest. The four concepts are really associated with one and others in understanding how spatial concept owned by the people affects residence they occupy. Yet, concept of Jero-Jaba bases all concepts of people in Mlangi . This concept can be used to draw red yarn on how they utilize communal spaces in residence and layout rooms of their individual houses. This concept also eternalize residence patterns existing in Mlangi now where residence does not experience many changes from starting of this residence existence (from detection of generation currently still living), namely residence patterns concentrate on orientation to Masjid Pathok Negoro of Mlangi. This research was opening the potential research area, at least for the sociology, anthropology and demography research interest. So many unique character in Mlangi if looked at from how they maintain their spatial concept and manifested in their daily activities. How the people will concern only for the religious activities and the economic concern only for survival aspect in live.

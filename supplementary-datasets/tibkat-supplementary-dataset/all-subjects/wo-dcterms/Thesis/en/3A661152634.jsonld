As females with CLBP show higher psychological and pain-related impairments than males, it may be assumed that women in orthopaedic inpatient rehabilitation of CLBP are more prone to develop chronic pain. Overall, the development of individualised multimodal intervention programmes is indicated. Thereby, patients at high-risk to develop chronic pain need to be identified and subsequently allocated to specific psychological interventions. Purpose of the presented work was to determine gender-specific differences and further psychosocial factors in inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation of CLBP. Moreover, long-term effects of a specific psychological intervention for patients with CLBP and co-existing depressive symptoms were investigated in comparison to the solely standard rehabilitation. Objectives and Results: First, the criterion validity of the Mainz Pain Staging System (MPSS; Gerbershagen, 1996) was examined among patients with CLBP in orthopaedic inpatient rehabilitation, considering the four axes of the MPSS separately. For each axis, psychosocial variables were analysed depending on the stage of axis (I, II, III). Results showed that an increasing stage of axis was associated with more severe impairments in pain-related and psychological variables for all axes (manuscript I). Furthermore, in realising a one-factorial design, psychosocial variables were investigated depending on gender among patients with CLBP in orthopaedic inpatient rehabilitation. Women showed significantly more severe impairments in psychological variables and functional capacity immediately after rehabilitation. Moreover, the development of chronic pain was more advanced in females than males (manuscript II). Finally, by conducting a three-factorial design, short-, mid-, and long-term effects of a cognitive-behavioural training ...",

            "abstract": "This habilitation thesis summarizes the results of 10 scientific publications (references: paper1-10) addressing the topic Emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in and beyond companion animal medicine\". The first chapter's intention is to introduce my research area to the reader by providing basic information on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria, including general resistance mechanisms, distribution and spread in different ecological environments and the commonly applied clinical classifications relevant for the veterinary medicine field. The following section characterizes the nature of health care associated infections (HAIs) in human and veterinary medicine, including baseline similarities and differences. Subsequently, bacterial pathogens exhibiting particular antibiotic resistances are introduced. Here, a strong focus is set on AMR bacteria frequently associated with HAIs in human and veterinary medicine, which are therefore also considered as \"indicator pathogens\". Since \u03b2-lactams such as penicillins and cephalosporins are known for their excellent pharmacokinetic properties which is commonly accompanied by a low toxicity for mammals, this group of active substances is of particular importance for antimicrobial treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in both humans and animals. Infections with indicator pathogens harboring resistance towards \u03b2-lactams such as Staphylococcus aureus [methicillin resistant S. aureus, (MRSA)] and Escherichia coli [Extended-Spectrum \u03b2-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli)] are therefore often accompanied by treatment failure. Since antibiotics belonging to this group are among the \"first choices\" for empirical treatment of infectious diseases, including life-threatening scenarios such as septicemia, collaborative efforts to limit spread of \u03b2-lactam resistance are currently an important goal in human- and veterinary medicine. Additional resistances towards further classes of antibiotic substances are frequently associated with ...\"",

            "abstract": "Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is a renowned crop worldwide for its edible oil as well as a source of protein animal feed. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has proved to work efficient for genetic engineering of this crop. The majority of successful transformation systems hitherto described for B. napus use diploid plant materials such as hypocotyls, cotyledons, and cotyledonary petioles. When diploid plant materials were used, first generation transgenic plants (T1) would be hemizygous for the transformed gene(s). Consequently, much time and labour has to be invested to produce homozygous transgenic plants by repeated selfing or by applying the doubled haploid technology. The use of haploid cells and tissue explants could provide an alternative approach for efficient transformation of oilseed rape, since haploid transgenic plants will become homozygous in one step after colchicine treatment. This study reports the potential of using leaf and petiole explants of haploid plants propagated in vitro for an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. Compared to a standard protocol for hypocotyl segments, significantly higher callus production (P=0.05) with leaf explants was achieved when cultured in callus induction medium CIM-L (MS basal medium supplemented with 1 mg/l BAP, 0.1 mg/l NAA, 0.1 mg/l GA3, 5 mg/l AgNO3 and solidified with 5 g/l Agarose). For petiole explants CIM-P medium (MS basal supplemented with 2 mg/l BAP, 0.01 mg/l picloram, 5 mg/l AgNO3 and solidified with 5 g/l Agarose) had a significant positive effect (P=0.05) on callus production. Highest shoot regeneration was achieved in DKW medium supplemented with 1 mg/l BAP, 0.1 mg/l NAA, 0.1 mg/l GA3, and 5 mg/l AgNO3 and solidified with 5 g/l Agarose. Analysis of the ploidy showed that 96% of plantlets regenerated from leaf and 92% from petiole explants remained haploid ...",

            "abstract": "Wayfinding, which is the task of getting from some origin to a destination, is one of the primary spatial problems humans encounter in everyday life. When we wayfind, we act in the environment based on the structure and features of the environment, set against a background of knowledge which is generally understood as having visual characteristics. As mobile and wireless technologies proliferate in urban space it can be considered as having an existence in terms of several spaces, those of places that make up our direct perceptual experience and those of the digital devices and networks that facilitate communication, which are primarily non-visual in nature. This thesis will extend existing work on perception and action in urban space to investigate the role of mobile and ubiquitous technologies in wayfinding and environmental legibility, or more literally how we orientate and find our way in space when we experience it both with and through technology. ...",

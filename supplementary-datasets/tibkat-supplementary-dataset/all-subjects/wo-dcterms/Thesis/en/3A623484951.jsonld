            "abstract": "Intuition, intuitive action, unconscious action, outpatient care, grounded-theory methodology, action model, routine, linguistic coding, anticipation, interview, participatory observation, video documentation. - The research work examines the originating contexts, components and features of intuitive nursing action in outpatient care. In the theoretical section of the work, the basic content of nursing action within the realm of nursing science and in the care sector of outpatient care is set out. Following on from this, there follows a description of the research subject, intuition. Here, the theoretical and research-based existing knowledge on the phenomenon of intuition is incorporated from the key reference disciplines of nursing science and the discipline of nursing. The empirical examination aimed at recording the phenomenon of intuition in outpatient care rests on the foundations of qualitative social research. The epistemological basis is symbolic interactionism. In order to uncover an empirically-founded theory, the grounded-theory methodology was used. The methods of data gathering formed a triangulation of participatory observation with video documentation, and guided interviews with video analysis. As a result, two modes of nursing action were identified as components of an action model, in the form of a slide presentation of intuitive action. The action model comprises a conceptual, case-related design by caregivers for their actions in relation to care recipients. It reflects the normality of action, and functions as an orientation framework for nursing actions. Intuition as a situation-linked trigger for action leads on the one hand to routine actions which correspond to the model and contribute towards its consolidation. On the other hand, intuition triggers actions which deviate from the model of the caregiver and contribute to its expansion. The intuitive actions are presented in the form of manual (e.g. as routine), linguistic (e.g. as coding) and materialized actions (e.g. physical touching). Intuition in outpatient care constitutes individualized, situation-linked knowledge of action oriented towards everyday professional work, which is based in particular on empirical knowledge and cognitive abilities. The intuitive actions may be understood as a skill of caregivers for the purpose of structuring their complex everyday professional work. Intuition - understood as a skill - also means that",

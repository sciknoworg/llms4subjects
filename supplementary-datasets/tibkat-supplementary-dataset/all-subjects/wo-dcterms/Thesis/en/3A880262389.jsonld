            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: The present work is based on studies that were performed from 01.04.2009 until 31.05.2012 in the Insitute for Geoscience at the Albert-Ludwigs University in Freiburg. The goal of this research was to investigate a rock formation, which is exposed at \u201cTrockener Steg\u201c, near Zermatt, in the Western Alps. This rock association is referred to as the \u201cupper Theodul glacier unit\u201c. During fieldwork it was observed that the upper Theodul glacier unit is in many respects different from the known ophiolitic rocks in the area around Zermatt. In contrast to the upper Theodul glacier unit, the ophiolites of the Zermatt-Saas region have been studied extensively. The motivation for this work was to investigate the origin of  \u201cTrockener Steg\u201c rocks, which has not been studied to date. Furthermore, the aim of this work is to place these rocks into an overall context within the surrounding Zermatt-Saas ophiolites. This work is divided into three manuscripts representing each an independent section",

            "abstract": "In this thesis a volume-limited sample (D \u2264 1 kpc) of 316 B-type stars was investigated regarding their multiplicity status and the distribution of fundamental parameter such as their separation or mass-ratio distributions to improve our understanding of the formation processes of stellar and multiple systems. For this purpose public archival data of B-type stars in combination with own observations were analysed, obtained by diffraction-limited near-infrared imaging with NAOSCONICA at the Very Large Telescope located at the Paranal observation site in Chile. For each of the selected target stars the presence of visual companions was investigated and their physical association confirmed or rejected either by analysing their common proper motion. The projected separation range covered by this sample extends from 20 to about 7000 au. Among the 316 B-type stars a total of 194 sources were resolved in the vicinity of 148 primaries, including 9 new confirmed detections, 19 previously known but first-time confirmed detections and 38 new resolved candidate companions, respectively. Similar to the solar-type binary distribution the measured separation distribution forms a log-normal distribution, but with a peak shifted towards a significantly wider separation of 214+38\u221224 au. The estimated mass ratio distribution follows a power-law f (q) \u221d q, with \u0393 \u2248 \u22120.50. Furthermore, there is evidence for a dependency of the mass ratio distribution on the binary separation, which tends towards smaller mass ratios for wider binaries. The measured companion star fraction of the sample, uncorrected for biases, is 51.3+2.8\u22122.8",

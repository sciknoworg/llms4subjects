            "abstract": "The continuously increasing pollution of aquatic environments with microplastics (plastic particles < 5 mm) is a global problem with potential implications for organisms of all trophic levels. For microorganisms, trillions of these floating microplastics particles represent a huge surface area for colonization. Due to the very low biodegradability, microplastics remain years to centuries in the environment and can be transported over thousands of kilometers together with the attached organisms. Since also pathogenic, invasive, or otherwise harmful species could be spread this way, it is essential to study microplastics-associated communities. For this doctoral thesis, eukaryotic communities were analyzed for the first time on microplastics in brackish environments and compared to communities in the surrounding water and on the natural substrate wood. With Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing, more than 500 different eukaryotic taxa were detected on the microplastics samples. Among them were various green algae, dinoflagellates, ciliates, fungi, fungal-like protists and small metazoans such as nematodes and rotifers. The most abundant organisms was a dinoflagellate of the genus Pfiesteria, which could include fish pathogenic and bloom forming toxigenic species. Network analyses revealed that there were numerous interaction possibilities among prokaryotes and eukaryotes in microplastics biofilms. [...]",

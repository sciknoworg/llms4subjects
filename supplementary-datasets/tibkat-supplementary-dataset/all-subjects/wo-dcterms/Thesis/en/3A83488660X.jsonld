            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: Deadwood is gaining greater importance in the context of forestry activities. The forestry sector meanwhile has realized that the promotion and preservation of natural dead-wood occurrences is of immense importance for ecosystem services, since it serves as a reservoir for biological and functional diversity. An important objective of this comprehensive study/ thesis was to explore the impact of different forest management intensities on the microbial diversity in deadwood of the two in Germany silviculturally important tree species <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> and <i>Picea abies</i>. Furthermore, the relationship be-tween tree species-specific physico-chemical properties and the associated changes of microbial diversity and species composition should be elucidated. A significant methodological focus was on the combination of modern molecular techniques (\"Next-generation sequencing\") together with classical field (-observation) mycology. This recent thesis comprises three independent but complementary chapters.<i>Chapter 2</i> encompasses a study on the diversity and structure of fungal communities in the deadwood of the two above mentioned tree species <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> and <i>Picea abies</i>. This study further investigates the relation between physico-chemical properties and fungal diversity and whether an increase in diversity refers to higher lignin-modifying enzyme activities and increased wood decomposition rates, respectively. The study combines 454 pyrosequencing (to identify the fungal community), enzyme assays and chemical elements analyses (mass spectrography). The work presents the first comparison of the deadwood (-ecosystems) of these two economically relevant coniferous and deciduous tree species. The results revealed that the fungal communities strongly correspond to the specific deadwood substrate, which occurred to be independently from the surrounding habitat. This fact clearly relates to the specific substrate properties. The results further revealed that forest management type (age class managed beech and spruce forests versus extensively managed beech forests) significantly impacts the fungal community structure on the according forest plots. Both tree species also displayed distinct fungal successional patterns (dynamics). White-rot causing <i>Resinicium bicolor</i>, for example, occurred to be dominant on <i>Picea abies</i> deadwood logs of all decay stages, whereas members of the <i>Xylariaceae</i> were dominating  ...",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Phosphorylated biomolecules are essential in all living organisms. They act as cofactors, intra- and extracellular signaling molecules or are important metabolic intermediates. Some of them have been known since decades and their functions are well understood. However, there are still many structures whose functions remain elusive. Thiamine triphosphate and to some extent dinucleoside polyphosphates are examples for the latter. <br><br>One essential way to obtain and study these phosphorylated compounds is chemical synthesis. Many strategies and synthesis protocols have been developed. However, synthesis and purification are still challenging until today. In this thesis, the phosphoramidite approach was chosen to get access to phosphorylated compounds like thiamine triphosphate. Furthermore, novel phosphoramidites were designed to obtain photocaged prometabolites of thiamine di- and triphosphate. Based on the phosphoramidite approach, the successful synthesis of adenosine triphosphate derivatives, modified at the \u03b3-phosphate, and phosphorylation during a semi-synthesis of a cholesterol analogue were achieved. In addition, a bidirectional approach, based on P(III) reagents, towards asymmetric dinucleoside polyphosphates and related structures is presented",

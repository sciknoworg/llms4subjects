            "abstract": "The sense of smell is critical for finding food and mediating emotional and social responses. A dysfunction of this sense is often associated with diseases. In the last two decades much progress has been made in this research field and insights in how the sensation of smell is perceived has been gained. This thesis covers two topics of basic research in olfaction and is accordingly subdivided: 1. Various olfactory receptor neuron subsets exist in the olfactory epithelium. One classification of these subsets can be made according to the transduction mechanism of odorants. The olfactory receptor neurons belonging to one subset transduce odorants into depolarizations using the cAMP-dependent transduction mechanism. To date, it is not possible to stain this subset or to interfere with their generator channels with potent and specific blockers. In this thesis, the styryl dye FM1-43 was identified as a marker for olfactory receptor neurons endowed with cAMP-dependent transduction machinery. The dye is internalized in neurons by uptake through cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, the generator channel of the cAMP-dependent olfactory receptor neurons. This was proven by interference of FM1-43 uptake with divalent ions and unspecific cyclic nucleotide-gated channel blockers used in high concentrations and further confirmed by evoking responses to cAMP and forskolin in FM1-43-stained cells ...",

            "title": "Sibling dynamics in academic socialization within the family context",
            "abstract": "When it comes to academic socialization in the family context, many studies have addressed how parents influence their children\u2019s educational outcomes (Jeynes, 2003), and a number of studies have shown that the ways in which parents influence their children\u2019s educational outcomes differ by the macro influences of socioeconomic status or culture (Kim et al., 2020; Yamamoto & Sonnenschein, 2016). In comparison, less is known about the dynamics of academic socialization by individual children within a family. Eccles and colleagues (Eccles, Arberton, et al., 1993) proposed a model of family influences on children\u2019s motivation and achievement. The model hypothesized the joint influence of family characteristics and child/sibling characteristics on parents\u2019 beliefs and behaviors, which in turn affect children\u2019s educational development. The model highlighted bidirectional influences not only between parents and children but also between siblings. Whereas most relevant studies and reviews of the model (Eccles, 2007; Wigfield et al., 2015) have centered on effects of family characteristics and parents\u2019 beliefs and behaviors on children\u2019s educational outcomes, the current dissertation alternatively focused on the hypothesized effects of a child\u2019s characteristics on parents and on the child\u2019s own academic self-concept as well as siblings\u2019 academic self-concepts. Drawing from the model suggested by Eccles and colleagues (Eccles, Arberton, et al., 1993), I tested four hypotheses in the current dissertation. First, I constructed hypotheses about each child\u2019s individual experiences as well as a sibling\u2019s shared experiences with their parents in the family. Second, I hypothesized effects of each individual child\u2019s achievement on their own academic self-concepts and their sibling\u2019s academic self-concepts. Third, I hypothesized effects of each individual child\u2019s achievement and motivation on their parents\u2019 beliefs and parental support. Fourth, I focused on effects of sibling resemblance on comparison processes between siblings and parents\u2019 similar or differential support for the siblings\u2019 learning. To address the four hypotheses, the current dissertation included three empirical studies. The first study (Sibling Achievement as an Additional Frame of Reference for Parents\u2019 Beliefs About Each Child\u2019s Academic Ability) focused on parents\u2019 beliefs about each sibling\u2019s academic abilities. To provide empirical evidence for parents\u2019 child-specific ability beliefs, the first study used secondary data (Gladstone et al., 2018) from 95 families collected in two academic-track secondary schools in a rural area of Germany and examined how much variance in parental beliefs could be explained by each parent\u2019s child-specific response compared with the variance present at the child, parent, and family levels. To investigate the formation of parents\u2019 child-specific ability beliefs, the study further addressed effects of siblings\u2019 achievement on parents\u2019 beliefs about each child\u2019s academic ability. We explored whether each parent used the other sibling\u2019s achievement as an additional frame of reference for their beliefs about a child\u2019s abilities within and across domains by applying the internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model (Marsh, 1986b; M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013). The results of a multilevel analysis showed substantial variance in parents\u2019 beliefs at all levels of influence within the family. More specifically, parents\u2019 beliefs about children\u2019s academic abilities varied on the family level, indicating that parents\u2019 beliefs differed from one family to another; varied on the parental level, indicating that parents\u2019 general beliefs about siblings\u2019 academic abilities differed between the mother and father; varied on the sibling level, indicating that both parents\u2019 child-specific beliefs differed between siblings; and varied on the level of each child, indicating that each parent\u2019s child-specific beliefs differed between siblings. These findings newly verified the hierarchical structure of parents\u2019 child-specific beliefs about children\u2019s academic abilities influenced by the multiple levels of influence from different socialization agents within the family. Additionally, the study provided tentative evidence that both the mother and father used each child\u2019s own achievement and their sibling\u2019s achievement as frames of reference for their beliefs about the child\u2019s academic abilities within and across domains, yet the results did not show the clear pattern of the I/E model (Marsh, 1986b; M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013). Overall, the findings of the first study are in line with the hypotheses proposed by Eccles and colleagues (Eccles, Arberton, et al., 1993). The second study (Why Do Siblings Differ in Their Learning Motivation and Perceptions of Parental Support? Reciprocal Relationships Between Parental Support and Each Sibling\u2019s Learning Motivation) investigated whether the reciprocal associations between diverse dimensions of perceived parental support (parents\u2019 expectations, parents\u2019 emotional support, parents\u2019 learning encouragement, and parental control) and children\u2019s learning motivation differed between siblings. Using data from 2,082 school-aged twins collected at age 11 and age 13, we tested reciprocal associations within and between twin pairs across the 2 years, holding individual children\u2019s characteristics of sex, school grades, and personality traits constant. By comparing monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, we further verified whether the resemblance between siblings affected the reciprocal associations in within- and between-pair regressions. The results showed that there were significant reciprocal associations between an individual child\u2019s perceptions of their parents\u2019 learning encouragement and their learning motivation across ages 11 and 13, but only in the within-twin-pair regression for DZ twins. This means that the reciprocal relationships differed within DZ twin pairs, indicating the siblings\u2019 individualized academic socialization with parents across the 2 years. Such effects were not observed for the other dimensions of parental support or for MZ twins. MZ and DZ twins differed in particular in effects of learning motivation at age 11 on their perceptions of parents\u2019 learning encouragement at age 13. The substantial differences between MZ and DZ twins signified the effects of sibling resemblance on how parents supported the siblings in similar or different ways. Overall, the findings point to motivational dynamics and each child\u2019s individualized interactions with their parents within the family. The third study (What Happens With Comparison Processes When \u201cthe Other\u201d is Very Similar? Academic Self-Concept Formation in Twins) investigated effects of individual children\u2019s and their siblings\u2019 achievement on their academic self-concepts, using data from 4,208 twins at age 11 and age 17. Applying the I/E model (Marsh, 1986b), the third study examined whether twin\u2019s and co-twin\u2019s academic achievement affected individual twin\u2019s academic self-concept within and across domains. In addition, the study further compared MZ with DZ twin pairs to determine whether they differed in co-twin\u2019s achievement effects on twin\u2019s academic self-concept to test whether sibling resemblance moderates social comparison processes within twin pairs, in line with social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954). Drawing on the pattern suggested by the I/E model, both MZ and DZ twins used their own achievement as a frame of reference for their academic self-concepts within and across domains (Marsh, 1986b). Yet, only MZ twins further used their sibling\u2019s achievement as an additional frame of reference for their academic self-concept within and across domains, showing the similar I/E pattern in effects of their own achievement on their academic self-concept. This finding provided new empirical evidence for a strong assimilation within perfectly similar sibling pairs, which is referred to and theorized as a mirror effect in the current study. Despite being similar to each other, DZ twins did not show the mirror effect but showed sibling deidentification or nonreferencing (Whiteman et al., 2007; Whiteman, McHale, et al., 2011) because they did not consider their sibling\u2019s achievement as a frame of reference for their academic self-concept within and across domains. Overall, the findings from the three studies showed the reciprocal effects of individual children\u2019s and sibling\u2019s achievement and learning motivation on their academic socialization from their parents and their academic self-concepts. Accordingly, the studies provided empirical support for the four hypotheses and for the model of family influences on children\u2019s motivation and achievement proposed by Eccles, Arberton, et al. (1993). From a theoretical perspective, the studies produced new insights into the effects of children\u2019s characteristics on the diversity in academic socialization between siblings, which has garnered relatively little attention to date. In addition, by conducting interdisciplinary research, the dissertation showed the relevance and usefulness of applying the I/E model and the transactional model of parenting to address how children\u2019s and siblings\u2019 characteristics reciprocally affect parenting and children\u2019s educational outcomes. From a methodological perspective, multilevel analysis, cross-lagged modeling, and multiple-group analyses within a family are suggested to investigate dynamic academic socialization within the family. The dissertation suggests a new perspective on the model proposed by Eccles and colleagues (1993) and the best method to investigate dynamic academic socialization within the family.",

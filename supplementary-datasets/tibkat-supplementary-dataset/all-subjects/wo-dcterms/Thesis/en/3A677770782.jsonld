            "abstract": "In this thesis we look at results concerning two separate topics.The first topic belongs to the general problem of reconstruction of interaction networks using only per-site information. In chapter 2 a method for exact reconstruction of leaky integrate-and-fire networks from spike time data is presented. This method is capable of reconstructing networks of several hundred neurons in a relatively short time; it is not only a significant advance on the current state of the art with respect to model neuron networks, it stands as a proof in principle that the problem of exact reconstruction of pulse-coupled networks is not inherently intractable due to discrete interactions. The second topic is the relation between Potts / Ising models from statistical physics and the chromatic polynomial from graph theory. Chapter 3 presents a new method for computing the chromatic polynomial of a given graph based on algebraic operators that can be implemented with simple match-and-replace rules in any symbolic math system. On strip lattices the running time of the new method is competitive with previous specialized lattice-based methods from statistical physics; however, it is also capable of working on arbitrary graphs without modification, so vastly expands the structural range of graphs that can be accessed. Among the results presented ...",

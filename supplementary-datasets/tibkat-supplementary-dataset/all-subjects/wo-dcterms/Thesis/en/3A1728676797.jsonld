            "abstract": "Abstract: The aim of this study is to evaluate in vitro the accuracy of various intraoral scanning devices by comparing digitized dental impressions of teeth prepared for full dental arch fixed restorations. A basic study model (Kavo\u00ae, Biberach, Germany) with 14 prepared abutments was replicated using a polyurethane material and was used as the reference model (RM). The reference model was digitised (n=5) using an industrial reference scanner, as well as four intraoral digital impression devices (iTero, CEREC AC Bluecam, Lava C.O.S., and Zfx IntraScan). All datasets were converted to the standardized STL format and loaded into 3D inspection software (Geomagic Qualify\u2122 2012, Geomagic, Morrisville, USA). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to reveal statistically significant differences among groups, comparing scans among different devices (trueness) along with scans performed by the same device( precision). A level of statistical significance of p < 0.05 was set. Mean trueness values ranged from 38 to 332.9 \u03bcm. The MIXED procedure revealed statistically significant differences for the mean trueness values between CEREC AC Bluecam and all other tested scanners as well as between Zfx Intrascan and Lava C.O.S. Mean precision values ranged from 37.9 to 99.1 \u03bcm. The analysis yielded statistically significant differences between CEREC AC Bluecam and iTero, CEREC AC Bluecam and Lava C.O.S., Zfx Intrascan and Lava C.O.S., and Zfx Intrascan and iTero. With the exception of Cerec AC Bluecam, all intraoral scanners tested in this study exhibited comparable results of accuracy for full-arch scans of prepared teeth. However, more in vivo studies are required to verify the results of this study",

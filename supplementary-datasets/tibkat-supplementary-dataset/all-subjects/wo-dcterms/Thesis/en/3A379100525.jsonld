            "abstract": "Medical images from the commonly used diagnostic tools in surgical applications, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR), provide highly accurate and informative insight into internal anatomical structure and function, but typically contain no information on the coordinate system of the patient during the operation. In a conventional surgical procedure, correspondences between the medical images and the position of the patient in the operation room are drawn mentally by the surgeon. The clinical outcome of such an operation is therefore much dependent on the surgical skill and the state of mind of the surgeon during the surgical intervention. These limitations have been highly minimized by the emergence of Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS), in which a computer system accurately controls the execution of an operation, whose plan is often generated from preoperative images. A key problem in CAS is registration - the process of aligning datasets to the same coordinate frame. This dissertation explores the possibility of employing a non-invasive registration technique using a high resolution pulsed laser radar system in computer assisted hip-joint replacement surgery. The method involves acquiring 3D laser surface points of the anatomical part to be operated on intraoperatively, which are then registered to a 3D surface model from preoperative MR images. The registration analysis in this work was carried out with respect to the hip-joint socket (acetabulum). It is demonstrated that the registration technique is robust in the presence of spurious signals from the surgical site",

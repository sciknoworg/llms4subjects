                "Education plays a central role for Sustainable Development. In Madagascar, most of the population only completes primary education, making Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) highly relevant already for primary level. To date, ESD is only marginally implemented in Malagasy primary education. Therefore, the present work focuses on the preconditions for an ESD-oriented further development of primary school curricula and teacher training in Madagascar. The present research investigates which topics are suitable for regionally relevant ESD teaching. Furthermore, the procedural knowledge of Malagasy primary school teachers as precondition for teaching the identified topics is analyzed. The study region is the SAVA-region in North-East Madagascar.A qualitative analysis of Malagasy primary school curricula revealed starting points for ESD. In particular, the analysis identified references to SDGs 12 and 15 (focus Land use) and SDGs 2, 3, and 6 (focus Health). Within the scope of a Delphi study (N=34) corresponding courses of action regarding three Land-use and four Health topics for teaching regionally relevant ESD in the SAVA region were developed. The experts estimated the courses of action regarding their effectiveness and possibility of implementation. The results of the Delphi study served as benchmark for measuring primary school teachers (N=286) Land-use and Health procedural knowledge. An analysis through Item-Response-Theory revealed strengths and weaknesses of the teachers regarding their procedural knowledge in the different Land-use and Health topics. Furthermore, groups of teachers were compared regarding their procedural knowledge based on different diversity dimensions.The results indicate that procedural knowledge currently only plays a minor role for ESD in Malagasy school and teacher education. Teacher procedural knowledge that results from personal experience (e.g., agricultural activities), however, represents a potential for teaching ESD in the SAVA-region.The results of the present study allow for concrete suggestions regarding the individual suitability of the identified Land-use and Health topics for a regionally relevant ESD in the SAVA-region. Teaching Land-use topics should consider not only ecological but also economic perspectives, in particular. For teaching Health topics, the relation to local conditions of the school community is highly relevant. Through the concrete recommendations, the results of the present study can contribute to and evidence-based further development of a regionally relevant ESD in the SAVA region.$yLinzenz",

                "An interesting subclass of the SLs are Cers, the simplest SLs. Cers are assigned a special role within SLs because of their involvement in many cellular and biophysical processes.In literature Cers are describe to modulate many events in signaling including apoptosis. Besides its role as second messenger and therefore the involvement in many signal cascades, Cers are also known to be essential in physical modifications and structural alternations of membranes. Such regulatory functions on membrane formation are e.g. domain formation with other lipids (i.g. SM and Chol), phase separation with sterols (Chol), vesicular trafficking, fusion, membrane curvature fluidity and thickness and the induction of membrane leakiness. In contrast to phospholipids, Cers can move from one side of the membrane leaflet to the other, due to their strong hydrophobicity. This movement is called flip-flop or as transbilayer movement and is controversially discussed. Consequently, no exact value has been reported about the flip-flop property of Cers, which probably plays an important role during the transmission of an extra cellular signal through the membrane.In order to probe the biophysical properties of ceramides, a synthetic access to 1-thioceramides (1-SHCer) analogues with different N-acyl chain length has been developed in this study. With 1SHCer the flip-flop was investigated on pre-formed liposomes and the data indicated a very rapid flip-flop of Cers with a half time t1/2 <10s in raft- and ..."

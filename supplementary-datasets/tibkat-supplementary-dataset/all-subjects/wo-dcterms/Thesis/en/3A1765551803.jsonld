            "abstract": "For treatment of severe bone fractures and damage, synthetic bone grafts have extensively been used as substituting natural bone tissue. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is being extensively used for numerous biomedical applications, specially in orthopaedics and bone replacement applications because of its resemblance to the inorganic part of natural bone. This work aimed to develop novel substituted hydroxyapatite materials having antibacterial properties, as a potential approach to address infection problems in orthopaedic surgeries. This thesis presents a variety of novel single and co-substituted HA powders synthesized by wet precipitation and solid-state methods; afterwards, characterisation of the new materials was carried out using several techniques to determine the crystallographic structure, physiochemical properties, elemental composition, antibacterial and cellular properties of novel substituted HA powders. The new compositions are characterized by substitution of different metal ions in HA, namely: selenite/selenate (SeO3 2- or SeO4 2-), cerium (Ce3+ or Ce4+), copper (Cu+ or Cu2+), and strontium (Sr2+) in various concentrations to improve antibacterial activity, and so to prevent the demand for the usage of antibiotics. Crystallographic studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement were performed to explain the effect of ion substitution on the HA lattice structure. The compositional and morphological analysis was carried out by using X-ray powder fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), respectively. Complete chemical recognition was carried out with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy to reveal the functional groups present in substituted HA. Biological studies of substituted HA using both direct and in-direct cell culture routes revealed positive cell response with MG-63 and MC3T3-E1 cell lines. Disc diffusion method and turbidity measurements were used to evaluate antibacterial properties of samples against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus carnosus ...",

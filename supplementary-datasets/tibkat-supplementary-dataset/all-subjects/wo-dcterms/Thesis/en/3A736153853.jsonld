            "abstract": "Sensorineuronal hearing loss (SNHL) is caused by the loss of inner ear hair cells and the degeneration of neurites of spiral ganglion neurons (SGN). Despite the degeneration of their neurites, cell bodies of SGNs survive for several years. Cochlear implants (CIs) are used to restore the hearing in patients with SNHL. The function of CIs is based on electrical stimulation of the cell bodies of SGNs via an electrode array, consisting of a number of platinum electrodes, which are enclosed in a silicone electrode carrier. The performance of CIs depends on the state of the electrode-nerve-interface. The encapsulation of CI-electrodes with connective tissues as a result of insertion trauma leads to an increase of the electrode-nerve impedance. Higher power consumption of the implant and a loss of selective stimulation of hearing nerve fibres are caused by the increased impedance. Therefore, the limitation of the adhesion and growth of connective tissue cells on the electrodes and electrode carriers of CIs is desired. The adhesion of cells to their environment regulates diverse cellular cues, such as migration and proliferation. Cell adhesion is highly dependent on physiochemical properties of material surfaces. These properties can be modulated for selective adhesion and growth of particular cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of physically and chemically modified substrate surfaces on adhesion of fibroblasts as a model for connective tissue cells. In order to investigate the adhesion strength of fibroblasts, single cell force spectroscopy based on atomic force microscopy was used. It was hypothesized that anti-wetting surfaces as a result of altering surface topographies decrease the adhesion of fibroblasts. We further hypothesized that hydrophilic polymer surfaces reduce the strength of cell adhesion. The results indicate that cells can adjust their morphology in response to material surface topography changes. Consequently, the adhesion of cells correlated with the cell-surface contact area positively. We concluded that physical alteration of surfaces for producing anti-adhesive surfaces should be rather based on reducing the cell-surface contact area than on the reduction of surface wettability. The second hypothesis was proved and the adhesion of fibroblasts to hydrophilic polymer surfaces was diminished. It was concluded that due to the leak of proper polymer surface-bound extracellular matrix the attachment of cells to surfaces was inhibited. In conclusion, the modification of material surfaces influenced the adhesion of cells by two mechanisms: first, by changing the cell-surface contact area and second, by affecting the adsorption of the extracellular matrix components.",

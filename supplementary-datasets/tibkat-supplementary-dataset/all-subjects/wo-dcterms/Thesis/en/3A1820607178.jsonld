            "abstract": "Social commerce initiatives represent an increasingly lucrative instrument for companies to facilitate social interactions on e-commerce platforms and thereby provide consumers a more attractive shopping experience. However, little is known through which mechanisms social commerce initiatives work and how such initiatives can be successfully designed. The objective of the cumulative dissertation is to obtain a profound understanding about the potential of social commerce initiatives and how this potential can be increased. The dissertation begins with a systematic review of the social commerce literature to provide a structured and comprehensive overview about the factors influencing consumers' social commerce engagement. Building upon the results of the literature review, an integrated research model is developed that serves a conceptual framework to study the effects of social commerce features systematically. Using this framework as a guideline, several experimental studies are thereafter conducted to obtain knowledge about the effective combination of social commerce features. To demonstrate how social commerce features can be effectively combined, the dissertation introduces the concept of social commerce feature richness. The greater the functional diversity that is provided by a set of social commerce features on an e-commerce platform, the higher the level of social commerce feature richness. The results of the experimental studies demonstrate that the social commerce feature richness is an important aspect in the design of social commerce initiatives as it can positively affect consumers' buying intention and increase platform stickiness. To support the goal-driven design of social commerce initiatives, the dissertation furthermore develops a method that enables companies to systematically select multiple, functionally complementary social commerce features. Overall, the results of the dissertation provide important contributions to research and practice in information systems, especially in the domain of e-commerce.",

            "abstract": "Leg development and its underlying genetic and molececular mechanisms are best understood in the prime insect model Drosophila melanogaster and this knowledge can serve as a first guide to study leg development in other arthropod species. The pattering of the proximo-distal axis in the leg is guided by a hierarchic gene cascade and the morphogens Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) are the key factors which control the expression of proximo-distal patterning genes at the next level of the cascade. Beside its function in distal development, wg is also crucial for the allocation of the the limb primordia and specification of ventral cell fate in the leg. The development of the leg in Drosophila melanogaster presents a highly derived mode of arthropod leg development and differs from other insects and arthropod groups, where the limbs are direct outgrowths of the embryonic body wall. Recent work provides evidence against a conservation of the Wg/Dpp leg pattering system. Although the expression pattern of wg is highly conserved in arthropods, functional studies in the insects Oncopeltus and Gryllus could not support a role of wg in leg development of these species. At least, in the coleopteran Tribolium castaneum a role of wg in leg allocation could be proven. Also the role of dpp in leg development has been questioned. The expression of dpp is not conserved between Drosophila and other arthropod species and indicates a non-conserved role of dpp in limb development of arthropods. In the first part of this thesis, I present a functional analysis of wg and dpp in leg development in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum ...",

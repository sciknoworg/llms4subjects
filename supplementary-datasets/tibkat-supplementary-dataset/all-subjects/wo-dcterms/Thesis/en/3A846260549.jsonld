            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: Biofuel cells show great potential for the environment-friendly direct conversion of chemically stored energy into electricity. Microbial fuel cells use microorganisms and enzymatic fuel cells use purified enzymes as electro-catalysts. This omits the need to supply expensive noble metal catalysts. Microbial fuel cells typically have longer lifetimes than enzymatic fuel cells because microorganisms are able to regenerate, while enzymes usually degrade or become inactivated more quickly. The enzyme purification procedure is also time consuming and costly. However, higher current densities can typically be achieved with enzymatic fuel cells. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to combine the advantages of microbial (typically longer lifetimes) and enzymatic (typically higher current densities) fuel cells.Results described in this thesis show, for the first time, that supernatants of different enzyme-secreting microorganisms such as yeast, fungi and bacteria can be used to supply unpurified enzymes to the electrodes of biofuel cells without the addition of mediators. This obviates the need for elaborate and expensive enzyme purification, and simplifies the construction process. Furthermore, this thesis shows a first demonstration that with regular re-supply of fresh enzyme-containing culture supernatant, the lifetime of an enzymatic electrode can be extended. Therefore, the construction of a self-regenerating biofuel cell in which enzyme-secreting microorganisms continuously supply catalysts at the electrode could be feasible.At the cathode, laccase-containing supernatant (3.4 U mL-1 laccase, pH 5) of the fungus T. versicolor yielded the best cathode performance with current densities of 129 \u00b1 19 \u00b5A cm-2 at 0.644 V vs. NHE. The achieved current density was even slightly higher than the current density recorded for cathodes supplied with purified laccase of the same activity. With laccase-containing supernatant (0.06 U mL-1 laccase, pH5) from the recombinant yeast Y. lipolytica YL4, a current density of 6.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcA cm\u22122 at 0.644 V vs. NHE was achieved. The use of a copper efflux oxidase (CueO)-containing supernatant (0.034 * 10-1 U mL-1 CueO, pH 5) of E.coliCueO resulted in a high current density of 119 \u00b1 23 \u03bcA cm\u22122 , similar to the results achieved with supernatant of T. versicolor, but at a lower potential of 0.400 V vs. NHE, due to the lower redox potential of CueO. In contrast to laccase-containing supernatant, CueO- ...",

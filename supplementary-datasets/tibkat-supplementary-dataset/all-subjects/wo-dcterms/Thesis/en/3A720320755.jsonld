            "abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases are fatal disorders mainly affecting highly energy dependent tissues such as brain, heart, liver and muscle. These severe disorders can be caused by mutations affecting mitochondrial- or nuclear-encoded proteins. The molecular function of many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins involved in disease is unknown so far and therefore, the mechanisms that lead to disease are enigmatic. In this study, point mutations in SURF1 and MPV17 were analyzed that were found in patients of the Leigh Syndrome and the Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome respectively. These missense mutations affect highly conserved and therefore potentially functional important amino acids. The function of SURF1, a highly conserved early assembly factor of the cytochrome c oxidase, has been studied using its yeast homolog Shy1. Shy1 is involved in the maturation and translational feed back regulation of Cox1, the central subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase. In this study, it was shown that patient point mutations affecting G124 in SURF1 lead to rapid degradation of the protein after mitochondrial import. In contrast, patient mutations that lead to an Y274D exchange in SURF1 do not alter mitochondrial import or stability but showed increased association to a newly identified cytochrome c oxidase assembly intermediate. Hence, SURF1Y274D shows impaired function. Using the corresponding yeast Shy1Y344D as a model, dual functionality of SURF1/Shy1 could be shown. Shy1Y344D releases cytochrome c oxidase assembly intermediates from translational feed back regulation of Cox1 but fails to promote cytochrome c oxidase assembly at later steps ...",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 In-depth qualitative data gathered from at two innovative start-ups. Two ethnographic studies were conducted. The data are based on participatory observations, interviews, and secondary sources, each of which included a three months field study and a total of 41 interviews from both organizations. Findings \u2013 The thesis provides explanations for the practice of freedom and the control of creativity within organizations and expands the existing theory of neo-normative control.

            "abstract": "Ear rot caused by Fusarium spp. is a serious disease of maize plants worldwide, which can be divided in two types: Red ear rot or Gibberella ear rot (GER), and Pink ear rot or Fusarium ear rot (FER). Apart from impairment of the yield, it leads to quality losses due to accumulation of mycotoxins in food and feed which lead to serious health impairment of human and animals. The most problematic Fusarium mycotoxins occurring in Germany are deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and fumonisins. Deoxynivalenol and zearalenone are produced by F. graminearum, the most important causal agent of Red ear rot, while fumonisins are produced F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, which are mostly isolated from cobs with Pink ear rot symptoms. For epidemiological studies, species-specific determination of fungal biomass is required. In previous works, a real-time PCR assays for species-specific quantification of the biomass of F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum were established. With the help of receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the relationship between sensitivity and specificity was investigated and the optimal cut off point and was determined. Because whole maize plants are used for silage for livestock feeding, the spread of fungal mycelium of F. graminearum and the presence of mycotoxins in the stem below and above artificially inoculated cobs was investigated. To study the importance of the harvest time points, the accumulation of fungal biomass and mycotoxins was determined at silage maturity and grain maturity. It is shown that mycotoxins did hardly spread in the stems near the cob until silage harvest, but at grain maize maturity mycotoxins were found in the stems above and below the infected cob. In contrast to the mycotoxins, F. graminearum seems to grow more often in the stems above the infected cob. No correlation was found between ear rot symptoms in the cob and mycotoxin contamination in the stems ...",

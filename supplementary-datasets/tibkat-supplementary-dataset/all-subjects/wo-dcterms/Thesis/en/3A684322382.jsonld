            "abstract": "The brain is one of the most complex organs in animals. It allows the coordination of complex operations like orientation and directed movements. In insects, a structure in the brain has been identified that represents the superordinate center where such operations are processed. This center is called the Central Complex and encompasses five different subneuropilar structures in the adult insect brain. In Schistocerca embryos and Drosophila pupae, the respective progenitor cells, so called neuroblasts, were identified. However, only little is known about the molecular genetic background that enables the formation of the Central Complex. Respective embryonic genetic studies are not possible in Drosophila, since the Central Complex develops later during larval stages. In contrast, Tribolium castaneum larvae form a reduced Central Complex during embryogenesis which is easily accessible for genetic functional studies. Therefore, Tribolium was chosen to establish a new system to\u00ednvestigate embryonic insect brain development. As a prerequisite for this aim, transgenic reporter lines were established, that allow studies of brain development in Tribolium castaneum. A transgenic line, where the regulatory regions of the Tribolium homologue to reversed polarity drives the reporter gene tGFP, was generated (reg. Tc-repo::tGFP). This line `reg. Tc-repo::tGFP \u0301appears to mark a subset of glial cells in the larval brain. Additionally, transgenic reporter lines, which should enable tracing of neuroblast development from the onset to the respective fully developed structure in the brain were generated ...",

                "In the search for new antifungal agents, this study dealt with the antimicrobial screening, extraction, isolation, structural elucidation as well as selective biological investigations of the isolated compounds. In addition, the impact of the culture conditions on growth and on biosynthesis of bioactive compounds was also studied. Besides, selective cyanobacteria were axenized and the taxonomy as well as the genetic relationship of axenic cyanobacteria that produced bioactive compounds with some other cyanobacteria was identified basing on the 16S rRNA gene sequences. 22 Vietnamese and 6 German cyanobacterial strains were screened for their antifungal activity using the agar diffusion assay. Among them, the MeOH/water extract from the biomass obtained from a laboratory culture of strain Bio 33, isolated from the Baltic Sea near R\u00fcgen Island, exhibited a specific antifungal activity against Candida maltosa and others human pathogenous fungi such as Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Aspergillus fumigatus, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum and Mucor sp. Besides, it was very impressed that extracts of strain Bio 33 showed no antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The taxonomy basing on 16S rRNA gene sequence of the axenic Bio 33 identified this strain as Anabaena cylindrica species. As a result of the bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude MeOH/water extract, four new lipopeptides, named ...",

            "abstract": "ZnO nanowires, surface treatment, surface exciton, hydrogen doping, electron-hole-plasma, lasing, modal gain. - ZnO nanowires are promising building blocks for optoelectronic applications. Lasers and light-emitting diodes fabricated from ZnO nanowires will emit in the blue and near-UV spectral region due to the wide band gap of ZnO. Their large refractive index makes them useful as active waveguides in optoelectronic devices. In addition to the near UV emission, ZnO can show several defect related emission bands in the visible spectral region. By carefully doping the material, these defect bands can be tailored to generate a white-light spectrum which will be beneficial for applications as light emitting diodes. Much research interest focused on the various defect bands in the past years. Previous work of the author on ZnO nanowires embedded in polymer matrices shows a strong decrease of the defect luminescence for the embedded samples, combined with a stronger surface exciton emission band. In this work, the dependence of the defect and near-band-edge luminescence of ZnO nanowires on surrounding materials necessary to fabricate nanowire-LED devices is investigated. First, coating of the nanowires with a dielectric shell of amorphous Al2O3 is found to strongly suppress the defect luminescence while enhancing the surface excitonic emission. This effect is similar to the previously investigated polymer samples and is explained by a model based on the dielectric properties of the material. A dielectric coating shields the surface states and reduces the band bending typically observed for the ZnO nanowire surfaces. The band bending influences the activation mechanism of deep centers which cause the defect luminescence and redistributes the excitons near the surface in favour of the surface excitonic recombination mechanism. As a next step, the influence of metallic coatings on the optical properties of ZnO nanowires is investigated and found to result in an opposite behaviour compared to the dielectric coating. An increased defect luminescence and a reduced surface emission band are observed, completely independent of the work function of the metal. These findings are explained by the format on of metal-induced gap states at the nanowire surface, which trap excitons close to the surface. The interaction between plasmonic resonances of metal nanoparticles and excited states of semiconductors has attracted much attention in the research community. The use of a plasma sputter-coater is one method to deposit such metal nanoparticles. In this work, experimental evidence is presented which shows that the plasma of such a system itself changes the optical properties of ZnO nanowires by implantation of hydrogen into the crystal. The defect luminescence is weakened while the near-UV emission is enhanced, but does not show a stronger surface excitonic emission. The lifetime of the charge carriers excited by a fs laser is investigated in pump-and-probe experiments on ZnO bulk surfaces. Even at excitation densities below the lasing threshold, an electron-hole-plasma forms with lifetimes of several tens of picoseconds. In order to investigate the lasing properties of single ZnO nanowires, a setup based on the variable-stripe-length method is developed and used to determine the modal gain of single nanowires. When exciting with a fs laser, modal gain values of up to 4900 cm\u22121 are found which are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The gain is found to depend on the nanowire diameter.",

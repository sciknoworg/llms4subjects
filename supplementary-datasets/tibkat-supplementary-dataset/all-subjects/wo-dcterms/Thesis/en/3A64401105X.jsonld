            "abstract": "The interaction of clouds with radiation and aerosols is the greatest source of uncertainty in future climate projections. Part of the reason is the limited amount of observations of clouds and hence the limited knowledge of cloud macro- and microphysical statistics in connection to their effects on the radiative budget and on the vertical redistribution of energy within the atmosphere. In 2007, the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement programs (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF) was operated for a nine-month period in the Murg Valley, Black Forest, Germany, in support of the Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (COPS). Based on the measurements of the AMF and COPS partner instrumentation, the present study aims at improving the data basis of cloud macro- and microphysical statistics and to assess the potential of the derived cloud properties to estimate the radiative effects of clouds. The synergy of various instruments is exploited to derive a data set of high quality thermodynamic and cloud property profiles with a temporal resolution of 30 s. While quality filters in the cloud microphysical retrieval techniques mostly affect the representativity of ice and mixed clouds in the data sample, water clouds are very well represented in the derived 364,850 atmospheric profiles ...",

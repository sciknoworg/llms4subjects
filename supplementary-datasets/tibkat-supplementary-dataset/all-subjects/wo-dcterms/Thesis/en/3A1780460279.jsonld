            "abstract": "In colorectal cancer (CRC), it is assumed that epigenetic deregulations activate mechanisms associated with tumor differentiation such as the process of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) where tumor cells gain a spindle like phenotype necessary for dissemination and metastatic spread. However, how epigenetic alterations such as deregulation of chromatin modifiers or DNA methylation are involved in this complex program, that is reversible in nature, is only poorly understood. Recently, it was reported that absence of the cell cycle regulator p21WAF1 is connected with EMT features (downregulation of E-Cadherin and upregulation of Vimentin) and an increase of the EMT master transcription factor ZEB1 in colon and breast cancer cell lines. Thus, this PhD thesis aimed to analyze the effect of p21WAF1 on chromatin modification enzymes (CMEs) and to clarify the connection between chromatin modification and EMT. We used the p21WAF1 negative colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as an experimental tool to investigate EMT associated epigenetic alterations. Using a qPCR array, we identified a set of deregulated CMEs in HCT116 p21WAF1-/- cells compared to the HCT116 p21 wildtype cells. Combining our PCR based approach with a genome wide in silico analysis for E-Box binding sites specific for ZEB1 we identified five potential ZEB1 targets (AURKB, DNMT3B, RPS6KA3, SETD1B and SETDB2). SETD1B, a histone methyltransferase, that specifically sets the active H3K4me3 histone code, was chosen for further studies, since only little was known about this enzyme and its role in EMT. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), siRNA transfection and overexpression experiments we validated SETD1B as a novel transcriptional target of ZEB1. The ZEB1-SETD1B circuit seems to exist in 2D and in vivo as shown in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. A protein complex between ZEB1 and SETD1B was shown in silico. Interestingly ZEB1high/SETD1Bhigh tumors defined a high-risk subgroup of tumors with unfavorable prognosis. In a next step we ...",

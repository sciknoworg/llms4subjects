            "abstract": "The applications of non- and semiparametric models are found in nearly all fields of empirical research. Since nonparametric methods do not have restrictive assumptions about the distribution of the observations or functional forms of the underlying data generating process, they are attractive methods when other necessary assumptions cannot be assured. However, nonparametric methods might be limited in practice due to other questions like the curse of dimensionality or the true underlying degrees of freedom. By introducing partial parametric components that may allow one to match structural conditions, such as linearity in some variables, the semiparametric modeling compromises between flexibility and simplicity in statistical procedures. One may consider, as the basis for many semiparametric models, the well known generalized linear model. A different but also popular extension is still parametric but is nowadays often used as a bridge between parametric and non- or semiparametric models; adding random effects in this generalized linear model leads us to a generalized linear mixed effects model. The application of these models is put into practice under the independence assumption between random effects and the covariates ...",

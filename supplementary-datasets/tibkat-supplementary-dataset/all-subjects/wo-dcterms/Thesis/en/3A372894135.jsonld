                "The main objective of this work is to contribute to the understanding of the grafting of nitrogen and amino surface functional groups on polymers by means of plasmas containing nitrogen and hydrogen. For this purpose, many aspects of plasma surface modification were studied. In the frame of this work, a new, UHV-sealed plasma reactor system was put into operation. The system is special for its clean reaction environment and the possibility to perform quasi in situ XPS measurements. A comparison of the UHV system to a fine vacuum reactor showed that a clean reaction environment is mandatory for reproducible plasma processing and efficient nitrogen and amino functionalisation. A key motivation for the present work was the observation that the non-coating plasma processes reported in literature fail to graft primary amino groups on polymer surfaces with densities that significantly exceed 3 - 4% NH2/C. In order to investigate this phenomenon in detail, this work followed two experimental tracks: On the one hand, a broad systematic study of plasma processing parameters was performed ..."

            "abstract": "Silent information regulator 2 (SIR-2) proteins, also referred to as sirtuins, are highly conserved NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases that are emerging to be important energy sensors and regulators of metabolism, stress responses and aging. The mammalian sirtuin protein family is quite complex, comprising seven members (SIRT1 to SIRT7) with different subcellular localization (nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria). The mitochondrial SIRT4 remains the only mammalian sirtuin of which ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, but no NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity could be detected. SIRT4 negatively regulates insulin secretion and might be a therapeutic target for treatment of diabetes. However, this requires a better understanding of its biological and enzymatic function as well as identification of novel substrates. The simple multicellular organism C. elegans possesses only four SIR-2 variants (SIR-2.1 to SIR-2.4) that all show high sequence conservation to mammalian sirtuins. Overexpression of SIR-2.1 increases the life span of C. elegans, suggesting that these are also intriguing players in regulating longevity and in linking metabolism to aging-related processes. Whereas the majority of studies have focused on SIR-2.1, the variants SIR-2.2 and SIR-2.3, which are most homologous to mammalian SIRT4, remain by and large uncharacterized. In this PhD thesis I showed that SIR-2.2 and SIR-2.3 are also localized to mitochondria and are predominantly expressed in ...",

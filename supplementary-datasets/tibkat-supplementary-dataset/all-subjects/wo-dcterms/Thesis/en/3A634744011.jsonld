            "title": "Resolution of curvature singularities in black holes and the early universe",
            "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with two approaches on the singularity problem of the general theory of relativity. The first is of bottom-up nature. We start from Einstein's well established general relativity and make an educated guess for an asymptotically equivalent but non-singular theory. In the second approach we take the top-down perspective starting with the assumption that string theory gives the fundamental description of nature and analyse the resulting low energy effective theory. Our bottom-up approach is an application of the limiting curvature hypothesis to anisotropic cosmologies. This extends the success for isotropic cosmologies of Brandenberger et al. Applying the LCH, they constructed a theory in which all homogeneous and isotropic solutions are singularity free. Due to the non-analytic nature of the equations we were unable repeat the proof in the anisotropic case, but analytical and numerical analysis produce circumstantial evidence for a resolution of the singularity in this case as well. Generically this resolution seems not to involve a de Sitter phase as expected. Instead it would interpolate between a contracting anisotropic universe and a universe, that time-symmetrically expands anisotropically. During this transition spacetime evolves through a nearly flat, Minkowski phase. This solution could represent an alternative to the so-called bounce solutions as they appear in pre-big-bang scenarios. In our top-down approach we construct a simple model in type IIA super string theory. With a non-BPS D7 or D9 brane we introduce a tachyonic degree of freedom. Its potential is influenced by the compact background wrapped by the brane. In a way the mass can be tuned by the size of the compact dimension. We use a truncated action which was constructed in order to approximate the full string theory result for the dynamical creation and decay of non-BPS branes quite accurately ...",

            "abstract": "In humans deafness is caused by environmental but also by genetic factors. Mutations in the gene encoding otoferlin are one genetic cause of deafness, leading to DFNB9 an autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. The function of otoferlin is still not fully understood. It is suspected to act as the Ca2+ sensor for synaptic vesicle fusion at the inner hair cell ribbon synapse, and as a regulator of vesicle replenishment. We analyzed the most C-terminal C2 domain C2F in detail via CD-spectroscopy, fluorimetry and using a floatation assay. We did not find convincing evidence for Ca2+ and phospholipid binding. We also tested the effect of the pachanga mutation, a mutation that causes reduced speed of vesicle replenishment. C2FPga did not show any differences to C2Fwt in the biochemical assays, however analyzing protein and mRNA level we found that OtofPga/Pga animals have reduced otoferlin protein levels compared to wild type animals but increased mRNA levels. This may suggest that the cells try to compensate the lack of protein. To test the hypothesis that otoferlin is a synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) - like Ca2+ sensor we tried to replace otoferlin with Syt1, the major Ca2+ sensor at conventional synapses. We established viral gene transfer into IHCs using transuterine injection of the embryonic otocyst and expressed Syt1 in IHCs of deaf Otof-/- mice. However, we did not find a rescue of the deafness phenotype. As a control experiment but also as a potential gene therapy approach we expressed otoferlin in the Otof-/- mice via the same technique and again we were not able to restore hearing. Nevertheless this may open up a strategy to test mutated otoferlin in vitro ...",

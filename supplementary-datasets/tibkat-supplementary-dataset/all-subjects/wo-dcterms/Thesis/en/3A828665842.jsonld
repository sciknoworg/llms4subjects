            "abstract": "One of the characteristic features of Wolfram's 'Parzival' is a narrative technique of holding back information that is crucial for the understanding of what is happening. The intention of this technique is to let the audience share the protagonist's experience of uncertainty and to test its ability for compassion. It has long been acknowledged that the narrator reflects upon this narrative technique on several occasions. However, less attention has been given to the possibility of poetological reflection that is inherent in the narratives and speeches of characters. Based on Genette's theory of narrative levels, Scheffel's thoughts on self-reflexivity of literature and Weber's definition of analytical narration, this thesis tries to show that many of the narratives and speeches produced by characters in 'Parzival' mirror the narrative technique of concealing vital information. Furthermore, the thesis analyses explanations and intentions that are related to these narratives and speeches and their (potential) effects on the protagonists and the audience and it draws conclusions with regard to the poetological concept of the novel.",

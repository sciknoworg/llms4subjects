            "abstract": "Bots are the root cause of many security problems on the Internet - they send spam, steal information from infected machines, and perform distributed denial of service attacks. Given their security impact, it is not surprising that a large number of techniques have been proposed that aim to detect and mitigate bots, both network-based and host-based approaches. Detecting bots at the network-level has a number of advantages over host based solutions, as it allows for the efficient analysis of a large number of hosts without the need for any end point installation. Currently, network-based botnet detection techniques often target the command and control traffic between the bots and their botmaster. Moreover, a significant majority of these techniques are based on the analysis of packet payloads. The proposed approaches range from simple pattern matching against signatures to structural analysis of command and control communication. Unfortunately, deep packet inspection is rendered increasingly ineffective as malware authors start to use obfuscated or encrypted command and control connections ...",

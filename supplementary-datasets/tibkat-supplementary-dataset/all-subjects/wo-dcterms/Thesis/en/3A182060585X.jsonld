            "abstract": "When identifying faces, the incoming face information is matched against mental face representations stored in memory. Accordingly, there must be a large number of representations in memory to account for the variety of familiar faces that one has encountered in life. The face space model of Valentine (1991) represents an abstract framework intended to explain and illustrate the retention of face representations in memory. This model describes a multidimensional space, in which face representations are located and organized on various face dimensions that reflect the specific characteristics of a face. This model, however, is defined just as incompletely as the general understanding of face identification. By focusing on the phenomena priming and adaptation, the present work aims to gain a better understanding of face processing and retention and thus the face space. A literature review on both phenomena provides important information about the structure and flexibility of the face space and the face representations contained therein. The results of two experimental studies on face adaptation further reveal information about the face characteristics that constitute the face representations. These studies are the first to systematically investigate the role of non configural face information (i.e., information that is not related to any spatial aspects of a face) in mental face representation. The study results support the assumption of a high flexibility and hierarchical structure of face representation in face space. However, in contrast to previous assumptions, face representations and categories probably cannot be clearly distinguished from each other but should be considered in a more dimensional way. Moreover, the empirical studies in this work suggest that different face information is most likely represented in face space with a different valence. This valence of face information is presumably closely related to the relevance of the information for face recognition. Together, these findings indicate that the current model of face space might need to be modified to account for the complex processes of face recognition.",

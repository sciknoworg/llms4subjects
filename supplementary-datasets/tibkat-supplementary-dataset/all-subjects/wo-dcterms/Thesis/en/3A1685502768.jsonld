            "abstract": "The assessment of disturbed well-being in laboratory animals due to experimental procedures is becoming increasingly important. However, existing methods are often subjective and insufficient; developing and establishing suitable methods is, therefore, of high relevance. The aim of this thesis was the analysis of voluntary wheel running as a parameter for the assessment of well-being under variable conditions and the evaluation of this parameter regarding its validity across different models. Voluntary wheel running was analysed in single-housing under restraint stress, combined with a faeces and urine collection procedure, as well as after laparotomy for pancreatic cancer induction and subsequent chemotherapy. Additionally, a group-housing system, which allowed recording of individual data via subcutaneously implanted radio-frequency identification transponders, was utilised. In this model, colitis was induced via dextran sulphate sodium administration and blood, faeces and urine sample collections were performed. Voluntary wheel running performance was able to depict the influence of all experimental procedures. In comparison to both clinical score and body weight, wheel running was superior in indicating mild influences and acute changes in well-being. A cluster model, developed via a k-means algorithm and suggested to depict severity levels on the basis of wheel running performance, was able to demonstrate high validity of wheel running for assessment of disturbed well-being on an individual basis.",

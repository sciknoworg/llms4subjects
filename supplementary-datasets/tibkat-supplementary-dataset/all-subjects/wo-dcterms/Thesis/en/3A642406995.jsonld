            "abstract": "Although the phylogeny and phylogeography of gibbons (Hylobatidae), a primate family endemic to Southeast Asia, has been studied in detail, phylogenetic relationships among taxa remain poorly resolved. Likewise, the number of taxa to be recognized is a matter of debate. This dissertation presents the most comprehensive phylogeny in respect to taxon sampling up to date and, hence, allows detailed insights into the phylogeny, phylogeography and taxonomy of gibbons, specifically of crested gibbons, genus Nomascus. While for the overall gibbon phylogeny only sequence data of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene were used, for crested gibbons, acoustic characteristics as obtained from female great calls and male multi-modulated calls were applied as additional independent marker. According to the obtained phylogeny, in which relationships among various gibbon lineages remain unresolved, and estimated divergence ages, four major radiations in the evolutionary history of gibbons are indicated. Gibbons most likely originated on the Southeast Asian mainland and diverged in an initial split in the late Miocene into genera. Hylobates experienced further radiations, which led to various species and subspecies ...",

            "abstract": "The present work is dealing with the theoretical description of laser-driven ion acceleration in the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) process. Various, one-dimensional models describing the laser-heated plasma expansion into vacuum are studied to derive principal relations between the initial conditions of the laser-target interaction --- such as electron parameters, laser and target properties --- and the ion spectra and maximum ion energies which can be observed in experiments. In the first part of this work, two different approaches for the description of the hot electron population are compared when applied to these models. It turns out that a hydrodynamic ansatz for the electron density, which has widely been used in the literature, is contained in the general kinetic treatment of the electrons under the assumption of a particular class of electron energy distributions. Especially, this class contains a step-like electron energy. The impact of a step-like hot electron energy distribution on the ion acceleration process is described in the second part of this thesis. The application of the various adiabatic plasma expansion models to the data from ultrashort-pulse experiments convincingly shows that the analytic results of the expansion model assuming a step-like electron energy distribution reproduce the observed maximum ion energies and the corresponding ion spectra quite well, while this is not the case for the models assuming Maxwellian electron distributions. The third part of this work covers the impact of an initial density gradient at the rear surface of the target. The developed model is able to closely reproduce the experimentally observed relation between the maximum ion energy and the initial target thickness. By using the model prepulse effects in the plasma expansion process can be considered, explaining the experimental observation of an optimal target thickness.",

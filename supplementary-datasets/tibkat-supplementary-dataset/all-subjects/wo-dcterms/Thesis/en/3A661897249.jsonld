            "abstract": "The remarkable capability of the nervous system of animals to adapt their behavioral responses to an ever-changing environmental conditions is thought to rely on the plasticity of neuronal circuits and synaptic connections. This capability reaches its highest form in the human brain. During aging, a marked decline is frequently observed in the performance of cognitive and memory tasks that require such plasticity. Age-associated memory loss and memory impairment during neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) affect millions of people worldwide. No treatment to this day has been successful in restoring these memory deficits. This lack of therapy is primarily due to the fact that little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to memory formation. A number of recent studies suggest that epigenetic factors may play a central role in memory formation and age related pathologies. In addition to the role of transcription factors, the availability of genes for transcription is controlled by a series of proteins that regulate epigenetic chromatin remodeling, especially histone-acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone-deacetylases (HDACs). The goal of this research was to further elucidate the molecular and cellular terms of how the aging process modifies the capability of the hippocampus to generate plastic responses and the consequences that epigenetic alterations have in learning and memory in elderly mice ...",

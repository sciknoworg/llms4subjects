            "abstract": "AD mouse models contributed widely to our understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and represent invaluable tools in testing potential therapeutic interventions. In the present study, age-dependent characterization of the neuropathological and behavioral hallmarks of the 5XFAD mouse model was performed, demonstrating that the 5XFAD mouse model develops a variety of AD neuropathological and behavioral hallmarks. It was shown for the first time that the 5XFAD mice develop neurological and motor phenotypes, which coincide with spinal cord pathology such axonopathy and intraneuronal (amyloid beta) A\u00e2. One of the most important characteristics originally reported in the 5XFAD mouse model is the neuron loss; however, this was never appropriately quantified. Using designed-based stereology, it was shown that the 5XFAD mice develop significant selective neuron loss in the fifth cortical of the frontal cortex which correlates with the accumulation of intraneuronal A\u00e2 peptides. The 5XFAD mouse model develops early age-dependent alterations in anxiety levels and impaired spatial working memory starting from 6 months of age. Employing a variety of A\u00e2 specific antibodies, abundant intraneuronal A\u00e2 and extracellular plaque deposition was noted and showed age-dependent alterations. Altogether, the simultaneous occurrence of age-dependent neuropathological and the behavioral changes present the 5XFAD mouse model as an invaluable model to study AD. More importantly, the cosegregation of the mutations in the 5XFAD facilitates its use to generate bigenic mouse models. pyroglutamate A\u00e2 (A\u00e2pE3-x) is a modified form of A\u00e2 which is particularly interesting due to its predominance in AD brains and its high pathogenicity ...",

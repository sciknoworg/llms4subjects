            "abstract": "This work describes the derivation of the energy dependent flux of ultra-high energy cosmic rays from data of very inclined air showers observed with the Pierre Auger Observatory. The Pierre Auger Observatory measures extensive air showers initiated by interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays with Earth's atmosphere. The properties of individual cosmic rays are not directly accessible and need to be reconstructed from the observed air showers. The observation is done with a combination of a surface and a fluorescence detector. The fluorescence detector measures the energy loss profile of the shower in the air which can be integrated to yield the total energy of the cosmic ray. The surface detector consists of a ground array of particle detectors which sample the lateral shower profile on the ground. This study focuses on the event class of very inclined air showers with zenith angles larger than 60 degrees. The lateral ground profile of these showers is muon dominated and not radially symmetric around the shower axis due to geomagnetic deflections and other effects. The dependency of this profile on the direction, energy and mass of the cosmic ray is discussed with a mixture of detailed Monte-Carlo simulations and a simplified analytical model of the air shower cascade. It is found in agreement with other studies that the normalized shape of the muon density profile is approximately universal over the range of cosmic ray energies and masses measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory, that the amplitude of the profile is almost proportional to the cosmic ray energy, and that its shower-to-shower fluctuations are sensitive to the mass composition of the cosmic rays. The reconstruction of the cosmic ray properties is based on the theoretical discussion. The angular reconstruction uses the measured signal arrival times in the surface detector. The shower direction is reconstructed by fitting a model of a spherical shower front to these arrival times ...",

            "abstract": "Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4) are closely related viruses that have important differences in the key molecular aspects of infection. EHV-1 unlike EHV-4, can induce signaling cascade inside the host cell following gH-integrin interaction, that leads to exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and is required for fusion at the plasma membrane. To evaluate what role exposure of PS to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane plays in case of EHV-1 infection we investigated what effects lipids with positive, natural or negative charge had on EHV-1 infection in cell culture. We found that liposomes containing negatively charged PS or positively charged DOTAP inhibited EHV-1 infection, while neutral phosphatidylcholine (PC) had no effect. Inhibition of infection with PS was dose dependent, decreased with time, and transient. Reduction in infection can be attributed to the interaction between the lipid vesicles and the virus particle itself. The strong virus interaction was identified with both DOTAP and PS, as measured with microscopy with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as well as Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of EHV-1 interactions with model membrane composed of neutral, cationic, or anionic phospholipids, in both cases interaction with cationic DOTAP was stronger that with PS. This suggests that PS induced inhibition of infection is more specific, than that of DOTAP. Perhaps PS inhibition is mediated through specific interaction with viral glycoproteins gH/gL and gB, while DOTAP can act in a less specific manner, by surrounding and shielding the viral particle. Small GTPases are ubiquitous signaling proteins, that could be activated downstream of EHV-1 induced calcium release. To investigate whether small GTPases play role in EHV-1 infection we infected cell treated with small GTPase inhibitors, we found that activation of small GTPases is required for EHV-1 infection at the post entry ...",

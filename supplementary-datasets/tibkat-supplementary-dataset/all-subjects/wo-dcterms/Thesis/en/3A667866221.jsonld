            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum and intensity of helminth infections, as well as to estimate seasonal effects on the prevalence and burden of helminths in organic free range layers in Germany. Furthermore, resistance of six common commercial laying hen strains to an experimental Ascaridia galli infection was compared. In a next step genetic parameters of resistance to a natural mixed infection under field condition were estimated for two commercial breeds. The experiments were conducted between 2007 and 2010 at the Department of Animal Sciences and on a commercial laying hen farm. For the first trail (chapter II), laying hens from organic free range farms were collected between 2007 and 2010. The hens were sacrified and the gastrointestinal tracts were examined for the presence and intensity of helminth infections with standard methods. Hens slaughtered from October to March were included in winter data, whereas hens slaughtered from April to September were included in summer data sets. Almost all hens harboured at least one worm of one helminth species. Average worm burden per hen was 218.4 worms. The most prevalent species were the nematodes Heterakis gallinarum (98 %) followed by Ascaridia gali (88 %) and Capillaria spp. (75.3 %), whereas the overall prevalence of the cestodes was 24.9 %. Total worm burden was significantly higher during the summer season when compared with animals slaughtered during winter season. Risk of being infected with any of the nematodes was higher in summer than in winter ...",

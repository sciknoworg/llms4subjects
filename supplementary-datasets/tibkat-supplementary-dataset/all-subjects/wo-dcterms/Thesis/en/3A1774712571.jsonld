            "abstract": "The characterization of exoplanets applying high-resolution transmission spectroscopy ini- tiated a new era making it possible to trace atmospheric signature at high altitudes in exoplanet atmospheres and to determine atmospheric properties which enrich our under- standing of the formation and evolution of the solar system. In contrast to what is observed in our solar system, where gaseous planets orbit at wide orbits, Jupiter type exoplanets were detected in foreign stellar systems surrounding their host stars within few days, in close orbits, the so called hot- and ultra-hot Jupiters. The most well studied ones are HD209458b and HD189733b, which are the first exoplanets where absorption is detected in their atmospheres, namely from the alkali line sodium. For hot Jupiters, the resonant alkali lines are the atmospheric species with one of the strongest absorption signatures, due to their large absorption cross-section. However, al- though the alkali lines sodium and potassium were detected in low-resolution observations for various giant exoplanets, potassium was absent in different high-resolution investiga- tions in contrast to sodium. The reason for this is quite puzzling, since both alkalis have very similar physical and chemical properties (e.g. condensation and ionization proper- ties). [...]",

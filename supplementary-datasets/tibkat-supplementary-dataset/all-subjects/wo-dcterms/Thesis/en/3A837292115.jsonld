            "abstract": "Mineral raw materials, supply chain, mining industry, sourcing process, extraction process, exploration process, modeling, SCOR model, DCOR model. - The mining industry is essential for manufacturing because it provides the basic materials for the related value-adding processes. Deep integration of the mining industry is, however, still an exception rather than a rule. This industry and its processes differ greatly from the processes of an average manufacturing company. This is because we cannot have directly comparable results in the absence of applications of standardized modeling tools for supply chains such as the SCOR model. These circumstances hinder the integration and understanding of, and exchange between, industries relying significantly on each other. The research problem of this thesis is set in the early supply chain processes of the mining industry; it focuses on the modeling of such processes with the goal of standardizing them and improving the integration as well as the performance of this industry in the supply chain. The modeling is based on the adaptation of the integrated supply chain frameworks DCOR and SCOR to the mining industry.",

            "title": "The MYCN oncogene as a minimal residual disease marker and therapeutic target in neuroblastoma",
            "abstract": "Neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid childhood cancer, arises from precursors of the developing sympathetic nervous system. MYCN oncogene amplification is a determinant of high risk and occurs in ~25% of neuroblastomas. Despite intensive treatment, more than half these patients succumb to their disease, implying persistence of therapy-resistant MYCN-amplified minimal residual neuroblastoma cells. This thesis proposes a comprehensive concept for the specific diagnostic detection of the MYCN amplicon and evaluates new treatment options for MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Disease-relevant nucleotide changes, structural gene rearrangements and copy number alterations were detected in tumor material by next-generation sequencing of a customized hybrid capture-based targeted panel. Unique MYCN amplicon breakpoints in the rearranged gene constitute a target sequence for a personalized minimal residual disease (MRD) PCR diagnostic. MYCN amplicon breakpoints in neuroblastoma cell lines and tumors were identified and recovered by individual, semi-quantitative PCR assays and Sanger sequencing. The assay was further developed for highly sensitive, real-time quantitative and droplet digital PCR detection for selected MYCN breakpoints in cell lines. MRD level detected in bone marrow aspirates collected during therapy outlined different disease courses in patients, including MRD persistence until relapse and good response to the first treatment course. Combining multi-agent chemotherapy in current high-risk protocols with indirect MYCN inhibitors provides a potential route to improve poor cure rates for MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas. Different hyperactive biological networks in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma were tackled using small molecule inhibitors of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) domain-containing protein BRD4, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). BET (JQ1, OTX015 and TEN-010) and kinase (alpelisib, volasertib and rigosertib) inhibitors demonstrated anti-cancer activity by ...",

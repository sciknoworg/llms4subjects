            "abstract": "Abstract: The impact of uncertainty on the decision-making of economic agents, such as firms and households, is a important but often neglected element of micro- and macroeconomic theory. With the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 and the strong increase in uncertainty that accompanied it, the theoretical analysis of this phenomenon has become more important.<br><br>With the article `The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks', published in 2009, Nicholas Bloom introduced a new facet to the debate surrounding the macroeconomic consequences of uncertainty: the question of what role uncertainty-induced 'real option values' in investment decisions play with regard to business cycle fluctuations.<br><br>However, the inclusion of real option values in macroeconomic models raises questions that go beyond the effects of uncertainty on the business cycle. In particular, the implementation of specific stochastic processes as the basis of option value analysis, such as the widely used Brownian motion, requires a fundamental theoretical discussion regarding the modeling of uncertainty and its consequences in economic and growth models.<br><br>The aim of this dissertation is a comprehensive discussion and further development of the theoretical effects of uncertainty in macroeconomic models against the background of the theory of real option values, with a strong focus on the implications of stochastic diffusion processes. The first article examines the effects of uncertainty in the euro crisis. Within a partial investment model, two kinds of uncertainty are introduced: volatility and disaster risk. The article expands the literature by integrating a jump-diffusion process into an entry-exit framework for investment decisions. In addition, SVAR estimates are made for a new country data set on uncertainty.<br><br>The second article implements uncertainty and irreversibility in a growth model with monopolistic competition. The model integrates both micro- and macroeconomic uncertainty modeled as Brownian motions. The article provides a comprehensive picture of short- and long-term volatility effects. The third article expands the model with a jump-diffusion process to investigate the influence of uncertainty in a development-economic context. The paper expands the literature in the field of development economics with a model that illustrates the effects of different uncertainty shocks on the development process. In the fourth article, the model developed in the second article  ...",

            "title": "Inversion of seismic source parameters for weak mining-induced and natural earthquakes",
            "abstract": "The purpose of this thesis is to develop an automated inversion scheme to derive point and finite source parameters for weak earthquakes, here intended with the unusual meaning of earthquakes with magnitudes at the limit or below the bottom magnitude threshold of standard source inversion routines. The adopted inversion approaches entirely rely on existing inversion software, the methodological work mostly targeting the development and tuning of optimized inversion flows. The resulting inversion scheme is tested for very different datasets, and thus allows the discussion on the source inversion problem at different scales. In the first application, dealing with mining induced seismicity, the source parameters determination is addressed at a local scale, with source-sensor distance of less than 3 km. In this context, weak seismicity corresponds to event below magnitude MW 2.0, which are rarely target of automated source inversion routines. The second application considers a regional dataset, namely the aftershock sequence of the 2010 Maule earthquake (Chile), using broadband stations at regional distances, below 300 km. In this case, the magnitude range of the target aftershocks range down to MW 4.0. This dataset is here considered as a weak seismicity case, since the analysis of such moderate seismicity is generally investigated only by moment tensor inversion routines, with no attempt to resolve source duration or finite source parameters. In this work, automated multi-step inversion schemes are applied to both datasets with the aim of resolving point source parameters, both using double couple (DC) and full moment tensor (MT) models, source duration and finite source parameters. A major result of the analysis of weaker events is the increased size of resulting moment tensor catalogues, which interpretation may become not trivial. For this reason, a novel focal mechanism clustering approach is used to automatically classify focal mechanisms, allowing the investigation of the most relevant and repetitive rupture features. The inversion of the mining induced seismicity dataset reveals the repetitive occurrence of similar rupture processes, where the source geometry is controlled by the shape of the mined panel. Moreover, moment tensor solutions indicate a significant contribution of tensile processes. Also the second application highlights some characteristic geometrical features of the fault planes, which show a general consistency with the orientation of the slab. The additional inversion for source duration allowed to verify the empirical correlation for moment normalized earthquakes in subduction zones among a decreasing rupture duration with increasing source depth, which was so far only observed for larger events.",

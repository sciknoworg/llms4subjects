            "abstract": "ADHD, Adults, Medication. - Background: Over the last years, there has been an increasing recognition of the persistence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) into adulthood. ADHD was once perceived to be exclusively a childhood disorder. Objective: The aim of the study is to give an overview on diagnosis and prescription prevalence for ADHD in 17 to 20 year old patients and their prescribing physicians. Methods: A statutory health insurance companys' (Gmuender ErsatzKasse GEK) - person-specific but not identifying - prescription and diagnosis data for people aged 17 to 20 was analysed. The analysis was done in a longitudinal section design from 2004 to 2007 and then in a cross sectional design for each year from 2004 to 2007. Especially for the year 2007, data concerning people with and without ADHD diagnosis were compared with regard to some selected diagnoses und prescriptions. Results: The results of the longitudinal section study show that 24% of the young people with an ADHD diagnosis (ICD-10, F90-, Hyperkinetic Disorder) in the year 2004 kept this diagnosis until 2007. The proportion of men to women is 5:1. The results of the cross section study, conducted for every year from 2004 to 2007, show that the ratio of persons with ADHD diagnosis rose from 0.69% in 2004 to 1.4% in 2007. People with ADHD diagnosis get more prescriptions and comorbidity diagnoses than people without ADHD. They often change the attending physician - that points to a problem of transitional care at the transition from youth to adulthood. Conclusion: The ratio for people aged 17 to 20 years with an ADHD diagnosis rose in the observed period. These patients need a medical contact with special knowledge about ADHD for leading them through the time of transition from youth to adulthood.",

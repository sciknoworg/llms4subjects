                "Introduction -- Four Gods as a Dual Symbol: Apotropaic and Political Significance -- Re-examining the Establishment of the Tomb Guardian Beasts, and the Iconography of the Four Gods -- Meaning and Function of the Assemblages of the Supernatural Figurines -- Use and Circulation of Four Gods -- Disappearance of Four Gods and New Perceptions Related to Apotropaic Practices in Tombs -- Conclusion.",
                "This book employs a biographical approach to comprehensively study a set of Tang era-tomb guardian figurines, known as the Four Gods (Sishen), comprising a pair of warriors (Dangkuang and Dangye) and a pair of hybrid beasts (Zuming and Dizhou). These objects were exclusively used by officials until 841 AD and were mainly found in capitals then. They disappeared in the 9th century AD. The book is divided into three sections. Part one focuses on their symbolism through names, images, burial contexts, associated ritual regulations, and the interplay of all of these, revealing their dual significance \u2013 apotropaic and political, tied to ritual propriety, nuo exorcism, yin-yang divination, and more. Part two explores their connection to other supernatural tomb figurines in the early and middle Tang periods, challenging previous theories and highlighting regional standardization. Additionally, this part delves into the Four Gods\u2019 regulated production, government oversight, and role in funerary processions. Part three examines their disappearance due to shifting views on the afterlife and diminishing national power. It also explores changes in the usage of related tomb objects after the Tang era, focusing on protective functions and spatial concepts. About the author Lok Man Yang studied East Asian Art History, Archaeology, and Anthropology in Heidelberg (Germany), Glasgow and Hong Kong. Her main area of interest is the study of object symbolism of Chinese funerary and ritual artifacts. She has been involved in curating exhibitions on ancient Chinese artifacts."

                "\u2018This book should be compulsory reading for every European politician, student and scholar. It vividly and effectively displays how the European Union entered the domestic politics of member states by reshaping party systems, party preferences, and strategies after multiple profound crises.\u2019 \u2014Leonardo Morlino, Emeritus Professor of Political Science, Luiss G. Carli, Italy, and Former President of the International Political Science Association \u2018Congratulations to the author on a fascinating and novel data analysis, and a provocative discussion of an interesting and important topic. The fact that EU voter-party proximity has become more important for voting behaviour and that committed pro-Europeans strike back by mobilising in support of the more Europhile parties are the latest discoveries in EU politicisation studies.\u2019 \u2014Nicol\u00f2 Conti, Professor of Political Science, Unitelma Sapienza University of Rome, Italy This book analyses emerging trends in the politicisation of EU conflicts in Western Europe between 2006 and 2019, evaluating the transformative effects arising from multiple crises \u2013 the Euro crisis, the migration crisis and the Brexit Referendum. It describes how EU issues have been increasingly emphasised and polarised by various political parties \u2013 both the mainstream pro-EU and anti-EU protest parties \u2013 and have been transformed into more meaningful determinants of voting. The respective chapters investigate the fluctuations in EU issue entrepreneurship and EU issue voting, identifying which party types have been more likely to benefit from their EU issue proximity to voters, and assessing the growing politicisation of the EU conflict in both South European and North-Western countries. This book will be of particular interest to students and scholars of political parties, European politics, Euroscepticism and voting behaviour. Luca Carrieri is a researcher at Luiss Guido Carli University, Rome. A member of the Italian Centre for Electoral Studies (CISE), his current research interests include elections, political parties and EU politics.",

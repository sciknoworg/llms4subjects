            "abstract": "In presynaptic nerve endings, exocytosis of synaptic vesicles is restricted to specialized areas of the plasma membrane, called active zones, that are distinguished by electron-dense material. Here synaptic vesicles attach to the release sites (docking) and are then activated (priming) before undergoing calcium-dependent exocytosis, releasing their neurotransmitter content into the synaptic cleft. Many of the key players of the presynaptic exocytotic machinery are known, and also the major scaffold proteins of the active zone have been identified. However, the precise molecular composition of the sites at which vesicles dock remains to be elucidated. Proteomic approaches to identify protein components of these sites are challenging because of difficulties in purifying these sites. Most importantly it has been very difficult to separate presynaptic membranes from postsynaptic membranes and the postsynaptic protein scaffold. Here we report about a new procedure allowing for an almost quantitative separation of pre- and postsynaptic membrane fractions. The procedure involves mild proteolysis resulting in the cleavage of the adhesion molecules connecting pre- and postsynaptic membranes, followed by gradient centrifugation, lysis of the presynaptic compartment, separation of free and docked vesicles, and immunoisolation using antibodies specific for synaptic vesicle proteins as the final purification step. Using quantitative proteomics we then compared the protein composition of free and docked vesicles. In the latter fraction we detected all major active zone proteins ...",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms take a large influence on ecological and symbiotic interactions in long-term relationships that are moderated by secondary metabolites with often-unique structure and biological activity. Different habitats influence the development of the secondary metabolites produced by bacteria. Marine microorganisms, particularly bacteria, have provided new incentives for investigating marine natural products over the past few years, and also continue to be the subject of vigorous chemical investigation. This highlights their importance as a source of natural products. So, the search for new biologically active natural metabolites in bacteria may enable us to cure unusual drug resistances and infectious diseases. In the present study, five terrestrial Streptomycetes and six other marine-derived bacterial strains were selected on the basis of a chemical and biological screening. These strains were subjected to culture optimisation, working up and isolation of their metabolites. From their extracts, 67 compounds were isolated, among them 26 were new. Of the latter, 14 were isolated from marine Streptomyces spp., six new compounds were obtained from terrestrial Streptomyces. spp. The remaining six compounds were known from syntheses, but were isolated here for the first time from nature. From a series of 15 indole derivatives, 7 were new. Trisindolal, an indolecarb-aldehyde, proved to be active with an overall potency of 0.45 \u00e6g/ml (mean IC50 value against 11 tumor cell lines). The indole structures invite innovative approaches to explore them as potential leads in drug discovery as kinase inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "Insects are segmented organisms but the number of segments contributing to the head is disputed. The most anterior head region is patterned differently from the rest of the body and, therefore, is considered to be non-segmental. During embryogenesis, the non-segmental region can be subdivided into an outer neurogenic region and an inner triangular part which is mostly free of neurogenic precursor cells. Due to the similarities with a structure known from embryonic development of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster (MEIGEN, 1830), this median region will be referred to as the clypeolabral region (CLR). It gives rise to the larval clypeolabrum and comprises the anlagen of the anterior gut and the stomatogastric nervous system. The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (HERBST, 1797) has been established as an important model organism for insect head development due to its insect-typical head and its amenability to functional studies. The formation of the CLR in Tribolium involves a previously unnoticed connection between mesodermal cells and the extraembryonic amnion as well as the formation of a fold in the anterior head. The anterior fold separates the ectoderm of both head sides during early embryogenesis and apparently accounts for the generation of the lateral head lobes found in insect embryos ...",

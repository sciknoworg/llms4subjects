            "abstract": "Currently favoured cosmological models for structure formation of the Universe assume that a large fraction of the mass of the Universe is 'dark'. The evidence for dark matter comes from observations of its gravitational influence. Examples such as the flatness of rotation curves of spiral galaxies or the large velocities of galaxies in galaxy clusters are thought to be manifestations of its presence. Gravitational lensing can now also be used to map the dark matter distribution of the Universe. Despite the fact that the evidence for dark matter has existed for more than 75 years, it is still not clear what dark matter is made of. Particle physics provides some interesting and well-motivated candidates, but the elusive dark matter particles have not yet been detected. Therefore, the hunt for dark matter is one of the major joint efforts of cosmology and particle physics. The only way to prove the dark matter hypothesis is the direct detection of dark matter particles in a laboratory. Experiments exploit various techniques to detect dark matter particles. All of these experiments require as input the phase-space distribution of dark matter. This means they require information on the configuration-space and velocity-space distributions. These insights can only come from cosmology and the theory of structure formation in the Universe. The goal of this thesis is to predict the expected dark matter phase-space distribution near the solar system and in the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. A large part of this thesis is dedicated to a detailed analysis of the coarse-grained dark matter distribution near the Sun based on the Aquarius project, the currently largest set of Milky Way-like dark matter halo simulations. Based on these simulations we predict the local dark matter density distribution to be remarkably smooth: the density at the Sun differs from the mean over a best-fit ellipsoidal equidensity contour by less than 15% at the 99.9% confidence level. The local velocity distribution is also very smooth, but it differs systematically from a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution ...",

            "abstract": "Since the early twentieth century, different general laws have been investigated to understand mechanisms driving stability in natural ecosystems, but until today the mechanisms are still generally unexplored. The main goal for ecology is to understand mechanisms driving food web dynamics, to counteract the hazard of global species loss. The studies presented in this thesis investigate the general scaling of different strucural food web (e.g. diversity, connectance, vulnerabilty) and species properties (e.g. body mass, trophic level), and how these properties in?uence secondary extinctions in food webs. The backbone of this thesis is a database of food webs , including information about predatorprey interactions, the metabolic type, and the species&rsquo; body mass. The relationship between diversity and topology is widely discussed, especially the hypothesis that a constant number of species per link leads to a decreasing connectance with increasing number of species. The alternative to this idea has been the &rsquo;constant connectance hypothesis&rsquo;, where connectance is constant with increasing number of species. As part of my thesis (Chapter 2), I analysed the scaling of topological properties based on my compiled database and found powerlaw scaling relationships with diversity and complexity for most properties. Also, connectance tends to decrease with increasing number of species ...",

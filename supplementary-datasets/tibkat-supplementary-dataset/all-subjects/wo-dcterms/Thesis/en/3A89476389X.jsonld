            "abstract": "This research is on Human Capital Building in Benin. Recent literature indicates that educational and health care expansion do effectively contribute to output growth and upgraded living standards as the main support to build up a stock of human capital. This study review the cases of early childhood enrolment, access to health care and nutrition and the return on education investment. Increase in access to basic education, health care and nutrition can redistribute income faster than increase in lonely household income and might help in reducing income inequality. It also indicates that income increases with the level of education. The focus of this study is to analyze also the distribution of education and health care in Benin. These lower enrolments and lower access to health care and nutrition are marked with regional inequalities, urban, rural, gender and income biases. The distributional analysis indicates that primary and secondary school enrolment, use of health facilities and the consumption of balanced food are concentrated in the hand of rich households who are located in the urban areas. The study will conclude with recommendations.",

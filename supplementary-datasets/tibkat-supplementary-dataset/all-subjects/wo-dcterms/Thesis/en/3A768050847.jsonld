            "abstract": "Background: Increased numbers of intestinal E. coli are observed in inflammatory bowel disease, but the reasons for this proliferation and it exact role in intestinal inflammation are unknown. Aim of this PhD-project was to identify E. coli proteins involved in E. coli\u2019s adaptation to the inflammatory conditions in the gut and to investigate whether these factors affect the host. Furthermore, the molecular basis for strain-specific differences between probiotic and harmful E. coli in their response to intestinal inflammation was investigated. Methods: Using mice monoassociated either with the adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) strain UNC or the probiotic E. coli Nissle, two different mouse models of intestinal inflammation were analysed: On the one hand, severe inflammation was induced by treating mice with 3.5% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). On the other hand, a very mild intestinal inflammation was generated by associating interleukin 10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice with E. coli. Differentially expressed proteins in the E. coli strains collected from caecal contents of these mice were identified by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis. Results DSS-experiment: All DSS-treated mice revealed signs of a moderate caecal and a severe colonic inflammation. However, mice monoassociated with E. coli Nissle were less affected. In both E. coli strains, acute inflammation led to a downregulation of pathways involved in carbohydrate breakdown and energy generation. Accordingly, DSS-treated mice had lower caecal concentrations of bacterial fermentation products than the control mice. Differentially expressed proteins also included the Fe-S cluster repair protein NfuA, the tryptophanase TnaA, and the uncharacterised protein YggE. NfuA was upregulated nearly 3-fold in both E. coli strains after DSS administration. Reactive oxygen species produced during intestinal inflammation damage Fe-S clusters and thereby lead to an inactivation of Fe-S proteins. In vitro data indicated that the repair of Fe-S proteins by NfuA is a central mechanism in E. coli to survive oxidative stress. Expression of YggE, which has been reported to reduce the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, was 4- to 8-fold higher in E. coli Nissle than in E. coli UNC under control and inflammatory conditions. In vitro growth experiments confirmed these results, indicating that E. coli Nissle is better equipped to cope with oxidative stress than E. coli UNC. Additionally, E. coli Nissle isolated from DSS-treated and control mice had TnaA levels 4- to 7-fold higher than E. coli UNC. In turn, caecal indole concentrations resulting from cleavage of tryptophan by TnaA were higher in E. coli Nissle- associated control mice than in the respective mice associated with E. coli UNC. Because of its anti-inflammatory effect, indole is hypothesised to be involved in the extension of the remission phase in ulcerative colitis described for E. coli Nissle. Results IL-10-/--experiment: Only IL-10-/- mice monoassociated with E. coli UNC for 8 weeks exhibited signs of a very mild caecal inflammation. In agreement with this weak inflammation, the variations in the bacterial proteome were small. Similar to the DSS-experiment, proteins downregulated by inflammation belong mainly to the central energy metabolism. In contrast to the DSS-experiment, no upregulation of chaperone proteins and NfuA were observed, indicating that these are strategies to overcome adverse effects of strong intestinal inflammation. The inhibitor of vertebrate C-type lysozyme, Ivy, was 2- to 3-fold upregulated on mRNA and protein level in E. coli Nissle in comparison to E. coli UNC isolated from IL-10-/- mice. By overexpressing ivy, it was demonstrated in vitro that Ivy contributes to a higher lysozyme resistance observed for E. coli Nissle, supporting the role of Ivy as a potential fitness factor in this E. coli strain. Conclusions: The results of this PhD-study demonstrate that intestinal bacteria sense even minimal changes in the health status of the host. While some bacterial adaptations to the inflammatory conditions are equal in response to strong and mild intestinal inflammation, other reactions are unique to a specific disease state. In addition, probiotic and colitogenic E. coli differ in their response to the intestinal inflammation and thereby may influence the host in different ways.",

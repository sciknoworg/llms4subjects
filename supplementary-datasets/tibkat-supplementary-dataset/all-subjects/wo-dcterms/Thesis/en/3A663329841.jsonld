            "abstract": "The aims of this study were to determine the underlying causes of male infertility, growth retardation and cardiac hypertrophy in Hspa4-/- mice. In order to identify the spermatogenic stage, at which spermatogenesis is affected by Hspas4 deficiency in mice with hybrid C57BL/6J x 129/Sv genetic background, we performed histological and immunological analysis. Analysis of germ cell development during juvenile life of Hspa4-/- mice showed an arrest of first wave of spermatogenesis in late stage of prophase I. RNA analysis showed a marked reduction in expression of late meiotic and postmeiotic-specific marker genes, whereas expression of early meiotic-specific genes was unaffected in the Hspa4-/- testes. These results suggest that HSPA4 is required for the regulation of diverse chaperone processes and cell cycle during germ cell progression. The second aim of this study was concentrated to study the cause of growth retardation in Hspa4-/- mice with inbred 129/Sv genetic background. To investigate whether growth retardation is due to skeletal muscle myopathy, histological analyses of different skeletal muscles were carried out. Histological analyses revealed that Tibialis anterior, Vastus intermedius, Soleus and paraspinal muscles of Hspa4-/- adult mice displayed myopathic changes. Moreover, myopathic change was already present at an early postnatal stage of Hspa4 -/- mice development. This suggested that skeletal muscle myopathy is the cause of growth retardation. Furthermore, these results suggest that HSPA4 has protective effect that confers the protection of skeletal muscle against mechanical or metabolic stress, which induce skeletal muscle degradation ...",

            "abstract": "The thesis deals with the stochastic description of models motivated from the point of view of semi-flexible polymers. These are chain-like molecules build up from small molecular units (monomers) and, depending on the length-scale, displaying different flexibility properties. In particular, we are interested in the behavior of such a polymer chain in the proximity of an attractive environment, e.g. a membrane. An important question in this situation is whether the polymer sticks close to the membrane (localization) or fluctuates away from it (delocalization). We consider a directed model of a polymer chain given by the spatial position of the i-th monomer in the d-dimensional space. The polymer is subject to an interaction with itself (semi-flexibility) as well as an interaction with the environment. The environment has an attractive effect and is represented by an m-dimensional subspace (reference plane). When touching the reference plane the polymer receives an energy-reward in the form of a pinning parameter. The interaction among individual monomers is represented by a mixture of gradient and Laplacian interaction with different interaction potentials. We call this model the pinning model and study particularly the localization behavior of the polymer in proximity of a reference plane. That means, we ask if a phase transition occurs by modifying the pinning parameter. In this case we would have a critical pinning value, such that above this value the polymer chain has a positive contact fraction at the reference plane (localization). On the other hand it would not be the case for a pinning parameter below the critical value (delocalization). This behavior additionally depends on the choice of the interaction potentials ...",

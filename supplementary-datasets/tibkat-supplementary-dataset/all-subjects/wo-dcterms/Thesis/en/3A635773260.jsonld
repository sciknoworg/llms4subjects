            "abstract": "Branched flow is a universal phenomenon of two-dimensional wave or particle flows which propagate through a weak random potential. Its origin is the formation of caustics, which are locations where the flow is focused by the cumulative effect of weak random forces acting along the flowpath. Branched flow has been observed on length scales spanning at least twelve orders of magnitude and in a variety of systems. For example, it has been studied in semiconductor microdevices, has been argued to be the mechanism underlying the formation of giant freak sea waves and has been predicted for the propagation of sound through the ocean on scales of several thousands of kilometers. A thorough understanding of the mechanism dictating how a random potential can cause such drastic effects such as branching is therefore important in many areas of physics, and is interesting to experimentalists and theoreticians alike ...",

            "abstract": "Subacute rumen acidosis is a common disorder in cattle. At the beginning of lactation and during the finishing period, the energy need of dairy and beef cattle significantly increases. This energy demand is met by an intense concentrate supply. Concentrates provide a great amount of easily fermentable carbohydrates, which are degraded into short chain fatty acids (SCFA) by the microbial community in the rumen. The accumulation of SCFA leads to a decrease in ruminal pH. Subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) occurs, when the acid accumulation exceeds the ruminal absorption and buffering capacity and the pH decreases below physiological thresholds. During SARA conditions, the degradation of organic matter is impaired and the SCFA pattern changes due to alterations in the microbial community. Mostly, affected animals appear with mild unspecific symptoms, such as a reduced feed intake, diarrhea, and a decreased milk fat production. The rumen acidosis is a widely spread problem, which affects animal wellbeing and has a great financial impact on the farmer. Therefore, rumen acidosis has been a major topic in research for the past decades. This study aimed to establish an in vitro model to mimic subacute rumen acidosis under laboratory conditions. In the present study, we observed the impact of SARA in the Rusitec system on the fermentation pattern and the bacterial community. Moreover, we observed the recovery process of the fermentation pattern and the ability of the bacterial community to regenerate from SARA within the microbial community. The experimental trials consisted of an initial equilibration period, followed by a first control period, the acidosis challenge, and a second control period for regeneration. During the acidosis period, we induced low pH values by reducing the buffer capacity of the artificial saliva and by variations in the concentrate supply. Two acidosis buffers were each combined with three feeding groups, with differing roughage-to-concentrate ratios. The infusion of either one of the acidosis buffer solutions lead to an immediate decrease in pH, which subsequently turned into a steady state. A sudden increase of concentrate, however, did not affect the pH value in the Rusitec. After acidosis induction, the total SCFA and acetate production decreased. This was reflected in a diminished diversity of the bacterial community and a reduced abundance of fibrolytic bacteria. During the acidosis period, the lactate concentration slightly increased, which was presumably linked to an increase of lactate producing and utilizing bacteria. The feed alterations among groups had an impact on the NH3-N and acetate concentration in the Rusitec vessels. When the regeneration period was induced, the pH immediately increased. This was accompanied with a recovery of most of the analyzed biochemical and microbial parameters. With the present study we proved, that fermentation parameters and the bacterial population are able to recover from SARA in the Rusitec system. Therefore, this in vitro approach successfully provides a model, which is able to mimic the bacterial and fermentative variations during and after acidotic bouts. As in vivo SARA occurs repetitively, it would be of great interest to perform a second acidosis period in future studies, and observe the impact on the microbial community during and after recurrent acidotic challenges. This model may be used to test feed additives and acidosis prevention strategies and can contribute to further primary research whilst reducing reliance on live animal research models.",

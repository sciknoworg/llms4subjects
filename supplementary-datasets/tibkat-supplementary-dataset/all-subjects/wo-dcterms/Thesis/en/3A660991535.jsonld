            "abstract": "One of the most important questions in astronomy is unanswered since the beginning of astrophysics: How do stars form? While a coarse picture emerged within the last century, the details are still vague and often controversially debated. We now know that stars form only in the densest parts of galaxies, where hydrogen is mostly in its molecular form. The temperature in these regions is low enough to allow gravity to overcome all other stabilizing forces so that a gravitational collapse can happen. The \"birth\" of a star itself is not readily observable as the natal core from which the star forms absorbs most visible and even infrared light. One of the earliest signs of new stars are their jets which escape the core and which are often easier to observe than the protostar itself. Understanding the various processes involved in star formation and stellar evolution requires a multi-wavelength effort. A complete picture will only emerge by combining results from various energy ranges including the X-ray emission from protostars and their jets. X-rays often trace the high energy end of the available spectrum and are associated with some kind of magnetic field. X-ray emission from protostars directly requires at least a small scale magnetic field while the X-ray emission from protostellar jets indirectly requires a large scale magnetic field for the generation of the jets themselves. My thesis deals with both kinds of X-ray emission as described in the following...",

            "title": "Optimised Storage Extension and Utilisation for the Future German Power System",
            "abstract": "The provision of flexibility is vital in power systems shaped by weather-dependent renewable energy generation. While today power system flexibility in Germany is provided by still existing large scale thermal power plants, storage units will have to take over with rising renewable shares. This thesis aims to analyse the required stor- age units regarding their central characteristics. A high-resolution model of the future German power system allows an in-depth optimisation and assessment of the sizing and siting of optimal storage units. The open-source model is strictly based on open data. Demand and power grid infrastructure are kept constant at today\u2019s levels, while two future scenarios define the power generation portfolio. Under the assumption of significant wind power feed-in in Northern Germany, it is found that storage capacity is mainly required in the North and Northwest of the country. Offshore wind grid connection points trigger the installation of storage units. Bottlenecks in the power grid are another significant driver for storage. Hence, weak North-South transmission capacities lead to more storage in the North. Cross-border power exchange is highly beneficial for renewable power systems and may substantially decrease storage re- quirements in Germany",

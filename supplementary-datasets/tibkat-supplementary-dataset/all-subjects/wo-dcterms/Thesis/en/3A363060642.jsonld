            "abstract": "In the past, the influence of the mothers\u00b4 educational and occupational statuses on children\u00b4s status attainment has been widely ignored in studies on social stratification. Usually only the father\u00b4s socioeconomic status is used to indicate a family\u00b4s socioeconomic position, because it is assumed that he holds the dominant status position in the household. As overall educational levels are rising and mothers\u00b4 labour market participation is steadily increasing, this assumption no longer holds. How does the mother\u00b4s educational and occupational status influence the education and occupational status of her children? How has her influence developed in the last couple of decades? Her education and her occupational status are significantly related to the educational level of sons and daughters. Regarding occupational status reproduction, the mother\u00b4s status resources are only important for the daughter\u00b4s occupational attainment. The mother\u00b4s socioeconomic resources always have been important for the transfer of status advantages from one generation to the next, now as well as in the past. Over the years, though, her influence has decreased in essentially the same way as has the father\u00b4s influence.",

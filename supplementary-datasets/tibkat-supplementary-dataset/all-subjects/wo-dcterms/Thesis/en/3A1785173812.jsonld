            "abstract": "CD8+ T cells represent an essential component of anti-tumor immune responses by mediating direct cytotoxicity against neoplastic cells as well as by providing immunological memory. The activation of CD8+ T cells by tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens results in their rapid expansion and differentiation into effector cytotoxic cells (CTL). Once target tumor cells are eradicated, the population of effector CTLs contracts and leaves behind a small population of long-lived memory cells. However, the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment and sustained antigen exposure commonly drive tumor-infiltrating CTLs into a hypo-responsive and so called exhausted\" state which is characterized by defective cytotoxicity and impaired production of anti-neoplastic cytokines such as TNF\uf061 and IFN\uf067. This exhausted phenotype of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells is furthermore marked by an increased expression of co-inhibitory molecules such as PD-1 and Tim-3, which deter the activation and function of CD8+ T cells contributing to the immune evasion of tumor cells. The exhaustion of tumor-specific T cells thereby not only affects endogenous CD8+ T cells but also compromises the success of immunotherapies such as the adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cell or CAR T cell therapies as transferred T cells become frequently exhausted and dysfunctional. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the molecular regulators of CD8+ T cell function and exhaustion to overcome the limitations of current CD8+ T cell-based immunotherapies. Similarly, we believe that a better characterization of new molecular regulators of CD8+ T cell exhaustion will allow to develop more potent immunotherapies against human tumors that are so far not sufficiently treated by current adoptive T cell therapies. HDACs are among the key epigenetic orchestrators of gene regulation. They catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histone tails resulting in chromatin condensation and suppression of gene expression. As a class IIa HDAC, HDAC7 can shuttle from ...\"",

            "abstract": "Climate change is advancing inexorably and is en route to cause uncontrollable global warming that will go along with self-amplifying feedback loops and disastrous cascading effects. At the same time is the global energy consumption further increasing, meaning decisive action to prevent the worst from happening needs to be taken that essentially include a rapid expansion of renewable energy sources. Sustainable and well-performing PV-based technologies like c-Si, CdTe and CIGSe are already existing but none of these are considered a meaningful candidate for substantial large-scale installations owing to virtually counterproductive energy payback times (c-Si), or severe toxicity and scarcity of their constituents (CdTe, CIGSe). With kesterite-type CZTSSe an alternative PV material class did emerge that can essentially be composed of abundantly available and non-toxic elements but several performance limiting factors need to be tackled prior to application maturity. Improvements are not exclusively aiming at reducing the gap towards the Shockley-Queisser limit [1] but also include a diversification of its application. The substitution of tin with germanium leads to a widening of the band gap and thus to new applications, yet little knowledge existed regarding structural trends in CZGSe and how they relate to its material's properties. In order to shed more light on structural characteristics solid-state reaction was applied to synthesize off-stoichiometric CZGSe powder samples [2-4]. The composition and chemical homogeneity were examined by quantitative WDX spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy was employed to estimate the band gap energy [5]. Rietveld analysis [6, 7] and the average neutron scattering length method [8, 9] were applied both to p-XRD and p-ND data for a comprehensive structural characterization. The majority of the samples exhibited a sufficient chemical homogeneity of the CZGSe phase allowing for a meaningful investigation, albeit oftentimes co-existing with secondary phases. Careful structure ...",

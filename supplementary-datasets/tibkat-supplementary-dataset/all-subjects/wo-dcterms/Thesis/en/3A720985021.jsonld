            "abstract": "Taking advantage of ATRP and using functionalized initiators, different functionalities were introduced in both \u03b1 and \u03c9 chain-ends of synthetic polymers. These functionalized polymers could then go through modular synthetic pathways such as click cycloaddition (copper-catalyzed or copper-free) or amidation to couple synthetic polymers to other synthetic polymers, biomolecules or silica monoliths. Using this general strategy and designing these co/polymers so that they are thermoresponsive, yet bioinert and biocompatible with adjustable cloud point values (as it is the case in the present thesis), the whole generated system becomes \"smart\" and potentially applicable in different branches. The applications which were considered in the present thesis were in polymer post-functionalization (in situ functionalization of micellar aggregates with low and high molecular weight molecules), hydrophilic/hydrophobic tuning, chromatography and bioconjugation (enzyme thermoprecipitation and recovery, improvement of enzyme activity). Different \u03b1-functionalized co/polymers containing cholesterol moiety, aldehyde, t-Boc protected amine, TMS-protected alkyne and NHS-activated ester were designed and synthesized in this work.",

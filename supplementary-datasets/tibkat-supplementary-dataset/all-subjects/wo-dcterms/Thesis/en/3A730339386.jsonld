            "abstract": "CD8+ T cell mediated antiviral response (CNAR) is associated with long-term control of HIV-infection and attributed to the secretion of an unknown factor called soluble CD8+ cell antiviral factor (CAF). In order to identify CAF, microarray data from CD8+ cells displaying high CNAR activity and CD8+ cells that lack CNAR were analyzed. Out of more than 50 differentially regulated genes, differential expression of 16 genes was validated by qRT-PCR in CD8 cells from 21 monkeys. FAM26F was identified as a sole candidate that was significantly differentially expressed in samples from SIV-infected as well as non-infected animals. FAM26F expression increased in CNAR- CD8+ T cells during their co-cultivation with SIV-infected CD4+ T cells in viral inhibition test. FAM26F was found to be expressed on three major blood cell populations (CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells). In vitro stimulation studies revealed that FAM26F expression was greatly induced in PBMCs after 6hrs of IFN-? stimulation, and to some extent by IFN-a. Next, the expression pattern of FAM26F before and after infection was investigated in two independent AIDS vaccine experiments comprising in total 42 monkeys. In both experiments, FAM26F expression along with other innate immune modulators was significantly increased in PBMCs and followed same in vivo expression pattern after infection as Mx1, IP-10 and tetherin after SIV-infection. Its expression was also found to be significantly correlated with Mx1, IP-10 and tetherin ...",

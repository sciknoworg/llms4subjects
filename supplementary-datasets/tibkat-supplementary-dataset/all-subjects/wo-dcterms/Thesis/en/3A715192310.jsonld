            "title": "Universal computation and memory by neural switching",
            "abstract": "Complex heteroclinic networks of connected saddle states persistently emerge in a broad range of dynamical systems and may reliably encode ``memory items'' as specific switching trajectories. Their computational capabilities, however, are far from being understood. To study their computation capabilities, we first derive the theoretical basis for computation by persistent switching processes. We present our approach to find and to characterize partially synchronized states, a complete analysis of the stability properties for these states, and show how information may be encoded by inducing limit cycles close to a heteroclinic network. Second, we introduce two different conceptual applications. We show how universal computation can be performed by exploiting heteroclinic cycles. We provid two examples of computation. The first consists of a two-bits bitwise computer composed of five oscillators capable of performing universal computation by encoding all basic logical operations (AND, OR, XOR); as a second example we present an autonomous agent exhibiting spatially distributed sensors that is capable of detecting and following a moving source field by calculation the field gradient. The second application consist of a novel model for artificial short-term memory that exploits perturbed heteroclinic connections in the presence of network asymmetries. As an actual example of short-term memory, we provide a network architecture to memorize pictures with six bits colored pixels. In summary we show that these systems are capable of computing with or without explicit memory by entering into switching sequences in a controlled way, thus offering a highly flexible new kind of computation based on a persistent switching principle.",

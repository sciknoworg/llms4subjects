            "abstract": "\u2018Heterosis\u2019 is a term used in genetics and breeding referring to hybrid vigour or the superiority of hybrids over their parents in terms of traits such as size, growth rate, biomass, fertility, yield, nutrient content, disease resistance or tolerance to abiotic and abiotic stress. Parental plants which are two different inbred (pure) lines that have desired traits are crossed to obtain hybrids. Maximum heterosis is observed in the first generation (F1) of crosses. Heterosis has been utilised in plant and animal breeding programs for at least 90 years: by the end of the 21st century, 65% of worldwide maize production was hybrid-based. Generally, it is believed that an understanding of the molecular basis of heterosis will allow the creation of new superior genotypes which could either be used directly as F1 hybrids or form the basis for the future breeding selection programmes. Two selected accessions of a research model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) were crossed to obtain hybrids. These typically exhibited a 60-80% increase of biomass when compared to the average weight of both parents. This PhD project focused on investigating the role of selected regulatory genes given their potentially key involvement in heterosis. In the first part of the project, the most appropriate developmental stage for this heterosis study was determined by metabolite level measurements and growth observations in parents and hybrids. At the selected stage, around 60 candidate regulatory genes (i.e. differentially expressed in hybrids when compared to parents) were identified. Of these, the majority were transcription factors, genes that coordinate the expression of other genes. Subsequent expression analyses of the candidate genes in biomass-heterotic hybrids of other Arabidopsis accessions revealed a differential expression in a gene subset, highlighting their relevance for heterosis. Moreover, a fraction of the candidate regulatory genes were found within DNA regions closely linked to the genes that underlie the biomass or growth heterosis. Additional analyses to validate the role of selected candidate regulatory genes in heterosis appeared insufficient to establish their role in heterosis. This uncovered a need for using novel approaches as discussed in the thesis. Taken together, the work provided an insight into studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis. Although studies on heterosis date back to more than one hundred years, this project as many others revealed that more investigations will be needed to uncover this phenomenon.",

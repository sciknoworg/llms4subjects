            "abstract": "The redox status describes the balance between oxidants and antioxidants and is essential for maintaining physiological processes. However, excessive radical production can lead to an imbalance, known as oxidative stress, which is involved in a variety of pathological changes associated with cancer or chronic inflammatory skin diseases. However, the role of oxidative stress in atopic dermatitis (AD) has not been elucidated so far and studies on the redox status in atopic skin are very limited. Since inflammatory reactions are associated with oxidative stress and the skin is constantly exposed to environmental factors, oxidative stress could play a role in atopic skin. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy offers the opportunity to get a comprehensive overview of the redox status in atopic skin and a deeper understanding of this topic. Therefore, different EPR-based approaches using redox active spin probes and a spin trap were established in different ex vivo and in vitro skin models to assess both the oxidative and antioxidative status in the skin. In the investigation of the oxidative status, the spin probe PCA was used to quantify the radical production and the spin trap DMPO was used to characterize the radical types. In addition, UVB-NIR radiation was used as an exogenous stress factor to investigate radiation-induced radical production in the skin and thus gaining information about the stress resistance. Furthermore, the spin probe TEMPO was used to investigate the antioxidative status, which gives information on the antioxidant capacity in the skin. The established EPR measurements showed differences in the redox status between the different skin models (ex vivo human, porcine, murine skin, in vitro skin equivalent), especially in the amount and type of radicals after UVB-NIR irradiation. Apart from the antioxidant capacity, TEMPO can also be used to obtain spatially resolved information of skin, since it can be distributed in both hydrophilic and lipophilic microenvironments.

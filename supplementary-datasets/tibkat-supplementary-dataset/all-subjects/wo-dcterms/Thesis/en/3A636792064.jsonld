            "abstract": "The main goal of this PhD thesis is to investigate some of the problems related to optimization of resources in environments with unpredictable behavior where: (i) not all information is available and (ii) the environment presents unknown temporal changes. The investigations in this PhD thesis are divided in two parts: Part I presents the investment model and some analytical as well as numerical analysis of the dynamics of this model for fixed investment strategies in different random environments. In this investment model, the dynamics of the investor&rsquo;s budget x(t) depend on the stochasticity of the exogenous return on investment r(t) for which different model assumptions are discussed. The fat-tail distribution of the budget is investigated numerically and compared with theoretical predictions. \u00c2 Furthermore, it is shown that the most probable  value xmp of the budget reaches a constant value over time. Using simulations, the influence of the stochastic factors on the stationary most probable budget value is investigated. The results of these investigations suggest the presence of a scaling function between xmp and the parameters characterizing the stochastic dynamics. The simulation results are corroborated by obtaining the scaling function analytically. Finally, the evolution of the budget of the agent is investigated for real returns from stock market data for different fixed proportions of investment and incomes ...",

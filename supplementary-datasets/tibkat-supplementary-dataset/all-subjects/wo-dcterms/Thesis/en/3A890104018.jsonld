            "abstract": "Abstract: The hydroxylation of inert C\u2013H bonds is a challenge in organic chemistry, even more so in case the reaction shall be performed highly regio- and stereoselective. In nature, the oxidative introduction of hydroxy groups is catalyzed by oxygenases\u2014among them is the family of Fe(II)- and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) dependent non-heme dioxygenases, which generally catalyze their reaction with high regio- and stereoselectivity. This is essential for the production of chiral compounds such as the isomers of hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp). Until recently, three out of four Hyp isomers\u2014trans-4-Hyp, cis-3-Hyp and cis-4-Hyp\u2014were available via enzymatic conversions by bacterial proline hydroxylases (PH). The fourth Hyp isomer trans-3-Hyp was not accessible through enzymatic synthesis.<br>Pneumocandin B0 is the main echinocandin metabolite from the fungus Glarea lozoyensis ATCC 74030 which contains trans-3-Hyp and trans-4-Hyp. To identify a putative trans-3-PH, the four Fe(II)- and \u03b1-KG dependent non-heme dioxygenases GloC, GloE, GloF and GloM from the recently discovered pneumocandin B0 biosynthetic gene cluster were investigated. GloF was identified as the PH responsible for the generation of trans-3-Hyp and trans-4-Hyp during pneumocandin B0 biosynthesis, and, furthermore, for the hydroxylation of trans-4-methyl-L-proline in the biosynthesis of pneumocandin A0. The kinetic parameters of the GloF-catalyzed reactions were determined and its active site was examined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.<br>HtyE is an orthologue of GloF involved in the biosynthesis of echinocandin B in Aspergillus pachycristatus NRRL 11440. Its catalytic characterization revealed similar enzymatic activities as GloF. Both enzymes were applied in crystallization experiments to elucidate their structure which is of particular interest, because they represent a novel group of eukaryotic PHs.<br>To find out whether GloF and HtyE can also act on intermediates in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, tripeptides that contain L-proline, as well as L-proline that was bound to N-acetylcysteamine were applied as substrates in conversion assays.<br>Although GloF and HtyE do not yield trans-3-Hyp selectively, this present work closes the missing gap in the Hyp toolbox. It also elucidates the role of GloF and HtyE in the biosynthesis of echinocandins. It could be shown that the missing incorporation of trans-3-Hyp in echinocandin B biosynthesis compared to pneumocandin bioynthesis i ...",

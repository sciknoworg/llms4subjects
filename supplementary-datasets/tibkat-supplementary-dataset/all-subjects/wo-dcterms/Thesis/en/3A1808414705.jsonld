            "abstract": "The interaction between circadian clocks and metabolism is of increasing interest, since clock dysfunction often correlates with metabolic pathologies. Many research articles have been published analysing the impact of factors such as circadian clock, light, feeding time and diet-type on energy homeostasis in various tissues/organs of organisms with most of the findings done in mammals. Little is known about the impact of circadian clock and the above-mentioned factors on circulating lipids, especially the transport form of lipids - diacylglycerol (DG) and membrane lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the Drosophila hemolymph. The fruit fly Drosophila is a prime model organism in circadian, behaviour and metabolism research. To study the role of circadian clock and behaviour in metabolism, we performed an extensive comparative hemolymph lipid (diacylglycerol: DG, phosphatidylethanolamine: PE, phosphatidylcholine: PC) analysis using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) between wild-type flies (WTCS) and clock disrupted mutants (per01). In addition, clock controlled food intake\u2013 feeding behaviour was investigated. Time-dependent variation of transport (DG) and membrane lipids (PE and PC) were not rhythmic in WTCS under constant darkness and in per01 under LD, suggesting an impact of light and clock genes on daily lipid oscillations. Day-time and night-time restriction of food led to comparable lipid profiles, suggesting that lipid oscillations are not exclusively entrained by feeding but rather are endogenously regulated. Ultradian oscillations in lipid levels in WTCS under LD were masked by digested fatty acids since lipid levels peaked more robustly at the beginning and end of light phase when flies were fed a lipid- and protein-free diet. These results suggest that metabolite (DG, PE and PC) oscillation is influenced by complex interactions between nutrient-type, photic conditions, circadian clock and feeding time. ...",

            "abstract": "Agrochemicals like systemic active ingredients (AI) need to penetrate the outermost barrier of the plant, known as the plant cuticle, to reach its right target site. Therefore, adjuvants are added to provide precise and efficient biodelivery by i.a. modifying the cuticular barrier and increasing the AI diffusion. This modification process is depicted as plasticization of the cuticular wax which mainly consists of very long-chain aliphatic (VLCA) and cyclic compounds. Plasticization of cuticular waxes is pictured as an increase of amorphous domains and/or a decrease of crystalline fractions, but comprehensive, experimental proof is lacking to date. Hence, the objective of this thesis was to i) elucidate the permeation barrier of the plant cuticle to AIs in terms of the different wax fractions and ii) holistically investigate the modification of this barrier using selected oil and surface active adjuvants, an aliphatic leaf wax and an artificial model wax. Therefore, the oil adjuvant methyl oleate (MeO) and other oil derivatives like methyl linolenate (MeLin), methyl stearate (MeSt) and oleic acid (OA) were selected. Three monodisperse, non-ionic alcohol ethoxylates with increasing ethylene oxide monomer (EO) number (C10E2, C10E5, C10E8) were chosen as representatives of the group of surface active agents (surfactants). Both adjuvant classes are commonly used as formulation aids for agrochemicals which are known for its penetration enhancing effect. The aliphatic leaf wax of Schefflera elegantissima was selected, as well as a model wax comprising the four most abundant cuticular wax compounds of this species. Permeation, transpiration and penetration studies were conducted using enzymatically isolated cuticles of Prunus laurocerasus and Garcinia xanthochymus. Cuticular permeability to the three organic solutes theobromine, caffeine and azoxystrobin differing in lipophilicity was measured using a steady-state two-chamber system separated by the isolated leaf cuticles of the evergreen species P. laurocerasus and G. ...",

            "abstract": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an autoimmune disorder affecting close to 1 % of the general population. Psoriasis vulgaris is defined by inflamed and scaling skin plaques that are clearly separated from the surrounding skin. Up to 30 % of psoriasis patients develop additional arthritis symptoms, resulting in a PsA phenotype. PsA is characterized by inflammation of especially distal interphalangeal joints, enthesitis, dactylitis and axial spondyloarthritis, new bone formation and psoriatic skin plaques. The symptoms occur in recurrent flares and without treatment, the disease becomes chronic and disabling. The pathogenesis of PsA is characterized by deregulated interactions between stromal and immune cells and an uncontrolled network of cytokines and chemokines, which leads to failure of resolution. Prominent mediators are immune cells such as neutrophil granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages, T cell subtypes and synovial fibroblasts, which exert their proinflammatory effector function by cytokines and chemokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17 and IL-36. The influencing factors of psoriasis vulgaris and rheumatoid arthritis are overlapping, but the final connection and cause of development of PsA is not yet identified. For this reason, the overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the regulation of inflammatory mediators and immune cells in the phase of inflammation and resolution in PsA. For this purpose a doxycycline-inducible human TNF\u03b1 transgenic (ihTNFtg) mouse model and a mannan-induced model of PsA-like inflammation were used. In both models the mice develop PsA-like symptoms such as paw swelling and skin inflammation and are able to undergo resolution. First, the development of psoriatic and arthritic symptoms, immune cell infiltration, increased osteoclast numbers and osteophyte formation confirmed the ihTNFtg mouse as a suitable model for investigating human PsA. Flow cytometric analyses as well as in vivo imaging of myeloid peroxidase (MPO) activity revealed ...",

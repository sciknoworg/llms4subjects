                "The aim of this study was to examine the relationships of emergency knowledge and emergency experience with risk perception for different events (i.e. fires, floods, earthquakes and terrorist attacks). In particular, the possible cross-over effects of emergency experience on risk perception for other events as well as the impact of multinational objective risk data on risk perception were examined. Furthermore, the relationship of emergency knowledge and emergency experience with distress during a fire was investigated. Both the perceived risk and the event-related knowledge are seen as important initial components in order to adopt preventive behaviors or preparedness measures. Emergency knowledge can be obtained by direct experience with the particular hazard or by receiving information or training. International comparisons within and between different events are rare due to a lack of standardized instruments, and usually refer to one single event therefore, a generalization of results might be difficult since they might be due to the specific characteristics of this one event. Emergency situations such as fires, earthquakes and floods require reactions usually in a short period of time which possibly induces distress during the event. Emergency information and emergency knowledge might be factors that increase the perceived ability to handle the situation and thus may reduce the amount of distress during the events. In order to investigate the impact of emergency ..."

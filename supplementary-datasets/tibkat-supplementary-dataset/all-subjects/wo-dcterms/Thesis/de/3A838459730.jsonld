                "In this thesis we dealt with the numerical treatment of unconstrained problems of optimal control. The goal of this study was to investigate the homotopy method of Costanza and to critically question and expand it. For this purpose, we first investigated problems of optimal control and cited results from functional analysis which were used to derive necessary conditions for unconstrained problems. The main idea is to examine an equivalent, infinite optimization problem and to derive the necessary conditions. The results obtained were applied to unconstrained problems of optimal control. The aim of this approach is to calculate the unknown initial and final values of the state and adjoint functions with regards to freely selectable parameters. This leads to an initial or final value problem which is easier to solve. As it turned out, the homotopy method of Costanza can only be applied to specific cases. We corrected the original approach and generalised it. Afterwards we dealt with the numerical implementation of this approach. We used an explicit Runge-Kutta method with step control (MATLAB: ode45) to solve the ordinary differential equations with given initial values. An important point was the approximation of the Jacobian of the state and adjoint equations using complex step differentiation. This provides faster and more stable approximations to the first derivatives as the central difference quotient which might lead to numerical cancellation. Furthermore, we cited direct ..."

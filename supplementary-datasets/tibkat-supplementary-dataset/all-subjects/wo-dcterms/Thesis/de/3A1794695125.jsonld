                "Due to the high costs of downstream processing, the production of low-value substances from microalgae is currently not economically feasible. On opportunity to reduce the downstream costs is the process of in situ-extraction or milking of microalgae. During this process, the valuable product, which is secreted by the algae cell to the surrounding media, is directly extracted during the cultivation without destroying the cells. With this method, the energy intensive steps of harvesting, dewatering and cell disruption of the conventional process chain can be saved. A suitable microalga for this process is the green algae Botryococcus braunii which accumulates long chain hydrocarbon in an extracellular matrix around the cells. This work shows the selection of a suitable Botryococcus braunii strain for the process of in situ-extraction, the elucidation of the hydrocarbon secretion as well as the phylogenetic connection of the different hydrocarbon structures produced by this alga. Furthermore, this work deals with the optimization of the cultivation conditions of selected Botryococcus braunii strains, as well as the scale-up of the in situ-extraction process from laboratory to semi-technical scale under optimization of the extraction time and particle diameter.The results show, that of the twelve strains examined, the Showa and Bot22 isolates appear to be most suitable for the in situ-extraction process. An identical course of hydrocarbon secretion, which predominantly takes place during cell division, could be determined for both strains. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the primary and secondary structure of the internal transcribed spacer 2 regions of the rRNA, two clades (A and BL) and six subclades (A1, A2, B1, B2, L1 and L2) were determined within the strain Botryococcus braunii, which indicates different metabolic pathways used by the different races of Botryococcus braunii for the hydrocarbon synthesis. By optimizing the extraction time based on the calculation of an extraction coefficient that is independent of the cultivation system, the in situ-extraction process for both strains was successfully transferred from the laboratory scale (3.0 L bubble column reactor) to the semi-technical scale (6.0 L flat panel airlift reactor). By combining all the optimization steps, an in situ-extraction with the strain Showa over 80 days under a total hydrocarbon yield of approx. 125 % of the biomass in the cultivation system could be achieved. The extraction of a higher content of hydrocarbons compared to the biomass concentration in the cultivation system confirms the functionality of the repeated, non-destructive extraction of extracellular compounds from microalgae.$v2022-04-06$v2022-04-06$xN$4LF"

                "Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, die Neigung und Verwindung des solaren Magnetfeldes zu charakterisieren, welche eine wichtige Rolle im Verst\u00e4ndis \u00fcber den Ursprung und Dynamik des Magnetfeldes spielen. Die Neigung bezieht sich auf das Gesetz von Joy, das die von der heliographischen Breite abh\u00e4ngige Neigung von aktiven Regionen relativ zur Ost-West-Richtung beschreibt. Die zweite Gr\u00f6\u00dfe ist die Verwindung des Magnetfeldes, welche misst, wie oft sich magnetische Feldlinien umeinander wickeln. Die erste Studie konzentriert sich auf das Gesetz von Joy.

                "The aim of this thesis is to characterize the tilt and twist of the emerging magnetic field in the solar photosphere, which play an important role in understanding the origin and dynamics of the solar magnetic field. The tilt refers to Joy's law, the latitude dependent inclination of solar active regions relative to the east-west direction. The second observable is the magnetic field's twist, which measures how often magnetic field lines wind around each other.The first study focuses on Joy's law. We used the helioseismic emerging active region survey (HEAR, Schunker 2016) to measure the temporal evolution of Joy's law in line-of-sight magnetograms during the emergence of 182 active regions. We found that on average active regions emerge with zero tilt. The leading and following polarities have an inherit north-south separation speed of unknown origin, which causes Joy's law to develop within one to two days after emergence. These findings are not expected by a popular theory according to which the Coriolis force creates the tilt by acting on plasma flows contained within the rising magnetic field before emergence at the solar surface. Other explanations for Joy's law may be linked to the magnetic field's twist and the conservation of magnetic helicity.We need robust quantitative measurements of the magnetic field's twist to constrain theories of magnetic flux emergence. In the second study, we test the sensitivity of various twist proxies to a fluctuating magnetic field. We modelled a sunspot's magnetic field and its fluctuations based on a time series of HMI/SDO vector magnetic field observations of the leading sunspot in active region NOAA 11072. We found that the magnetic field's temporal fluctuations are spatially correlated on scales up to 1.4~Mm, which is more than expected from the instrument's point spread function alone. We used Monte-Carlo simulations of this sunspot model with different realizations of field fluctuations and found that most twist proxies can be robustly measured with errors that are typically one order of magnitude smaller than the model's inherent twist.  In the third study, we extend the characterization of the twist proxy alpha_z, which measures the ratio of the vertical current to the vertical magnetic field, to vector magnetic field measurements in emerging active regions of the HEAR survey. The hemispheric helicity sign rule, which states that the magnetic field has a preferential orientation of twist with opposite direction in the northern and southern hemisphere, can be retrieved from the data set, when alpha_z is spatially averaged over whole active regions. Averages over the leading and following polarities have opposite signs, which is inconsistent with theories that the polarities are connected by uniformly twisted flux tubes. A closer inspection of the averaged leading polarity revealed a dependence of its alpha_z profile on its longitudinal position relative to the Sun's central meridian. The source of this systematic effect and how it affects the twist measurements must be further studied.$yLinzenz"

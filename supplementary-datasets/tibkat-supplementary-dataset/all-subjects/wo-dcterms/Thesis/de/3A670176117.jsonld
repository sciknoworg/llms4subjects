                "This thesis aims at bridging the gap of deficient understanding of effective buffer zone management. The overall research goal of the thesis is to evaluate buffer zone effectiveness and to identify factors influencing effective buffer zone management in forest biosphere reserves. To address the multi-facetted issue of buffer zone effectiveness an integrative research design was applied. To answer the raised research questions a combination of social science (quantitative and qualitative approaches) and natural science (remote sensing) was chosen. To gain global insights into buffer zone management (research question 1) the quantitative approach of social science research was chosen. As part of a global telephone survey of BR management conducted by the research project in which the thesis was embedded, BR managers were asked to evaluate different management aspects. Between July and December 2006, managers from 225 BRs in 79 countries were interviewed, which corresponds to an overall response rate of 42 %. Answers were statistically analyzed using SPSS 17.0. To obtain detailed information of factors influencing buffer zone management (research question 2) the qualitative social science research approach was applied. A case study was conducted in the Lore Lindu Biosphere Reserve, Sulawesi, Indonesia between March and May 2008 ..."

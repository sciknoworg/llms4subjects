                "Poplar trees have been established as a model organism to study woody perennial plants. The first fully sequenced tree species was Populus trichocarpa. Nevertheless, for experiments in the laboratory often other Populus species are used that are less recalcitrant to transformation than Populus trichocarpa. Amongst others, Populus x canescens, a natural hybrid of P. tremula x P. alba, is a species that is much easier transformable. Due to their fast growth and easy propagation, poplars are also of commercial interest for the pulp and paper industry and serve as a renewable energy resource for the production of biofuel and biogas. Poplars can be planted in short rotation coppices and produce a high amount of biomass within a few years. However, poplar plantations suffer from different pathogens that significantly impair plant growth. Rust fungi of the genus Melampsora are a class of pathogens responsible for major biomass losses due to infection-induced early defoliation as well as a decrease of stem height and stem diameter.Plants recognize microbes with the help of receptor complexes that are specific for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The detection of PAMPs leads to defense reactions like the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades to activate defense genes and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Lysin motif receptor-like kinases (LysM-RLKs) and lysin motif receptor-like proteins (LysM-RLPs) play a crucial role for the recognition of fungal pathogens. They are able to bind different N acetylglucosamine containing molecules and thus also bind the \u03b2 1,4-linked N acetylglucosamine homopolymer chitin which is the major component of the fungal cell wall. Plant receptors that are involved in chitin perception are best studied in Arabidopsis and rice. In Arabidopsis, chitin is detected by a receptor complex consisting of the LysM-RLK CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (AtCERK1) and two other LysM-RLKs, LYK4 and LYK5. In rice the LysM-RLP CHITIN ELICITOR BINDING PROTEIN (OsCEBiP) is the major chitin receptor. However, chitin-triggered responses are dependent on association of OsCEBiP with OsCERK1.In this thesis, LysM-RLKs or LysM-RLPs that play a role for chitin perception in poplar were identified. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Populus trichocarpa genome encodes homologs of all known LysM-RLKs and LysM-RLPs described in the model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus. Mass spectrometry analyses of chitin affinity purified protein samples from Populus trichocarpa and Populus x canescens were performed to identify LysM-RLKs or LysM-RLPs with a potential function in chitin binding and perception. Poplar CERK1 turned out to be the main candidate for a key component of the poplar chitin receptor. In-silico analyses of the protein domains of the two paralogous CERK1 genes, PcCERK1-1 and PcCERK1-2, which are present in Populus x canescens, suggested that both genes encode functional LysM-RLKs with kinase activity. A functional analysis evaluating the role of the PcCERK1 paralogs in ROS burst and MAPK activation was carried out with complementation studies of a chitin-insensitive Arabidopsis Atcerk1 mutant and CRISPR/Cas9 generated knockout mutants in poplar. Complementation could only be accomplished for the PcCERK1 2 gene that partially restored the chitin-triggered MAPK activation of Atcerk1. However, the results from the poplar knockout mutants suggest a function for both PcCERK1 genes in both chitin signaling processes. As possible reason for the lack of complementation ability of PcCERK1-1 and the lack of ROS burst complementation for PcCERK1-2, amino acid substitutions between AtCERK1 and PcCERK1-1/PcCERK1-2 are discussed that might lead to conformational changes and thus impair interaction of PcCERK1 proteins with downstream components of the Arabidopsis signal transduction.Poplar leaves of Pccerk1-1 and Pccerk1-2 single knockouts both had a normal ROS burst response after chitin treatment whereas in the Pccerk1-1 Pccerk1 2 double knockout mutant the chitin-triggered ROS burst was completely abolished. Therefore, a redundant function for both genes mediating the generation of ROS after chitin perception was concluded. MAPK activation in chitin elicitor treated leaf samples was shown to be predominantly dependent on PcCERK1-1. In the Pccerk1-1 single knockout the chitin-triggered MAPK response was strongly impaired while the Pccerk1-2 single knockout showed a wildtype-like response. The slight residual MAPK activation in the Pccerk1-1 single knockout was supposed to be caused by PcCERK1-2 since in the double knockout the ability for chitin-induced MAPK signaling was entirely lost. In leaves PcCERK1-1 has been shown to be significantly higher expressed than PcCERK1 2. Thus, functional analyses and expression data indicate that chitin signaling in Populus x canescens is mainly mediated by PcCERK1-1.In addition to the generation of gene knockouts the overexpression of a kinase dead Pccerk1 1 variant was tested as an alternative strategy for functional analysis. The overexpression was supposed to exhibit a dominant negative effect on chitin signaling. The response to chitin in regard to MAPK and ROS burst signaling was only slightly reduced in a Pccerk1-1_LOF (LOF: loss of function) overexpressor line. This was probably due to a low expression level of the Pccerk1 1_LOF variant since in Arabidopsis Atcerk1_LOF overexpressor lines chitin-triggered ROS and MAPK activation was completely abolished. Another reason might be the presence of homodimeric receptor complexes involving the second paralog PcCERK1-2 that still have signal transduction capacity. Nevertheless, the results indicate that PcCERK1-1 has the kinase activity predicted by in-silico analyses and that this kinase activity is important for signal transduction. In conclusion, the results of this thesis show that both PcCERK1 genes are involved in chitin-triggered defense responses. PcCERK1-1 and PcCERK1-2 have maintained redundant functions in chitin-triggered ROS burst. In contrast to this, PcCERK1 paralogs show a functional diversification in chitin-triggered MAPK activation, which mainly depends on PcCERK1-1.$yLinzenz"

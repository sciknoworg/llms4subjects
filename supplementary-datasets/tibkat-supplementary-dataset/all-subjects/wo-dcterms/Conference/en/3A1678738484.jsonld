                "This is the proceedings of the IUTAM Symposium on Exploiting Nonlinear Dynamics for Engineering Systems that was held in Novi Sad, Serbia, from July 15th to 19th, 2018. The appearance of nonlinear phenomena used to be perceived as dangerous, with a general tendency to avoid them or control them. This perception has led to intensive research using various approaches and tailor-made tools developed over decades. However, the Nonlinear Dynamics of today is experiencing a profound shift of paradigm since recent investigations rely on a different strategy which brings good effects of nonlinear phenomena to the forefront. This strategy has a positive impact on different fields in science and engineering, such as vibration isolation, energy harvesting, micro/nano-electro-mechanical systems, etc. Therefore, the ENOLIDES Symposium was devoted to demonstrate the benefits and to unlock the potential of exploiting nonlinear dynamical behaviour in these but also in other emerging fields of science and engineering. This proceedings is useful for researchers in the fields of nonlinear dynamics of mechanical systems and structures, and in Mechanical and Civil Engineering"

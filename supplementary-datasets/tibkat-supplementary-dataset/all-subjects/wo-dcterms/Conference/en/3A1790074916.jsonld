                "This book focuses on novel materials for advanced engine design including the study of friction, wear, lubrication, suitable lubricant additives, and durability of different engine components of alcohol/biodiesel fueled engines. The contents highlight different lubrication systems to overcome friction and wear problems of automotive transportation systems. It also discusses different materials for future applications, wear of wheels and axels of locomotives, friction-induced noise and vibration and tribological behavior of texture surfaces in the automotive transport sector. This book will be of interest to those in academia and industry involved in alternative fuels application in IC engines, friction and wear study of various engine components, lubrication approaches and different additives of lubricants, and novel materials for advanced engine design."

            "abstract": "Sponsored by the Chinese Ceramic Society, the China International Conference on High-Performance Ceramics (CICC) aims to provide an international forum for the presentation, discussion and review of the latest advances in the science and technology of high-performance ceramics. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The present volume contains selected papers from the third conference in the CICC series: CICC-3, which was held from the 9th to the 12th of May, 2004, in Shenzhen, China. It also contains 19 papers which were specially selected by Prof. Chang-Chun Ge and Prof. Jing-Feng Li from among the papers that were submitted to the First International Workshop on Layered and Graded Materials, which was organized as a special session within the framework of CICC-3. All of the papers which are collected together in this volume were subjected to peer-review and their topics cover almost every facet of high-performance ceramics. The contents can be divided into five broad sections: structural ceramics, functional ceramics, ceramic processing, ceramic characterization and layered or graded materials. The more than 300 papers, submitted to this volume by the many Chinese scholars, provide a treasure-house of invaluable information on the latest advances made in China. In addition, some 30 invited papers and about 50 regular papers presented by scholars from other countries - including Japan, Korea, India, France, Portugal, Sweden, Canada, Taiwan and Hong Kong - accurately reflect recent research activities throughout the world. This volume will therefore be of great interest to any scientist or engineer working in the field of high-performance ceramics",

            "abstract": "These are the proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on the Frontier of Nanoscience and Technology (ICFNST 2011), held in Kunming, China, on September 28-29th, 2011. The aim was to provide a platform from which researchers, engineers and academics, as well as industrial professionals, from all over the world could present their research results and development activities in the fields of Nanoscience and Technology. The work thus presents an eminently up-to-date survey of the subject.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).  Eight volumes hold roughly 1,000 papers (selected from 2,000 submissions) representing the August 2011 conference, which is identified by the acronym GBMCE. Held in Shangri-La, China, the conference attracted participation from 22 national and international organizations. Papers are organized under the very broad themes of building engineering, building materials, civil engineering, energy engineering and materials, environment engineering and materials, manufacturing and design, computer applications in building, and construction information. The papers are widely diverse. A keyword index provides some access to the contents, and an author list is provided for those seeking to find the contributions of particular individuals. A sampling of topics: the impact of infrastructure investment to coordinated urban and rural development in China, passive solar house design strategy in the north-east of China, renewal transformation of existing urban buildings, the use of industrial wastes in Ceramsite for construction, an analysis of earth folk houses along Shandong Canal, soil moisture conserving irrigation under straw mulching, and intelligent lighting system research and design",

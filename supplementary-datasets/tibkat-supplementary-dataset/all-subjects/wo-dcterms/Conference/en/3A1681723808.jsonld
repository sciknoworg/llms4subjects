                "Advances in technology and changes in the business and social environment have led to an increasing flood of data, fueling both the need and the desire to generate value from these assets. The emerging field of Data Science is poised to deliver theoretical and practical solutions to the pressing issues of data-driven applications. The 2nd International Data Science Conference (iDSC2019 / http://www.idsc.at) organized by Salzburg University of Applied Sciences brings together researchers, scientists, and business experts to discuss new ways of embracing agile approaches within the various domains of data science, e.g. machine learning and AI, data mining, visualization and communication, as well as case studies and best practices from leading research institutions and businesses. The proceedings include all full papers presented in the scientific track and the short papers from the student track. Editors Peter Haber is a Professor of Information and Communication Technology, in particular for analog and digital signal processing, and responsible coordinator for system theory and electrical engineering at Salzburg University of Applied Sciences. He is a researcher and project manager, leading and coordinating national and international projects in the field of IT and IT management, while also integrating data science solutions at businesses. Since 2009 he has been a member of the international advisory board for the IATED conferences. Thomas Lampoltshammer is an Assistant Professor for ICT and Deputy Head of the Centre for E-Governance at the Department of E-Governance and Administration, Danube University Krems, Austria.

            "abstract": "This special collection covers the latest theoretical, computational and experimental research on fracture and damage mechanics as well as on structural integrity and durability. It therefore covers a remarkably wide range of topics: Fracture mechanics, Failure analysis, Corrosion, Creep, Non-linear problems, Dynamic fracture, Residual stress, Environmental effects, Crack propagation, Repair techniques, Composites, Ceramics, Polymers, Metallic and concrete materials, Probabilistic aspects, Risk analysis, Damage tolerance, Fracture control, Computer modelling methods (Finite elements, Boundary elements and meshless), Microstructural and Multiscale aspects.This work therefore presents an up-to-date overview of the latest developments in the fields of fracture and damage mechanics, and will be essential reading for anyone having an interest in this key research field. Edited peer-reviewed papers by researchers from 24 countries, which were presented at a September 2009 conference, highlight the latest theoretical, computational, and experimental research on fracture and damage mechanics as well as structural integrity and durability. Although the papers are not grouped in sections, major themes include failure analysis, nonlinear problems, and dynamic fracture, in addition to repair techniques, various types of materials, probabilistic aspects, computer modeling methods, and microstructural and multiscale aspects. Some specific subjects include repairing of degraded hot section parts of gas turbines, energy-based study of structures under accidental damage, vapor pressure modeling for fire damage assessment of HPC, and size effect of a crack in a micropolar piezoelectric medium. Other topics include inelastic damage-involved response of colliding buildings during earthquakes, and cohesive release loads in a general finite element model of a propagating crack. B&w images and illustrations are included. Aliabadi is affiliated with Imperial College-London",

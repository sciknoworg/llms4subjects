            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This volume is a collection of papers presented at the 10th International Autumn Meeting on \"Gettering and Defect Engineering in Semiconductor Technology - GADEST 2003,\" which took place from the 21st to the 26th of September 2003 at the Seehotel Zeuthen, in the state of Brandenburg, Germany. The Seehotel Zeuthen, near Berlin, was an excellent location at which to provide a forum for interactions between scientists and engineers engaged in the field of semiconductor defect physics, materials science and technology; and to reflect upon aspects of the coming era of conversion from micro-electronics to nano-electronics. In addition, a particular ambition was to strengthen the interactions and exchanges between communities working in the fields of crystalline silicon for electronics and photovoltaics. The book comprises 20 invited and 76 contributed papers from over 90 research institutions and from more than 20 countries. The invited papers, contributed by internationally recognized experts, review the state-of-the-art and expected future trends in their respective research fields. The book is organized into 11 sections: Advanced Silicon Materials; Oxygen-, Nitrogen- and Hydrogen-Related Phenomena; Crystalline Silicon for Solar Cells; Silicon-Germanium on Silicon; Extended Defects in Silicon and their Influence on Luminescence; Implantation-Related Phenomena; Point Defects, Impurities and Deep Levels; Dislocations in Semiconductors; Diagnostics, Characterization Techniques; Gettering; Future Aspects",

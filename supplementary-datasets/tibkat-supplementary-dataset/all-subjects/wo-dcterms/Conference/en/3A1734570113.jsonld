            "abstract": "These peer\u2010reviewed papers were selected from \"Materials Science and Engineering Applications\", which provides a forum where researchers, engineers, academics and industrial professionals from all over the world can present their research results and development activities in materials science and engineering. It also provides opportunities for the delegates to exchange new ideas and experiences face-to-face, establish business or research contacts and find global partners for future collaboration. It also creates an atmosphere in which young talent has the opportunity to mix with professors and captains of industry. The proceedings provide an international medium for the publication of theoretical and experimental studies related to the load\u2010bearing capacity of materials as influenced by their basic properties, processing history, microstructure and operating environment.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).  The 104 papers in this collection were selected and peer-reviewed from those presented during the 2nd International Conference on Materials Science and Engineering Application held in January 2012 in Xi'an, China. The varied topics include: a study of the mechanics state of concrete under penetration and the deceleration of projectiles, an experimental study of natural sedimentation in heavy oil, a survey on microgrid technology, research on the effect of erbium salt in the anodization of aluminum, the effects of adding TiC powders to VANADIS 4 tool steel by HIP treatment, developing an effective multipurpose polymer-bitumen compositions, and more. Editors are Chen (Chang'an U., China) and JIang (Xi'an U., China)",

                "The 9th International Workshop on \"Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena\" was held November 6-10, 1989, at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, Cal ifornia. Starting in 1969, thi s represents a continuation of the longest series of meetings in this field in the United States. It is, in fact, the longest series anywhere with published Proceedings that document the advances and the growth of this dynamic field of physics and technology. Following the discovery of the laser in 1960, the study of processes involved in laser beam interactions with materials opened a basically new dimension of physics. The energy densities and intensities generated are many orders of magnitude beyond those previously observed in laboratories. Simultaneously, the temporal dynamics of this interaction covers a broad range, only recently reaching ultra short times, of the order of a few femtoseconds. Applications of this technology are of interest for many types of material treatments. Further, from the very beginning, a key ambitious goal has been to produce fusion energy by intense laser irradiation of a target containi ng appropriate fusion fuels. The vari ous phenomena discovered during the ensuing research on laser-fusion are, indeed, much more complex than originally expected. However, in view of recent advances in physics understanding, a route to successful laser fusion can be seen. The development of fusion energy received a very strong stimulation since the last workshop due to the now partially publicized results of underground nuclear explosions.",

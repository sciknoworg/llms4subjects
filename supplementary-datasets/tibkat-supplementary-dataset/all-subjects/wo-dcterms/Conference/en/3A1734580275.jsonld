            "abstract": "As we have known, X-ray and related techniques are mainly used for quality control and materials characterization study. Most of the equipment used in these activities has contributed a lot to the advancement of materials science, solid state physics, chemistry, medical and other fields. In recent years, there have been a lot of improvements that includes the introduction of an array of software including instrument control, data interpretation and standard data that may provide quick results with enhanced efficiency. IXCRI 2014 aims to exchange and share experiences and research findings in all aspects of X-rays and related techniques among academics, researchers and the industry. Not only that, ICXRI 2014 includes a workshop session, which allows participants to gain a hands-on experience in learning fundamental understanding on X-ray applications. Due to this unique conference-workshop combination, I strongly believe that this conference will have a huge impact and will lead to future innovations and strong linkages among the participants. This is reflected in the number of participants, which amounts to a total of nearly 100 papers being presented here in this conference. Keyword: X-Rays, Materials science The volume collects 101 papers presented during the August 2014 conference on X-ray techniques for characterizing materials and monitoring quality. The Malaysian researchers analyze the response of empty steel tubes to oblique loading, metal foams produced by the slurry method, biological hydroxyapatite obtained from tilapia fish bone, natural cellulose isolated from pineapple leaf fibers, banana trunk as a corrosion inhibitor for carbon steel in seawater, and manganese-bamboo sawdust leached residue. Other topics include anodic oxidation of titanium, silica extraction from rice husk, indoor formaldehyde neutralization, and the performance of rutile as an antibacterial agent in ceramic tiles. \u2014 Materials science\u2014 Radiology\u2014 X-rays",

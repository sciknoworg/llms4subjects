                "This book discusses the latest advances in the broadly defined field of advanced manufacturing and process control. It reports on cutting-edge strategies for sustainable production and product life cycle management, and on a variety of people-centered issues in the design, operation and management of manufacturing systems and processes. Further, it presents digital modeling systems and additive manufacturing technologies, including advanced applications for different purposes, and discusses in detail the implementation of and challenges imposed by 3D printing technologies. Based on three AHFE 2020 Conferences (the AHFE 2020 Virtual Conference on Human Aspects of Advanced Manufacturing, the AHFE 2020 Virtual Conference on Advanced Production Management and Process Control and the AHFE 2020 Virtual Conference on Additive Manufacturing, Modeling Systems and 3D Prototyping, the book merges ergonomics research, design applications, and up-to-date analyses of various engineering processes. It brings together experimental studies, theoretical methods and best practices, highlights future trends and suggests directions for further technological developments and the improved integration of technologies and humans in the manufacturing industry",

                "This book presents the 20th edition of the Inter-Academia Conference which aims to be a valuable resource for academic institutions in search for novel approaches for a global education, for industry partners exploring new fundamental research ideas, for government bodies seeking international projects that promote sustainable growth, and most certainly for the global scientific community, more and more invested in the multi-disciplinarity of modern research. Interdisciplinary research collaboration is crucial for solving many pressing issues and challenges facing society today. Bringing together researchers and educators from different disciplines allows a more holistic understanding of complex problems, providing also the opportunity for new learning and for collaboration on complex projects. Beyond its scientific merits and value, Inter-Academia also promotes a culture of intellectual diversity, innovative thinking, and global perspective that can foster breakthrough discoveries, unexpected advancements in research, and, last but not least, a sense of belonging to a global community. Being established in 2002, the Inter-Academia Community currently gathers researchers from 14 leading Universities in Eastern and Central Europe, together with Shizuoka University, in Japan. As such, the Inter-Academia Community serves as a strong bond across continents, allowing the development of a number of global projects for student and researcher mobility, with a significant impact on the broader scientific community. The peer-reviewed papers included in this book hopefully stimulate further interactions and collaborations covering both fundamental and applied research, with benefits for the global society."

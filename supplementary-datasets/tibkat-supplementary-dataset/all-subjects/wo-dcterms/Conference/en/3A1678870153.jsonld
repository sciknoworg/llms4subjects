                "This book presents the proceedings of the first INCASE conference, organised by ARTC at A*STAR, Singapore. It provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in surface enhancement processes and strategies employed to assess their impact on materials properties and performance. As cyber-physical systems are becoming more and more relevant in manufacturing, it focuses on assessing the readiness of current technologies for future transformations, such as Industry 4.0, identifying the opportunities and challenges, and exploring ways to address them. Written by researchers, practising engineering and industry experts, the book bridges the gap between research and manufacturing, promoting technology adoption in industry and innovative ideas to prepare it for the future",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The 200 peer-reviewed articles in this \"Nanomaterials by Severe Plastic Deformation\" special collection are a convincing demonstration of the relevance of bulk ultrafine grained and nanostructured materials, produced by severe plastic deformation, to a wide range of researchers and engineers., The total number of articles in this edition, larger than that in the 2008 edition, shows that this community is, in fact, growing. The coverage includes all aspects of NanoSPD: Principles of SPD Processing, Microstructural Evolution and Grain Refinement, Mechanical Properties of SPD Materials, Functional and other Properties of SPD Materials, Innovation and Applications. The work presents a thoroughly representative snapshot of the state-of-the-art of this field of research and also constitutes a comprehensive reference source. Though people have been making things by seriously bending and twisting material for a couple of millennia, it was not until the early 1990s that scientists started studying the process in a systematic manner. The NATO workshop of 1999 had become the nanoconference by 2002, and continues to meet every third year. Approximately 200 papers selected this year cover principles of severe plastic deformation processing, microstructural evolution and grain refinement, mechanical and functional properties of the materials, and innovation and applications. Among specific topics are high-pressure torsion for ring samples in different thicknesses, fabricating nanocrystalline copper by explosive dynamic loading, disorientations after severe plastic deformation and their effect on work hardening, microstructure evolution of pure nickel up to a high strain level during equal-channel angular pressing, producing bulk ultrafine grained steel through severe plastic deformation, cooperative grain boundary sliding and shear banding at high strains in ultrafine grained and nanocrystalline lead alloys, the distribution of mechanical properties by volume in titanium billets processed by twist extrusion, and the effects of high pressure torsion on magnetic properties of amorphous alloys. The pages are numbered consecutively and the index appears in both volumes",

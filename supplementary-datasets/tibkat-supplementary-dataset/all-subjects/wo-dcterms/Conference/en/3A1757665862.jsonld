                "This book aims to bring together Researchers, Scientists, Engineers, Scholars and Students in the areas of computer engineering and information technology, and provides a forum for the dissemination of original research results, new ideas, Research and development, practical experiments, which concentrate on both theory and practices, for the benefit of the society. The book also provides a premier interdisciplinary platform for researchers, practitioners and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, and concerns as well as practical challenges encountered and solutions adopted in the fields of Computer Science and Information Technology in the context of Distributed computing, Big data, High performance computing, Internet-of-Things, and digital pedagogy. It is becoming increasingly important to develop adaptive, intelligent computing-centric, energy-aware, secure and privacy-aware mechanisms in high performance computing and IoT applications. This book aspires to convey researchers\u2019 experiences, to present excellent result analysis, future scopes, and challenges facing the field of computer science, information technology, telecommunication, and digital pedagogy. This book aims to attract researchers and practitioners who are working in Information Technology and Computer Science. This book is about basics and high level concepts regarding intelligent computing paradigm, communications, and digital learning process. The book serves as a useful guide for Undergraduates, Postgraduates and Research Scholar in the field of Computer Science, Information Technology, and Electronics Engineering. We believe that this volume not only presents novel and interesting ideas but also will stimulate interesting discussions from the participants and inspire new ideas."

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).These proceedings comprise fully-refereed papers presented at the conference. The main conference theme was Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and the main goal of the event was to provide an international scientific forum for the exchange of new ideas in a number of fields and for in-depth discussions with peers from around the world. Core areas of mechanical and aerospace engineering are covered, together with multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary research and applications; thus making the work an excellent guide to those topics.  This seven-volume set gathers papers from a July 2011 conference. Part 1 contains sections on materials behavior, casting and solidification, powder metallurgy, and ceramic forming. Part 2 covers surface, subsurface and interface phenomena; coatings and surface engineering; composite materials; and materials forming. Part 3 offers papers on machining, nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing, biomedical manufacturing, environmentally sustainable manufacturing processes and systems, and nontraditional manufacturing. Part 4 collects material on modeling and simulation of manufacturing processes. Part 5 groups papers in sections on meso/micro manufacturing equipment and processes, precision molding processes, joining processes, and nanofabrication and nanometrology applications. Part 6 covers manufacturing process planning and scheduling, laser based manufacturing, and metrology and measurement. Part 7 contains papers in sections on computer-aided design and semiconductor materials manufacturing. Some specific topics include exergoeconomic analysis of a steam power plant in Iran, mass transport in a microchannel bioreactor with a porous wall, forced vibration behavior of an adhesively bonded single-lap joint, lean layout in an automotive parts manufacturer, and electro-osmotic flow in a nanotube with power law fluid",

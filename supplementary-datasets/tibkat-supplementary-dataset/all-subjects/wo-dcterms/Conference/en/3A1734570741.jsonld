            "abstract": "The present volumes comprise papers which will provide comprehensive information on the topics of Traditional Building Materials; Advanced Building Materials; Architectural Design, Architectural Art and its Theory; Building Technology and Science; Urban Planning and Design; Landscape Planning and Design; Construction Project Management; Architectural Environment and Equipment Engineering; Ecological Architecture; Engineering Management and Engineering Education; Monitoring and Control of Quality Engineering; Sustainable City and Regional Development. The work\u2019s up-to-date and state-of-the art coverage of the worldwide state of these fields make it an invaluable resource.  This four-volume set provides peer-reviewed papers from a May 2012 conference, written by contributors from industry and academia. The conference was organized on four separate tracks: advances in civil engineering, advances in structures, advanced building materials and sustainable architecture, and sustainable environment and transportation. In Volume 1, papers are grouped in sections on traditional and advanced building materials, looking at specific areas such as sustainable development of China's cement and concrete industry, and reinforced concrete core walls based on fiber models. Volume 2 presents further papers on advanced building materials, plus papers on architectural design, architectural art, and related theory. Some subjects considered include green roof systems with porous ecological concrete, and physical order and disorder in Gothic architecture. Volume 3 provides papers on themes of building technology and science, and urban and landscape planning and design, with material on aspects such as the potential of cloud computing technology for construction collaboration, and ancient Chinese architecture and feng shui. Finally, Volume 4 presents papers on construction project management, architectural environment and equipment engineering, ecological architecture, engineering management and engineering education, monitoring and control of quality engineering, and sustainable city and regional development. B&w photos and images are included",

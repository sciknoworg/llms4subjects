            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This volume presents selected peer-reviewed papers related to diverse aspects of mechanics and materials. Cases related to the flow of fluids under various conditions, as well as heat transfer, are analyzed. There are also contributions, to the field of the design of mechanisms, which focus on biomechanics and the synthesis of mechanisms. Papers on mechanical vibration are linked to the design of machine tools, rotodynamics and vibrations in microbeams. Also, the evaluation of residual stresses and the estimation of the mechanical properties of vegetal materials are treated. Finally, fractal analysis is applied to solar radiation, and to the materials used in nanomedicine. The 21 papers are grouped into: Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Biomechanics and Design of Mechanisms, Mechanical Vibrations, Testing Materials, Fractal Analysis and Numerical Analysis.The result is an intriguing and eclectic guide to some fields of rapidly growing importance. Selected from the conference presentations and peer-reviewed, 21 papers look at mechanical engineering as it is applied in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, biomechanics and the design of mechanisms, mechanical vibrations, testing materials, fractal analysis, and numerical analysis. Among specific topics are an experimental study of water filtering using textiles as in traditional methods, the effect of maximum temperature and heating-cooling repeated cycles on thermal contact resistance of a composite tube, the concept of pneumatic artificial mini-muscles and its application in medical robotics, analyzing stress and vibration in a lathe bed made of an aluminum-copper alloy for high-speed machining, the textile strength of fibers extracted from the leaves of the augustifolia Haw agave as a function of their length, a fractal analysis of the solar radiation in Mexico City, and a parametric analysis of the perfect matched layer model of the finite difference time domain method",

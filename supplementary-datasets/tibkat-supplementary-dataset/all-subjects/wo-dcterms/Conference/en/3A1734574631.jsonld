            "abstract": "Collection of selected, peer reviewed papers from the 2013 3rd International Conference on Frontiers of Manufacturing Science and Measuring Technology (ICFMM 2013), July 30-31, 2013, LiJiang, China. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The 518 papers are grouped as follows: Chapter 1: Practice of Design Engineering and Researches for Industry; Chapter 2: Applied Materials Engineering;Chapter 3: Measuring Technologies, Signal and Data Processing; Chapter 4: Control, Automation, Communication and Information Technologies; Chapter 5: Environmental Engineering, Urban Development, Transportation and Logistics;Chapter 6: Organization of Manufacture and Engineering Management.  This three-volume set collects selected peer-reviewed papers from a July 2013 international conference held in China, revealing the latest Chinese research in measuring and manufacturing science. Volume 1 gathers work in sections on the practice of design engineering and research for industry, and applied materials engineering. Specific topics addressed include cloud design models and the effect of hydrogen on the size of Cu-Ag alloy nanopowders. Volume 2 continues the section on applied materials engineering, then offers work on measuring technologies and signal and data processing. Some topics examined in this section include the effect of magnetic fields of magnetron sputtering on CrN films, and a composite fuzzy control method for temperature in an intelligent moisture analyzer. Volume 3 offers work on control, automation, and communication and information technologies, and organization and management of manufacturing and engineering. Some subjects detailed are the application of logistic models in container throughput prediction, and energy-saving method analysis in the plastic products industry.

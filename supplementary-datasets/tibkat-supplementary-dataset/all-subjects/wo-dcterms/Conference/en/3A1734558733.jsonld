            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Recrystallization and grain growth, together with phase transformations such as precipitation, are the fundamental processes of microstructural evolution which take place during the thermomechanical processing of engineering materials. They are of major scientific interest and are of great importance in a wide range of industrial applications. One of the main goals of this two-volume set is to show how to cover the entire set of reactions governing recrystallization and grain growth during industrial processing \u2013 termed through process modelling. At the same time, it is important to improve the understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in transformations such as nucleation during recrystallization, grain boundary migration under the influence of various forces, and boundary interactions with solute atoms and particles. In this area, modelling plays a major - but happily not yet exclusive - role. These fundamental aspects are also treated in detail in this comprehensive work. There are also a number of papers which deal with new techniques such as laser ultrasonics and high-energy X-ray methods for characterizing deformation structures, recrystallization and grain growth during (in situ) heat treatment. The accent is increasingly placed on 3D observations of all types of crystalline solids, i.e. metals, minerals, ceramics - and now polymers. The reader will be able to find within these two volumes a wealth of up-to-date papers describing current issues, concepts, techniques and results which will, in turn, improve his understanding of recrystallization and grain growth",

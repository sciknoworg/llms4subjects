            "abstract": "The world production of primary and recycled aluminum continues to increase and, over the past twenty years, has risen from ~15 Mt/y in 1985 to ~32 Mt/y in 2005. The main consumers are transportation, beverage and other packaging, and building construction. The global primary aluminum production has been growing by about 2-3% per year. However, growth rates over the last decade have been much higher. In particular, during the past five years, China has played a critical role in aluminum production and has gone through a dramatic period of growth. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The specific topics considered include: Alloys and Phase Transformations, Corrosion and Surface Modification, Deformation and Formability, Fatigue, Fracture and Creep, Joining Technologies, New Directions, Novel Experimental Techniques, Processing and Process Modelling, Recovery, Recrystallization and Texture, Solidification and Casting.Overall, this collection of papers represents a seminal history of the state of knowledge in the aluminum industry, related to the processing and properties of aluminum alloys and, as such, will further contribute to this basic field of knowledge. This two-volume set presents just over 300 papers from the Tenth International Conference on Aluminum Alloys, held in Vancouver, Canada in July of 2006. The proceedings begins with a special technical symposium in honor of Dr. David Lloyd, in recognition of his long-term contributions to the study of the physical and mechanical metallurgy of aluminum alloys and the fact that he \"has provided an excellent example of how one can couple basic science and engineering in an industrial setting.\" Following the David Lloyd Symposium and six plenary addresses, the papers are presented in sections on alloys and phase transformations; deformation and formability; fatigue, fracture, and creep; joining technologies; \"new directions;\" novel experimental techniques; processing and process modeling; recovery, recrystallization, and texture; and solidification and casting. Author and keyword indexes are included at the end of the second volume",

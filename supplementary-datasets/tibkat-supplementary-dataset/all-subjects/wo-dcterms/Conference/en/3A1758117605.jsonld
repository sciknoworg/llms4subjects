                "This book is a reflection of the modern scientific view of current and future problems and prospects of industry development: equipment and technologies. It combines the results of advanced researches of industry development: equipment and technologies in the field of various sciences \u2013 both technical and humanitarian, the synthesis of which allowed forming a holistic meta-scientific concept of industry development: equipment and technologies. The book consists of two parts. The first part reflects technical problems and ways of industry development: equipment and technologies. It examines the promising technologies for modern industrial development, the technogenic factors of neo-industrialization in the context of digital economy, strategic guidelines for the industry development: equipment and technologies from the standpoint of sustainable development, as well as integration mechanisms for the industry development: equipment and technologies, and scientific support for their activation. In the second part, organizational and managerial problems and ways of industry development: equipment and technologies are disclosed. The industry development: equipment and technologies were studied: a view from the standpoint of economics and management, legal barriers to the industry development: equipment: and technologies and the prospects for overcoming them, the impact of globalization on the industry development: equipment: and technologies and recommendations for managing internationalization, as well as social issues of industry development: equipment and technologies in the aspect of human resource\u2019s training and management. The book combines the best works presented at the International Research and Practice Conference\"Actual Problems and Ways of Industry Development: Equipment and Technologies\", organized by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur State University and the Institute of Scientific Communications and held in Komsomolsk-on-Amur (Russia) September 28\u2013October 1, 2020. The target audience of the book is academic scientists studying issues of industry development: equipment and technologies, as well as industrial enterprises and government regulators of industry development: equipment and technologies. ."

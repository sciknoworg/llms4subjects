                "This volume comprises papers from the 18th Conference on Systems Engineering Research (CSER). The theme of this volume, \u201cRecent Trends and Advances in Model-Based Systems Engineering,\u201d reflects the fact that systems engineering is undergoing a transformation motivated by mission and system complexity and enabled by technological advances such as model-based systems engineering, digital engineering, and the convergence of systems engineering with other disciplines. This conference is focused on exploring recent trends and advances in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and the synergy of MBSE with simulation technology and digital engineering. Contributors have submitted papers on MBSE methods, modeling approaches, integration of digital engineering with MBSE, standards, modeling languages, ontologies and metamodels, and economics analysis of MBSE to respond to the challenges posed by 21st century systems. What distinguishes this volume are the latest advances in MBSE research, the convergence of MBSE with digital engineering, and recent advances in applied research in MBSE, including growing convergence with systems science and decision science. This volume is appropriate as a reference text in graduate engineering courses in Model-Based Systems Engineering."

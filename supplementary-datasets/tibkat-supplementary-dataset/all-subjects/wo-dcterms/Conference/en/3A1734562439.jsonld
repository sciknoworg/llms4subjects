            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Magnesium, with its very rich reserves within the Earth, is an important engineering material, but has not yet been fully developed and utilized. Given its low density, magnesium has a higher specific strength and stiffness than many other engineering materials: including aluminum, steel and polymer-based composites. Magnesium also offers other attractive properties: such as a high damping capacity, electromagnetic shielding, dimensional stability, and good machinability and recyclability. As a relatively new structural material, magnesium and its alloys have demonstrated a significant potential for applications in many industries: including automobile, 3C (computer, communication and consumer) products, transportation, power-tools/equipment and new energy sources. In recent years, research and development studies of magnesium have greatly expanded, all around the world, with regard to weight reduction, energy-saving and environmental protection. Significant progress has been made in extraction, casting and forming processes, as well as in alloy development and product applications. The magnesium industry is becoming a rapidly-growing new metals industry in many countries. While current magnesium manufacturing and consumption activities are centered in North America and Europe, new magnesium applications are being  developed all over the globe.The purpose of this book is to provide the latest information on the science, technology and application of magnesium and magnesium alloys. Here, 210 papers are presented which cover all aspects of extraction and recycling, alloys and microstructure, casting, forming and working, property characterization and surface treatment and application of Mg and Mg alloys. This collection will certainly play an important role in helping to promote the research and development of Mg and its alloys",

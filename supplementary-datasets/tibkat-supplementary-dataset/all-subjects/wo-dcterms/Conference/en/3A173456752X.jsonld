            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The papers contained herein cover the most important and timely issues in the field of \"Gettering and Defect Engineering in Semiconductor Technology\", ranging from the theoretical analysis of defect problems to practical engineering solutions, with the emphasis on Si-based materials. Apart from the traditional topics of defect and materials engineering, characterization, modeling and simulation, and the co-integration of various material classes, topics such as materials for solar cells and photonics are discussed. Defects in graphene and in nanocrystals and nanowires are also treated, making this a very up-to-date survey of the field.  Selected papers from a September 2011 meeting deal with fundamental and technological aspects of defects in electronic materials and devices. Papers are organized into 12 sections on areas such as silicon-based and advanced semiconductor materials, nanocrystals and quantum dots, crystalline silicon for solar cells, point defects in Si, defects at interfaces, defect and impurity characterization, gettering and defect engineering, advanced solar cells, silicon-based photonics, and modeling and simulation. Some specific topics addressed include recombination activity of twin boundaries in silicon ribbons, hydrogen decoration of vacancy related complexes in hydrogen implanted silicon, analysis of contaminated oxide-silicon interfaces, and spectroscopic studies of iron and chromium in germanium. Other areas examined include oxygen precipitation studied by X-ray diffraction techniques, structural defect studies of semiconductor crystals with Laue topography, tailoring the electrical properties of undoped GaP, and homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation of oxygen in S-CZ.

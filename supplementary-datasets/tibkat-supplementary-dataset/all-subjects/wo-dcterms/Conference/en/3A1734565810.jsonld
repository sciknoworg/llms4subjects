            "abstract": "The Aluminium Cast-house Technology Conference in Australia is truly an international event where leaders in the aluminium industries of the five developed continents meet every two years. The participants have the opportunity to listen to acknowledged experts in the field and to learn of the latest developments in aluminium processing technology. It is important, especially during the current worldwide financial crisis, to learn what means are available for reducing costs and to learn how others have adjusted to the present situation. These proceedings contain the technical papers presented at the conference and serve as an important reference work for anyone involved with aluminium. The 31 peer-reviewed papers are grouped into: industry directions, safety & environment, dross generation & handling, furnaces & refractories, melt quality & treatment, cast-house productivity, direct chill & continuous casting, and ingot casting. Cost reduction, improved quality, safety, the environment, and new products were among the main concerns at the latest conference on making cast aluminum houses; or aluminium as they say in Australia. Topics of the 31 papers include a historical review and peek into the futures, a life cycle analysis of greenhouse emissions in primary aluminum smelter cast houses, automated metal siphoning and cast house energy consumption, the benefits of forced circulation for aluminum reverberatory furnaces, using electromagnetic fields to detect inclusions in aluminum, estimating the production capabilities of cast-house equipment configuration options, organic coatings to prevent molten metal explosions, and a technological jump in aluminum ingot production",

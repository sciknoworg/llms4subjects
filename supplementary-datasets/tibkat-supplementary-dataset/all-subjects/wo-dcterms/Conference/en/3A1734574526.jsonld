            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).The presented collection of scientific papers is focused on materials, technologies and quality assurance in the field of machines and equipment. These topics are among the fundamental research fields at the Faculty of Engineering of the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra.The collection contains the selection of scientific papers that present knowledge resulting from work on scientific projects supported by the Structural Funds of the European Union: Operational Programme Education ITMS 26110230020 \u2013 Development of human resources and quality assurance at the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra; Operational Programme Education ITMS 261102230057 \u2013 To increase the quality of education at the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra and to achieve its adaptation to current and prospective needs of society (QEDU); Operational Programme Research and Development ITMS 26220220014 \u2013 Application of information technologies to increase the environmental and economic sustainability of production agrosystem (ITEPAg) as well as scientific projects supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic: VEGA No 1/0576/09 \u2013 Increasing the quality of agricultural machines and production equipment; VEGA No 1/0813/10 \u2013 Degradation of metallic materials in the processes of production and exploitation of alternative fuels; VEGA No 1/0462/09 \u2013 Elimination of unfavourable impacts of machinery on agricultural land, water and air; and VEGA No 1/0857/12 \u2013 Reducing of unfavourable impacts of agricultural and transport machinery on environment.Experiments presented in the papers were performed in internal laboratories of the Faculty of Engineering (SUA in Nitra) as well as in close cooperation with the companies Inweld Consulting, s.r.o. Vr\u00e1ble; Sandvik Coromant, s.r.o. Bratislava, Bibus SK, s.r.o. Nitra, Slovintegra Energy, s.r.o. Levice; Veolia Transport Services, s.r.o.; Slovnaft, a.s. Bratislava; and Intertribodia, s.r.o. Part of experiments was performed in cooperation with foreign universities, namely the V\u0160B\u2013Technical University of Ostrava and the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. Knowledge presented in the contributions focuses on materials, increasing the reliability of machines and equipment, increasing the quality of production and ultimately increasing the economic effectiveness and market competitiveness",

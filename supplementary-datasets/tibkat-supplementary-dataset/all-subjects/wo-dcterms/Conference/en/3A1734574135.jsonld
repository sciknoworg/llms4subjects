            "abstract": "Damage assessment of structures is an emerging field and has become increasingly important over the past decade or two. Diagnosis and prognosis of structural damage plays an important role not just in ensuring the structural integrity but also in optimizing the overall life cycle cost including the cost for operation and maintenance. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The Special collection consists of a compilation 159 papers on all research topics relevant to damage assessment of engineering structures and systems including numerical simulations, signal processing of sensor measurements, theoretical and experimental studies. Broad areas of damage assessment covered in the publication include applications to composite materials, civil infrastructure, mechanical devices and machineries, renewable energy, sensors, signal processing, structural health and condition monitoring.  The biennial international conference presents theoretical and experimental studies, numerical simulations, and signal processing of sensor measurements for assessing damage in engineering structures and systems. This year, 159 papers cover composite materials, damage in civil infrastructure, damage in machinery, and renewable energy. The keynote addresses discuss a full-field stress-based damage assessment approach for the in situ inspection of composite structures, and assessing damage in structures using only post-damage vibrational measurements. Other topics include the rapid assessment of natural periods of large short-period civil engineering structures, utilizing data from a sensorless alternating-current variable-speed drive for detecting mechanical misalignments, a two-stage scheme for identifying plate damage based on lock-in thermography and dynamic analysis, and a synthetic aperture focusing technique for detecting transverse cracks in austenitic and dissimilar welds. The two volumes are paged and indexed together",

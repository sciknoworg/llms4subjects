            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The last five decades have seen an explosion of interest in exploring the possibilities of new materials for industrial and commercial applications. Materials Technology is now recognized as being one of the most important factors driving the development and growth of a nation\u2019s economy. The sciences of design, processing, manufacturing and materials utilization are crucial elements contributing to the growth of new industries. The need for new discoveries in Materials Science has encouraged scientists from around the world to meet regularly and to discuss the latest advances and innovations. The primary objective of the present collection was to provide a meeting ground and a common platform whereon scientists, working in the various sub-disciplines of Advanced Materials and Devices, could present and discuss their work. It therefore provides an incomparable international forum for the presentation of recent developments in the areas of functional materials. Sixty-one papers from the June 2005 conference present recent research on the design, processing, and manufacturing of new materials for industrial and commercial applications. The primarily Malaysian contributors investigate oxide powder phosphors prepared by microwave heating, photoluminescence processes in the triplet state of phosphorescent organic materials, the surface morphology of anatase titanium dioxide derived by sol-gel, and PEO-KOH films plasticized with ethylene sulphite. Other topics include the molecular orientation of phospholipids Langmuir-Blodgett films, a gas sensor based on AlGaN, the effects of indium deposition on porous silicon nanostructure, and modification of epoxy resin using liquid natural rubber",

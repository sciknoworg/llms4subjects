                "In September 2009, a meeting was held in Palm Cove, Australia, which brought together the world experts in the Maillard or 'browning' reaction. This reaction causes the browning of foods when they are heated and in chocolate, caramel and beer, this reaction is appetizing, contributing to aroma, taste and texture. But when these products accumulate in the body, this same process contributes to disease and ageing. The book is the proceedings of that meeting, held in response to a growing recognition of the role reactive carbonyl compounds play in food technology, nutrition and tissue ageing in b"

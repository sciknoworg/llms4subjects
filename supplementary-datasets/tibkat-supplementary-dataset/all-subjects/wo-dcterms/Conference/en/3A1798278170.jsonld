                "This book highlights the proceedings of the International Conference on Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Nano-Physics with Applications (CAMNP 2019), organized by the Department of Applied Physics, Delhi Technological University, New Delhi, India. It presents experimental and theoretical studies of atoms, ions, molecules and nanostructures both at the fundamental level and on the application side using advanced technology. It highlights how modern tools of high-field and ultra-fast physics are no longer merely used to observe nature but can be used to reshape and redirect atoms, molecules, particles or radiation. It brings together leading researchers and professionals on the field to present and discuss the latest finding in the following areas, but not limited to: Atomic and Molecular Structure, Collision Processes, Data Production and Applications Spectroscopy of Solar and Stellar Plasma Intense Field, Short Pulse Laser and Atto-Second Physics Laser Technology, Quantum Optics and applications Bose Einstein condensation Nanomaterials and Nanoscience Nanobiotechnolgy and Nanophotonics Nano and Micro-Electronics Computational Condensed Matter Physics."

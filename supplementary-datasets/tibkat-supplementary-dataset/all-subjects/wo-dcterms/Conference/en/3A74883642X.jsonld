            "abstract": "This publication contains the proceedings of the 34th Biennial Session of the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) and the Interbull Meeting held in Sousse, Tunisia from 28th May to 3rd June 2004.The book is divided in five sessions, containing in total 50 technical papers and reports. One key session debates the traceability and all subjects involved in animal health recording. This publication also presents, for the first time, the statistics of the \"Yearly inquiry on the situation of milk recording in ICAR member countries. Results for the years 2001 and 2002\" are up-dated to April 2004. About 35 pages are devoted to national milk productions, their recording costs, position of milk recording and the results of milk recording divided by breeds and are presented in easy to read tables. The main topics covered in this book are: - the latest genetic improvement techniques for the global dairy industry; - the potential to create an international beef evaluation system; - presentation of advancing new technical standards for identification, performance testing, as well as a discussion of global priorities for livestock management; - new tools to improve the fertility of dairy cows. New technologies have always been important in ICAR forums for members to understand and discuss. In this conference electronic identification and measurement, DNA recording, and internet services were debated, with an exchange of experiences by the delegates. Finally, new strategies for potential new services for the ICAR member organisations were discussed. One such proposal was for an international benchmarking service for measuring and comparing the activities of ICAR organizations",

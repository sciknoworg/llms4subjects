                "This book provides state-of-the-art information on ambient assisted living (AAL), and focuses on technologies, services, living spaces, policies, and interventions to promote health, improve quality of life, and active aging. It includes various research contributions, case studies, and projects where assistive technologies are successfully applied in the field, and it covers a wide range of topics: Tailoring products and services to the Aging society, Bio-data and Artificial sensing AAL scenarios, Cognition, and Technologies, and Designing for Inclusion and Well-Being. The volume gathers the refereed proceedings of the 12th Italian Forum on Ambient Assisted Living (ForItAAL), held in Bari, Italy on June 14-16, 2023. With its wide-ranging contributions to the topic, the book will inspire the readers and the researchers to continue their exploration of AAL technologies to support the development of products and services that make a real difference in people\u2019s daily lives.",

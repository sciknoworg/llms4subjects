            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The aim of this special collection was to provide an opportunity for companies, academic institutions and government research agencies to share, in a collaborative manner, their new research and development work.The main focus was light metals and their applications.It is to be noted that there was a significant number of papers related to titanium research: due to the extended range of applications of titanium components and the growth in end-user demands for affordable manufacturing. As a result, the collection is truly representative of the three light metals: aluminium, magnesium and titanium; with a similar number of papers concerning each metal. The papers are grouped into the chapters: 1. Business and Environment; 2. Joining of Light-Metal Alloys; 3. Magnesium - Medical; 4. Titanium - Aerospace; 5. Simulation, Modelling and Materials Science; 6. Light-Metals Forming; 7. Magnesium Surface Modification; 8. Aluminium Surface Modification; 9. Titanium - Medical; 10. Aluminium Heat Treatment and Processing; 11. Innovation in Light Materials; 12. Magnesium Casting; 13. Magnesium Microstructure and Properties; 14. Titanium Near-Net Shape; 15. Magnesium Processing; 16. Aluminium Microstructure; 17. Aluminium Casting; 18. Powder Metallurgy and Near-Net Shape.This book will therefore be essential reading-material for anyone working in the light-metal alloy field. This volume gathers together 122 selected papers from the 4th International Conference on Light Metals Technology, held in Queensland, Australia, in June and July 2009. Individuals from companies, academia, and government research agencies from across the globe share their research on light metals\u2014titanium, aluminum, and magnesium\u2014and their applications, with specific discussion of business and environment; forming; the joining of alloys; simulation, modeling, and materials science; surface modification; heat treatment and processing; innovations; microstructure and properties; casing; powder metallurgy and near net shape; and applications in medical and aerospace fields. There is a significant increase in the number of papers on titanium due to the growing number of applications",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This book brings together 288 peer-reviewed papers on Manufacturing Science and Measuring Technology in order to promote the development of those fields, to strengthen international academic cooperation and communications and to exchange research ideas. It provides readers with a broad overview of the latest advances in the field of manufacturing science and measurement technology.  A June 2011 conference was held in Chongqing, China, to promote the development of measuring and manufacturing science, strengthen international academic cooperation and communication, and exchange research ideas. These peer-reviewed papers from the conference provide a broad overview of the latest advances in the field of manufacturing and measuring science. Volume 1 presents work on manufacturing science; some specific paper topics in this section are applications of accuracy engraving techniques in motorcycle new-product development, a novel particle swarm algorithm to optimize QoS unicast routing, and research on system aging using fuzzy reliability based on discrete-time conditions. Volume 2 concentrates on manufacturing and measuring technology, covering subjects such as optimization of non-uniform sensing coverage for wireless sensor networks, and analysis and structural topology optimization for beam cross sections. Volume 3 focuses on manufacturing automation, presenting work on aspects such as a fast algorithm for choosing delay time for strange attractors, alkali corrosion resistance mechanisms of Ni-Cr-Cu alloy cast iron, and the effects of roller profile modification on roller bearing performance. Some papers are illustrated with small format b&w images and photos",

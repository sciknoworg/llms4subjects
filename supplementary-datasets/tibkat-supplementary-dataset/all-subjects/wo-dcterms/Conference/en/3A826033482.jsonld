            "abstract": "Annotation, Artificial intelligence has become so much a part of everyday life that it is now hard to imagine a world without it. This book presents papers from the 12th Scandinavian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (SCAI), held in Aalborg, Denmark in November 2013. The SCAI conference is the main biennial platform for the AI research community in Scandinavia, and the papers collected here not only include contributions from Scandinavia, but also from other European and non-European countries. Topics cover the entire range of AI, with a particular focus on machine learning and knowledge representation, as well as uncertainty in AI and applications. In addition to the 28 regular papers, extended abstracts of the presentations made by Ph. D. students of their research-in-progress to a panel of experts in the doctoral symposium - a new feature at this conference - are also included here. This book will be of interest to all those who wish to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in artificial intelligence.--",

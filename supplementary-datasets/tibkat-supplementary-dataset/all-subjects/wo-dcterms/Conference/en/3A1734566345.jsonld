            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Increasing urbanization constitutes a mounting threat to cultural heritage sites around the world; especially in developing countries. Natural and man-made environmental hazards are causing more damage to historic constructions than ever before. The conservation of historical constructions is facing new challenges introduced by waves of immigration and industrialization. The present papers on this subject are organized into two volumes, and the topics of interest span the entire spectrum of structural analyses of historic constructions: including Materials and Structural Configuration, Structural Inspection and Monitoring, Structural Analysis and Assessment, Seismic Analysis and Evaluation, Strengthening Technologies, Rehabilitation and Retrofitting and Sustainable Utilization of Historic Constructions in China. It is the hope of the editors that this special collection will stimulate scientists and technologists to develop further theories and technologies and help them in their endeavors in conserving historic constructions, now and tomorrow.  The October 2010 conference held in Shanghai, China was the seventh conference on the topic announced in the title. Out of 280 submissions, 199 papers were selected and are presented here along with nine keynote papers, in two volumes. Case studies from many parts of the world are included. Arrangement is according to the following broad themes: material and structural configurations, structural inspection and monitoring, structural analysis and assessment, strengthening technologies, rehabilitation and retrofitting, and sustainable utilization of historic buildings in China. Among the topics addressed in the keynote papers: cultural heritage buildings and the Abruzzo earthquake, recent results on masonry infill walls, conservation of heritage structures in Turkey, seismic and wind performance of a five-storied timber pagoda, and consequences of archeological excavations. The two editors are affiliated with the department of building engineering of Tongii University, which was one of the sponsors and organizing institutions along with the China Civil Engineering Society, the Shanghai Research Institute of Building Science, the National Key Technology R&D Program of China, the National \"211\" Plan of China, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China",

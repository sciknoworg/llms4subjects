            "abstract": [
                "NATO Advanced Research Workshop \"Environmental Protection Against Radioactive Pollution\" was held in Almaty on September 16-19, 2002. Experts from Azerbaijan, Denmark, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Norway, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Ukraine, USA, Uzbekistan and the IAEA have participated and made presentations. The Workshop was organized parallel to the \u201c2nd Eurasia Conference on Nuclear Science and its Application\u201d held in Almaty on September 16-19, 2002 that was organized by Institute of Nuclear Physics of Kazakhstan with Turkish Atomic Energy Authority and National Academy of Science of Azerbaijan, National Academy of Science of Kyrgyzstan, Institute of Nuclear Physics of Uzbekistan. So, the number of participants for the Workshop was rather high. The NATO Advanced Research Workshop generated important interactions and provided a mechanism for scientists of different nations and of varied disciplines to discuss challenges that confront many countries around the world. The reports presented at the Workshop were published in this NATO Science Series. The main directions of the presented reports were as follows; General estimation of the radioactive contamination of the territories and radiation hazardous objects, including former military test sites, areas influenced due to Chernobly and Mayak accidents, and territories of oil fields; Techniques and procedures of radioecological monitoring; Techniques of determination of radionuclide concentrations and its species in the environment.",

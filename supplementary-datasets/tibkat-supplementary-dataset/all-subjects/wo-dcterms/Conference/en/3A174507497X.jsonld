                "This book contains a collection of 13 carefully selected papers contributed by researches in technical and partial medical diagnostics as well as fault-tolerant control and constitutes a comprehensive study of the field. Nowadays technical diagnostics and fault-tolerant control are a field of intensive scientific research that covers well-established topics along with emerging developments in control engineering, artificial intelligence, applied mathematics and statistics. At the same time, a growing number of applications of different fault diagnosis methods, especially in the electrical, mechanical, chemical and medical areas, are being observed. The aim of the book is to show the bridge between technical and medical diagnosis based on analytical and artificial intelligence methods and techniques. The book is divided into three parts: I. Fault-Tolerant Control and Reconfiguration, II. Fault Diagnosis of Processes and Systems, III. Medical Applications. The book is of interest to scientists, engineers and academics dealing with the problems of designing technical diagnosis and fault-tolerant control systems. Its target readers are also junior researchers and students of control, artificial intelligence and computer engineering."

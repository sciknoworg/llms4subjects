            "abstract": "Annotation, With the ever expanding range of computing platforms and applications, system complexity is on the rise. Increasing intelligence and autonomics in today\u00bfs systems requires innovative approaches to address these concomitant complexity issues. At this cross-section of volume and complexity, current technologies are often ineffective at coping with the demands for quality computer systems. To cope with these and other complexity issues, computer systems are modeled or specified using multi-paradigm approaches often requiring instruments and tools to visualize and understand. Advancements in formal modeling, instrumentation, and information visualization are providing traction on this important area. Whether traditional, formal models or more innovative approaches are employed; these solutions are at the frontier of systems and software engineering. The goal of this conference is to assemble industrial, academic and government experts, from a variety of user domains and software disciplines, to examine key complexity problems and effective solutions. ICECCS 2006 covers wide scope of interests including long-term research, near-term complex system requirements and promising tools, existing systems, and commercially available tools",

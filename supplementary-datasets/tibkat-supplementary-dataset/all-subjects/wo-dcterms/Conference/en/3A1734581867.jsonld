            "abstract": "This special topical volume on \u2018Sustainable Building Materials and Materials for Energy Efficiency\u2019 is aimed to cover the recent advancements and trends in the area of building materials with reference to energy efficiency and sustainability. Sustainable building materials minimizes the consumption of earth\u2019s resources and help in maintaining the ecosystem balance and in return proves to be economical, not just during construction but also year after year. Using sustainable building materials promotes conservation of dwindling nonrenewable resources internationally. Integrating sustainable and energy efficient building materials into building projects can help reduce the environmental impacts associated with the extraction, transportation, processing, fabrication, installation, reuse, recycling, and disposal of these building industry source materials. The volume will be of special interest to environmentally-minded producers and suppliers of building materials and to engineers, architects and building workers, but it may also be of use to readers and researchers who are interested in building construction but who lack specialist technical knowledge. Keyword: building materials There are two themes to the volume. One is to reduce emissions during the construction of buildings, including the production, processing, and transport of the building materials. The other is to design and build buildings that are more environmentally sustainable than conventional ones. The topics include alternative building material using industrial and agricultural wastes, environmental sustainability through recycling incineration bottom ash for producing autoclaved aerated concrete, a parametric study on exterior insulation systems and heat reflective paints for energy efficiency in buildings, and natural pozzolan mortars exposed to chlorides as a sustainable building material. \u2014 Civil engineering\u2014 Construction -- Sustainability\u2014 Materials science",

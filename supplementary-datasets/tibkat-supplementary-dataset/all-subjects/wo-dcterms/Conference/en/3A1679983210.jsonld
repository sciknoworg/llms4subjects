                "This book reports on cutting-edge findings concerning characterization of material behavior, material modeling and simulation, and applications in the field of manufacturing. Based on the second International Conference on Advanced Materials Mechanics & Manufacturing, A3M2018, organized by the Laboratory of Mechanics, Modeling and Manufacturing (LA2MP) of the National School of Engineers of Sfax, Tunisia, the book covers a variety of topics, such as experimental analysis of material plasticity and fatigue, numerical simulation of material behavior, and optimization of manufacturing processes, such as cutting and injection, among others. It offers a timely snapshot on current research and applications, offering a bridge to facilitate communication and collaboration between academic and industrial researchers",

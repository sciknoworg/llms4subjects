                "This book provides scientific research into Cognitive Internet of Things for Smart Society, with papers presented at the 2nd EAI International Conference on Robotic Sensor Networks. The conference explores the integration of networks and robotic technologies, which has become a topic of increasing interest for both researchers and developers from academic fields and industries worldwide. The authors posit that big networks will be the main approach to the next generation of robotic research, with the explosive number of networks models and increasing computational power of computers significantly extending the number of potential applications for robotic technologies while also bringing new challenges to the network's community. The 2nd EAI International Conference on Robotic Sensor Networks was held 25-26 August 2018 at the Kitakyushu International Conference Center (MICE), Kitakyushu, Japan"

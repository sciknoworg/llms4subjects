                "This book encompasses select proceedings of NSEST-2020 and ECSIRM-2020. The volume covers advances in major areas of electrochemical science and technology and surface engineering. It covers all aspects of electrochemistry with more emphasis on corrosion. The corrosion topics include self-healing sol-gel based corrosion resistant coatings, nitric acid corrosion of stainless steel, stress corrosion cracking, etc. Few chapters are focused on electrodeposition and new materials for oxygen evolution catalysts, fuel cells and batteries. The chapters on molecularly imprinted polymer sensor for dual analytes, electrochemical sensors for lead ions and dopamine, etc., are of interest. Some papers are related to the green synthesis of nanosized oxides and superhydrophobic coatings. This book will be handy and beneficial to researchers, students, and professionals working in areas related to electrochemistry and surface engineering. .",

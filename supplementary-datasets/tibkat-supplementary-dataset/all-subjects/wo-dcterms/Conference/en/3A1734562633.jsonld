            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Natural, as well as man-made, materials are often assumed to behave uniformly, exhibiting equal strength in all directions, because most of them have a polycrystalline structure. The anisotropy of the individual crystals, however, is smoothed out only in the presence of a large number of grains having a random distribution of orientations. In reality, there usually remains an anisotropy due to the existence of preferred orientations. Its magnitude depends upon the statistical distribution of grain orientations \u2013 the \"crystallographic texture\" or, more simply, the texture. \u2013This governs the extremes, of the physical property of interest, which a single crystal of the material under consideration can exhibit in directional tests. Local variations in texture, as well as the arrangements and types of grain/phase boundaries, may give rise to inhomogeneous material properties. The texture also carries with it information on the history of a material\u2019s processing, use and misuse. A knowledge of the texture is a prerequisite for all quantitative techniques of materials characterization, and is based upon the interpretation of diffraction-peak intensities. It is also necessary to model the relationships between microstructural features and physical or mechanical properties. Therefore, the texture is of great value for quality control in a wide range of industrial applications, and in basic materials research. Notable advances in experimental and theoretical methods of texture analysis, and in its use for understanding or predicting materials\u2019 behavior have been made recently. It is the aim of this collection to provide a timely survey of the state of the art of texture analysis, as exemplified by some typical applications. This 480-page volume comprises 74 papers which cover almost all aspects of texture research and will serve as a useful guide to this challenging field",

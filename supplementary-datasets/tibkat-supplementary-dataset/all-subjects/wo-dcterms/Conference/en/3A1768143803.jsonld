                "This book presents the select proceedings of Conference on Research and Developments in Material Processing, Modelling and Characterization (RDMPMC 2020). It highlights the new technologies developed in the generation of rational materials for various applications with tailored properties. It covers fundamental research in emerging materials which includes biomaterials, composites, ceramics, functionally graded materials, energy materials, thin film materials, nanomaterials, nuclear materials, intermetallic, high strength materials, structural materials, super alloys, shape memory alloys and thermally enhanced materials. It includes the numerical modeling and computer simulation to investigate the properties and structure of materials. Few of the most relevant manufacturing techniques highlighted in this book are welding, coating, additive manufacturing, laser-based manufacturing, advanced machining processes, casting, forming and micro and nanoscale manufacturing processes. Given its contents, this book is beneficial to students, researchers and industry professionals. .",

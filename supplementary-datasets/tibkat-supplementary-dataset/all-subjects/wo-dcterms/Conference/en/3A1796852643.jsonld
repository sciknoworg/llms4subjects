            "abstract": "This book gathers the proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Architecture, Materials and Construction (ICAMC), held in Lisbon, Portugal on October 27-29, 2021. ICAMC serves as an international forum for the presentation of the latest technological advances and research results in the fields of architecture and urban planning, civil and structural engineering, and materials manufacturing and processing. As such, it explores highly diverse topics, including innovative construction technologies (computer and digital manufacturing) and materials (polymers, composites, etc.); traditional materials (glass, wood, steel, concrete, stone, brick, etc.) and its harmonic combination which can be achieved by evaluating their structural and non-structural properties; the key concepts of efficiency and sustainability related to the architectural design and engineering of new buildings; analysis, rehabilitation and restoration of buildings. The contributions, which were selected by means of a rigorous international peer-review process, highlight numerous exciting ideas that will spur novel research directions and foster multidisciplinary collaborations.",

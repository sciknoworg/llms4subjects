            "abstract": "The Networks and Systems in Cybernetics section continues to be a highly relevant and rapidly evolving area of research, encompassing modern advancements in informatics and cybernetics within network and system contexts. This field is at the forefront of developing cutting-edge technologies that can tackle complex challenges and improve various aspects of our lives. The latest research in this field is featured in this book, which provides a comprehensive overview of recent methods, algorithms, and designs. The book comprises the refereed proceedings of the Cybernetics Perspectives in Systems session of the 12th Computer Science Online Conference 2023 (CSOC 2023), which was held online in April 2023.    The book offers a unique opportunity to explore the latest advances in cybernetics and informatics and their applications in a range of domains. It brings together experts from various disciplines to share their insights and collaborate on research that can shape the future of our world.    One of the key themes of this section is the application of cybernetics in intelligent systems. This area has significant potential to revolutionize a range of industries. Researchers are exploring how cybernetic principles can be used to create intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and optimize their performance over time",

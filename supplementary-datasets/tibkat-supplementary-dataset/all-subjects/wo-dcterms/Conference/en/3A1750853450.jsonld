                "This book collects perceptions and needs expectations and experiences concerning the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in the steel sector. It contains a selection of themes discussed within the Workshop entitled \u201cImpact and Opportunities of Artificial Intelligence in the Steel Industry\u201d organized by the European Steel Technology Platform as an online event from October 15 until November 5, 2020. The event aimed at analyzing the diffusion of AI technologies in steelworks and at providing indications for future research, development and innovation actions addressing the sector demands. The chapters treat general analyses on transversal themes and applications for process optimization, product quality enhancement, yield increase, optimal exploitation of resources and smart data handling. The book is devoted to researchers and technicians in the steel or AI fields as well as for managers and policymakers exploring the opportunities provided by AI in industry."

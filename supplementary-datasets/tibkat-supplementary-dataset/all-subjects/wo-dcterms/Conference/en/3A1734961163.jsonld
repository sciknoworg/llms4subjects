            "abstract": "This book reports on research and developments in human-technology interaction. A special emphasis is given to human-computer interaction, and its implementation for a wide range of purposes such as healthcare, aerospace, telecommunication, and education, among others. The human aspects are analyzed in detail. Timely studies on human-centered design, wearable technologies, social and affective computing, augmented, virtual and mixed reality simulation, human rehabilitation and biomechanics represent the core of the book. Emerging technology applications in business, security, and infrastructure are also critically examined, thus offering a timely, scientifically-grounded, but also professionally-oriented snapshot of the current state of the field. The book is based on contributions presented at the 2nd International Conference on Human Interaction and Emerging Technologies: Future Applications, IHIET-AI 2020, held on April 23-25, in Lausanne, Switzerland. It offers a timely survey and a practice-oriented reference guide to researchers and professionals dealing with design and/or management of the new generation of service systems.",

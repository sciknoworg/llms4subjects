                "The book focuses the latest endeavors relating researches and developments conducted in fields of control, robotics, and automation. Through more than ten revised and extended articles, the present book aims to provide the most up-to-date state of the art of the aforementioned fields allowing researcher, Ph.D. students, and engineers not only updating their knowledge but also benefiting from the source of inspiration that represents the set of selected articles of the book. The deliberate intention of editors to cover as well theoretical facets of those fields as their practical accomplishments and implementations offers the benefit of gathering in a same book a factual and well-balanced prospect of nowadays research in those topics. A special attention toward \u201cIntelligent Robots and Control\u201d may characterize another benefit of this book."

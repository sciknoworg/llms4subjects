            "abstract": "The aim of this special collection of peer-reviewed papers is to present recent progress in crystal growth, in the characterization and control of material properties, as well as in other basic research issues concerning silicon carbide (SiC) and other wide-bandgap semiconductors such as group-III nitrides and diamond. The latest research results relevant to wafer production processes, device fabrication technologies and device applications are discussed. These included the latest results in the development and commercialization of advanced devices and circuits used for energy saving, high-voltage switching, high-frequency high-power amplification and high-temperature operation. Work on the growth, characterization and device exploitation of epitaxial graphene was also covered. Evolving industrial products and capabilities were also highlighted.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).  This two-volume set presents proceedings from a September 2011 conference report on the latest work in microelectronics and MEMS technology based on silicon carbide (SiC) and related materials. Papers reflect recent progress in crystal growth, characterization and control of material properties, and other basic research in silicon carbide and other wide-bandgap semiconductors involving III-nitrides and diamond. They describe the latest research relevant to water production processes, device fabrication technologies, and device applications, as well as the latest developments and commercialization of advanced devices and circuits used for energy saving, high-voltage switching, high-power amplification, and high-temperature operation. Volume 1 compiles papers in chapters on SiC bulk growth, SiC epitaxial growth, physical properties and characterization of SiC, and graphene. Volume 2 presents chapters on processing of SiC, SiC devices, circuits, and systems, and related materials",

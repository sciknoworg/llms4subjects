            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The main objective of this very up-to-date collection of papers is to gather together the latest information on the state of acoustic emission (AE) testing, with particular emphasis being placed on scientific and technical developments. The book covers a wide range of activities relevant to the acoustic emission of engineering structures and systems; including data processing, analytical techniques and experimental case-studies. The coverage is broad, and ranges over all aspects of the topic: from detailed theoretical studies to case-studies arising from real damaged structures. The types of structure studied also vary widely, and the techniques highlighted here are applicable to many engineering fields: mechanical and civil engineering, in particular. AE testing is now well-established in Europe in several important areas of proof-testing, in-service monitoring, corrosion and leak detection. The development of the technology continues to be driven by the needs of industry to reduce inspection and maintenance costs while protecting assets and preserving personnel safety. The AE testing of large complex structures such as bridges and aircraft is driving forward the elaboration of advanced research techniques. Advances in PC technology have also had a positive influence on new developments in the design of hardware and software for powerful testing equipment.This exciting book therefore offers a wealth of new ideas to ambitious researchers in this subject area. Acoustic emissions (AE) testing treats large, complex structures such as bridges and aircraft. This biennial conference of the European Working Group on Acoustic Emission (EWGAE) is a major international forum for dissemination of recent advances in AE, particularly applicable in mechanical and civil engineering. The editors, with the Cardiff School of Engineering and the U. of Southampton, UK, introduce 60 theoretical and empirical papers presented at the 2006 conference. Following the keynote address offering an American scientist's perspective on the field's early years, academic and industry researchers present the latest methodologies for evaluating the structural integrity of machinery and case studies of damaged structures. Illustrations feature testing apparatus. EWGAE committee members are listed. Co-published as Advanced Materials Research (2006), vols. 13-14",

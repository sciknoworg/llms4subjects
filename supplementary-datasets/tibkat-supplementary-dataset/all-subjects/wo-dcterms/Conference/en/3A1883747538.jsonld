                "This book offers a timely snapshot of research, technologies and best practices in the broad area of bioengineering and clinical engineering. Contributions report on advances in biomechanics, biomaterials, and tissue engineering, biosensors and instrumentation, biomedical signal processing, and rehabilitation engineering. Further, it covers topics relating to quality engineering and management of health services, and of engineering education. The book gathers selected, peer-reviewed contributions to the XXIII Argentinian Congress of Bioengineering and the XII Clinical Engineering Conference, both known under the acronym \u201cSABI 2022\u201d, held on September 13\u201316, 2022, in San Juan, Argentina, and organized by the Sociedad Argentina de Bioingenier\u00eda.",

                "The NATO sponsored Advanced Research Workshop on \"Concepts in Electron Correlation\" took place on the Croatian island of Hvar during the period from the 29th of September to the 3rd of October, 2002. The topic of electron correlation is a fundamental one in the field of condensed matter, and one that is being very actively studied both experimentally and theoretically at the present time. The manifestations of electron cor\u00ad relation are diverse, and play an important role in systems ranging from high temperature superconductors, heavy fermions, manganite compounds with colossal magnetoresistance, transition metal compounds with metal\u00ad insulator transitions, to mesoscopic systems and quantum dots. The aim of the workshop was to provide an opportunity for a dialogue between exper\u00ad imentalists and theoreticians to assess the current state of understanding, and to set an agenda for future work. There was also a follow-up workshop on the same topic where the presentations included more background and introductory material for younger researchers in the field. The papers presented in these proceedings clearly demonstrate the di\u00ad versity of current research on electron correlation. They show that real progress is being made in characterising systems experimentally and in developing theoretical approaches for a quantitative comparison with ex\u00ad periment. The more one learns, however, the more there is to understand, and many of the contributions help to map out the territory which has yet to be explored. We hope that the articles in this volume will be a stimulus for such future work."

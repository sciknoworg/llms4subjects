            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This special volume comprises 287 expertly refereed papers. The main theme covered is Materials and Manufacturing Technology; the main goal being to provide an international scientific forum for the exchange of new ideas in a number of fields, and to facilitate in-depth interaction via discussions with peers from around the world. Core areas of Materials and Manufacturing Technology, and multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary and practical aspects are covered, making this essential reading for anyone interested in these topics.  Two volumes present peer reviewed papers from ICMMT 2010, held in September in Chongqing, China, sponsored by the International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology. Here's a sampling of topics in the approximately 300 papers: urban low-carbon landscape construction, chemical and physical changes for dimensional stability of compressed wood, analysis of the health risk of volatile organic compounds of popular composite biomaterial by GC-MS, networked manufacturing system based on ASP and SQL server, effects of temperature and water immersion on the mechanical properties of coated fabrics, research on the rough cut of heavy pressure vessels, the development and application of smart garment materials, and shrinkage of full-scale girders cast with self-consolidating concrete. Obviously, the range of topics is very wide. Arrangement of the papers is according to no discernible logic, but a keyword index provides at least the semblance of a guide for those seeking particular content, and there is an author list",

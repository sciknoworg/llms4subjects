                "This book reports on innovative materials research with a special emphasis on methods, modeling, and simulation tools for analyzing material behavior, emerging materials, and composites, and their applications in the field of manufacturing. Chapters are based on contributions to the third International Conference on Advanced Materials Mechanics and Manufacturing, A3M2021, organized by the Laboratory of Mechanics, Modeling, and Manufacturing (LA2MP) of the National School of Engineers of Sfax, Tunisia and held online on March 25-27, 2021. They cover a variety of topics, spanning from experimental analysis of material plasticity and fatigue, numerical simulation of material behavior, and optimization of manufacturing processes, such as cutting and injection, among others. Offering a good balance of fundamental research and industrially relevant findings, they provide researchers and professionals with a timely snapshot of and extensive information on current developments in the field and a source of inspiration for future research and collaboration."

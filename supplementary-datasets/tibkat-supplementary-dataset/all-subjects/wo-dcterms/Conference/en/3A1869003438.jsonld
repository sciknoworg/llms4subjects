            "abstract": "This book offers a timely snapshot of innovative research and developments at the interface between manufacturing, materials and mechanical engineering, and quality assurance. It covers various manufacturing processes, such as grinding, boring, milling, broaching, coatings, including additive manufacturing. It focuses on cutting, abrasive, stamping-drawing processes, shot peening, and complex treatment. It describes temperature distribution, twisting deformation, defect formation process, failure analysis, as well as the convective heat exchange and non-uniform nanocapillary fluid cooling, highlighting the growing role of quality control, integrated management systems, and economic efficiency evaluation. It also covers vibration damping, dynamic behavior, failure probability, and strength performance methods for aviation, heterogeneous, permeable porous, and other types of materials. Gathering the best papers presented at the 4th Grabchenko's International Conference on Advanced Manufacturing Processes (InterPartner-2022), held in Odessa, Ukraine, on September 6-9, 2022, this book offers a timely overview and extensive information on trends and technologies in manufacturing, mechanical, and materials engineering, and quality assurance. It is also intended to facilitate communication and collaboration between different groups working on similar topics and to offer a bridge between academic and industrial researchers.",

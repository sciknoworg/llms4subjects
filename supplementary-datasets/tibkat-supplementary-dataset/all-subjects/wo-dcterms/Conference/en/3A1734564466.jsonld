            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The papers contained in this volume reflect the diverse nature of the field of Experimental Mechanics. They cover topics ranging from small-scale experimentation to the assessment of full-scale structures. Novel sensing and sensor technology is a major feature, as is the analysis of composite materials. The contributions come from both academia and industry, with over half of the them originating from outside the UK; thus mirroring the international flavour of the event. The contents are divided into: Component Analysis 1, Composite Structures and Materials, Defect and Damage Analysis, Materials Characterization 1, Impact, Materials Characterisation 2, Novel Sensor Technology 2, Component AnalysisThe work therefore offers an up-to-date overview of current experimental methods, as applied to mechanics. Papers from a September 2008 conference represent the diverse nature of the field of experimental mechanics. Written by international contributors in academia and industry, the papers cover the full range of the field, from small-scale experimentation to full-scale structures. Material is grouped in sections on novel sensor technology, component analysis, residual stress, composite structures and materials, defect and damage analysis, materials characterization, and impact. Some specific areas investigated include nonlinear stress and deformation behavior of composite sandwich beams, a neural network approach for locating multiple defects, first-order size effects in the mechanics of miniaturized components, and deformation evaluation of solder ball joints by electromotive force. Other topics include applications of power ultrasonics in engineering, and the application of digital image correlation for measuring residual stress by incremental hole drilling. B&w photos and images are included. The editor is affiliated with the University of Southampton, UK",

            "abstract": "This volume contains a collection of papers from International Conference \u201eWear Processes 2012\" which were held in \u015awinouj\u015bcie, Poland, from 12 to 14 of September 2012. The Conference is organized periodically and is a continuation of the seminars series concerning \"Testing and modelling of complex wear processes\", that are organized since 2003. The Initiator of the Conference is Jaros\u0142aw Chmiel, PhD. Eng. from Maritime University of Szczecin.The aim of the Conference is a creating a forum of information exchange for researchers dealing with issues of wear phenomena caused by more as one process acting on a material simultaneously, the subject somewhat neglected at most conferences focusing on wear problems.The main topics of the Conference are as follows:- fundamental problems of deterioration and wear of materials.- simple and complex deterioration processes.- hydrogen degradation of materials.- wear processes accelerated by the hydrogen degradation and corrosion.- modeling of wear processes.- causes of abnormally rapid of wear. Since 2010, the Conference is held under the auspices of the European Structural Integrity Society, Technical Committee TC10 \"Environmentally Assisted Cracking\". Keyword: Wear processes, tribology, corrosion, environmental protection, modelling of wear processes, hydrogen degradation Wear of industrial products is of upmost concern to researchers and practitioners. A particularly problematic, and relatively unstudied area, is the issue of the combined effect of more than one process working on a material simultaneously. The International Conference on Wear Processes 2012 convened in Swinoujscie, Poland from September 12-14 to allow researchers an opportunity to discuss just this problem. The proceedings from that conference are contained in this book, volume 225 in the \"Solid State Phenomena\" series. Papers cover a variety of topics including fundamental problems of deterioration and wear of materials, simple and complex deterioration processes, hydrogen degradation of materials, modeling of wear processes and more. \u2014 Applied sciences\u2014 Materials science\u2014 Solid state materials and hard matter",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This collection reflects the current worldwide state of knowledge concerning the latest scientific concepts and technological developments in the characterization, testing, mechanics, modelling, manufacturing and applications of various classes of composite materials and structures. It is also intended to promote the sharing of ideas and emerging technologies, as well as to foster R & D collaboration among academia, research institutions and the relevant industries. This special issue comprises papers covering the ever-widening advances in composite materials of recent years. The topics encompass bio-medical composites; bio-mimetic materials; composites for constructional applications; computational mechanics of composites; durability, NDE techniques and health monitoring; fracture, fatigue, impact, damage-mechanics; interphases; manufacturing processes; multi-functional composites; nano-composites and nano-mechanics; molecular dynamics simulations; natural fibres, green composites; off-shore, marine composites; polymers, metals, ceramic-matrix composites; reinforcements (textile, strands, mats); and technology-transfer. In order to emphasize the latest developments in the most dynamic composite technologies, three Special sections in the areas of Nanocomposites, Composites in Medicine and Smart Composites have been added.In addition, the collection includes the papers presented at the Special Mai Symposium which was held on the occasion of the 60th birthday of Professor Yiu-Wing Mai. Not to be missed. Organized by the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology, with help from three other Chinese institutions, ACCM is held every two years and is now in its fifth incarnation, attracting participation from an international roster of academics, researchers, and industry workers. The papers encompass topics pertaining to bio-medical composites, bio-mimetic materials, construction applications, computational mechanics, durability, NDE techniques, health monitoring, damage mechanics, nano-mechanics, natural fibers, and green composites, to name a few. Three sections in the areas of nanocomposites, medicine, and smart composites have been added. A special section honors the 60th birthday of Professor Yiu-Wiong Mai. The presentation is in two volumes, with indexing in the second",

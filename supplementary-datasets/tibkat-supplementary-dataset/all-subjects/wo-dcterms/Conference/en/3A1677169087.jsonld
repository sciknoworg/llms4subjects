                "These proceedings showcase the best papers selected from more than 500 submissions, and introduce readers to the latest research topics and developmental trends in the theory and application of MMESE. The integrated research topic Man\u2013Machine\u2013Environment System Engineering (MMESE) was first established in China by Professor Shengzhao Long in 1981, with direct support from one of the greatest modern Chinese scientists, Xuesen Qian. In a letter to Long from October 22nd, 1993, Qian wrote: \u201cYou have created a very important modern science and technology in China!\u201d MMESE studies the optimum combination of man\u2013machine\u2013environment systems. In this system, \u201cman\u201d refers to the people in the workplace (e.g. operators, decision-makers); \u201cmachine\u201d is the general name for any object controlled by man (including tools, machinery, computers, systems and technologies), and \u201cenvironment\u201d describes the specific working conditions under which man and machine interact (e.g. temperature, noise, vibration, hazardous gases, etc.). The three main goals of optimizing man\u2013machine\u2013environment systems are to ensure safety, efficiency and economy. These proceedings present interdisciplinary studies on concepts and methods from physiology, psychology, system engineering, computer science, environmental science, management, education, and other related disciplines. They offer a valuable resource for all researchers and professionals whose work involves interdisciplinary areas touching on MMESE subjects"

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The theme of this collection was \"Innovation and Development of Surface Engineering Towards a Conservation-Minded Society\"; a timely reminder of the obligation of advanced technologies to commit to energy & resource saving and environmental protection. Surface engineering must play a more-and-more important role in energy-saving, materials-saving and environmental protection in the coming years obey the 4R (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle, Remanufacture) rule and contribute to development of the world economy. This collection of 201 peer-reviewed papers is grouped into seven sections: I. Thermal Spray Technology, II. Vapor Deposition Technologies, III. Electrodeposition and Electroless Deposition, IV. Energetic Beams and Plasma Surface Treatments, V. Wear and Corrosion Behavior of Engineering Surfaces, VI. Functional Films and Coatings and VII. Surface Machining and Mechanical Processing Technologies.This work therefore offers valuable insights into the scientific & technological achievements already made in this field and into the important progress still being made. A July 2007 conference gathered the surface engineering community and provided a forum for specialists, scholars, and engineers in research, teaching, and industry. This collection of 201 peer-reviewed international papers from the conference is grouped into seven sections on thermal spray technology, vapor deposition technologies, electrodeposition and electroless deposition, energetic beams and plasma surface treatments, wear and corrosion behavior of engineering surfaces, functional films and coatings, and surface machining and mechanical processing technologies. Some areas described are remanufacturing and automatic surface engineering technology, plasma transferred arc powder surfacing technology of thrust face, cerium- phytic acid passivation treatment on galvanized steel, supersaturated surface engineering S-phase materials, and preparation of epoxy modified organosilicone high-temperature resistance coatings. Other subjects are surface grafting modification of silk fibroin by atom transfer radical polymerization, superficial optimization of microcapsule, and figuration control of deposits in friction surfacing",

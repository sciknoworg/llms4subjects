            "abstract": "The present volumes provide up-to-date and state-of-the art knowledge of the manufacturing science and engineering, including: Non-ferrous Metal Materials and Its Alloys, Iron, Steel and Its Alloys, Composites, Micro/Nano Materials, Ceramic, Functional Materials, Surface Engineering/Coatings, Materials Forming and Manufacturing Processes, Materials Machining, Welding & Joining, CAD/CAE/CAM, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Manufacturing Processes, Products Design, Manufacture and Industry etc. The volumes will not only provide the readers a broad overview of the latest advances but also provide the researchers a valuable summary and reference in this field.  This four-volume set presents peer-reviewed papers from the March 2013 Fourth International Conference on Manufacturing Science and Engineering, held in China. Many papers are illustrated with b&w micro images. In Volume 1, papers are grouped in sections on non-ferrous materials and their alloys; iron, steel, and their alloys; composites; micro/nano materials and nanotechnologies; ceramics; optical, electronic, and magnetic materials; functional materials; and building materials, construction, soil behavior, architecture, and urban and land planning applications. Volume 2 presents papers in chapters on energy materials; environmental friendly materials and treatment and removal technology; earthquake resistant structures, materials, and design; biomaterials and biotechnology; chemical materials and chemical technology; polymeric materials; thin films and technology; and mechanical behavior, fracture, and fatigue. Volume 3 presents work on tooling, testing, and evaluation of materials; structural strength and robustness; theory and application of friction and wear; surface engineering and coatings; materials forming and manufacturing processes; materials machining; and welding and joining. Finally, Volume 4 gathers work on CAD, CAE, and CAM; modeling of manufacturing processes; machining, inspection, and control technologies; product design and manufacture; laser processing technology; and mineral materials, mining, and mineral process engineering",

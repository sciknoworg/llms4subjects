                "The Fourth Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2000) was held at the Keihanna-Plaza, Kyoto, Japan, April 18 - 20, 2000. PAKDD 2000 provided an international forum for researchers and applica\u00ad tion developers to share their original research results and practical development experiences. A wide range of current KDD topics were covered including ma\u00ad chine learning, databases, statistics, knowledge acquisition, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, soft computing, and high performance computing. It followed the success of PAKDD 97 in Singapore, PAKDD 98 in Austraha, and PAKDD 99 in China by bringing together participants from universities, indus\u00ad try, and government from all over the world to exchange problems and challenges and to disseminate the recently developed KDD techniques. This PAKDD 2000 proceedings volume addresses both current issues and novel approaches in regards to theory, methodology, and real world application. The technical sessions were organized according to subtopics such as Data Mining Theory, Feature Selection and Transformation, Clustering, Application of Data Mining, Association Rules, Induction, Text Mining, Web and Graph Mining. Of the 116 worldwide submissions, 33 regular papers and 16 short papers were accepted for presentation at the conference and included in this volume. Each submission was critically reviewed by two to four program committee members based on their relevance, originality, quality, and clarity."

            "abstract": "The aim of this special volume is to give an overview of the historical background and present status of eco-materials processing and design for materials research, and to foresee future trends in the field. Serious global and environmental problems have led the materials manufacturing industries to monitor closely the formation and accumulation of carbon dioxide and other deleterious gases in the atmosphere, as well to reduce raw materials use and energy consumption and limit other factors which reflect the environmental impact of the industry.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS). The papers contained within cover topics such as room- and low-temperature synthesis, low-energy processing, aqueous synthesis and processing, the re-use and recycling of waste materials and the elimination of such hazardous materials as cadmium, mercury, lead and chromium which are restricted in use, in electronic components and automobile parts, under the European Committee RoHS guidelines. It is shown how the materials industries have addressed environmental concerns by investing in research on various novel materials in order to ensure safer and cleaner systems and processes.This thorough coverage will certainly make the book essential reading for all of those who care about conserving the world for the benefit of future generations. Addressing environmental concern within the materials manufacturing industries, the January 2009 symposium explores low-temperature synthesis, low-energy processing, aqueous synthesis and processing, the reuse and recycling of waste materials, and the elimination of such hazardous materials as cadmium, mercury, lead, and 6-valence chromium. The Asian contributors share recent research on high-performance materials, hybrid composites, nanostructure materials, biomaterials, photocatalysts, multifunction of materials, and porous materials. Topics of the 195 papers include adding gneiss to asphalt concrete mixtures, characterization of power plant bottom ash, the effects of filler on the properties of silicone rubber, the fabrication of clay foam ceramics, and the use of recycled calcium slag for clean steel refining",

                "This book focuses on theory, practice and applications in the broad areas of advanced computing techniques and intelligent engineering. This book includes 74 scholarly articles which were accepted for presentation from 294 submissions in the 5th ICACIE during 25\u201327 June 2020 at Universit\u00e9 des Mascareignes (UdM), Mauritius, in collaboration with Rama Devi Women\u2019s University, Bhubaneswar, India, and S\u2018O\u2019A Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar, India. This book brings together academicians, industry persons, research scholars and students to share and disseminate their knowledge and scientific research work related to advanced computing and intelligent engineering. It helps to provide a platform to the young researchers to find the practical challenges encountered in these areas of research and the solutions adopted. The book helps to disseminate the knowledge about some innovative and active research directions in the field of advanced computing techniques and intelligent engineering, along with some current issues and applications of related topics. ."

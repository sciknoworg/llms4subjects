            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The book covers a broad range of topics regarding the assessment and conservation of timber structures, with papers subdivided into ten themes: Assessment and conservation; Timber grading; Assessment by non-destructive methods and survey techniques; Assessment by testing and modeling; Reinforcement and treatment of timber elements; Strengthening of connections; Upgrading of timber structures; Monitoring; Learning from case studies; Codes and guidelines. The book will be of valuable use and precious help for consultants, specialists, practitioners as well as for researchers and scholars for what concerns assessment, conservation, repair and monitoring of timber structures and wood artifacts.  The conference is held in light of economic, environmental, and safety reasons for assessing the structural health of wooden structures and extending their service life if possible. The 138 papers cover assessment and conservation, timber grading, assessment by non-destructive methods and survey techniques, testing and modeling, reinforcing and treating timber elements, strengthening connections, upgrading timber structures, monitoring, learning from case studies, and codes and guidelines. Among the topics are database research and development for visualizing invisible parts of wooden houses in Japan, a microwave reflectometric tool for the non-destructive assessment of decay in historic buildings, assessing damage and estimating residual service life of cracked timber beams, some Portuguese case studies of solutions for rehabilitating wooden structures, the influence of faulty 19th-century technical solutions on a work of 18th-century rafter framing as exemplified by a church in Nowy Kosciol in Poland, and classification criteria for the seismic vulnerability of timber roof structures",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This collection covers the many activities, relevant to the damage assessment of engineering structures and systems, including the signal processing of sensor measurements and analytical techniques, as well as experimental case studies. The themes addressed reflect the current intense interest in the wider field of damage assessment; in particular, it is interesting to observe the sharp rise in the popularity of acoustic emission methods; as reflected by the high number of papers in this area. A significant proportion of the book is dedicated to signal processing and to computational methods.Among the topics covered are: Structural integrity and damage assessment, Advanced methods of NDT, Developments in signal processing and algorithms, System diagnosis and prognosis, Damage mechanisms, Fatigue damage, Damage location and quantification, Sensors and measurement procedures, Condition monitoring, Real-time process monitoring, Practical applications and case studies.Altogether, this will make this work essential reading for anyone with an interest in this field. This collection of papers from a June 2007 conference covers damage assessment of engineering structures and systems, including signal processing of sensor measurements and analytical techniques, and presents experimental case studies. A significant portion of the book is devoted to signal processing and to computational methods. Among the topics covered are structural integrity and damage assessment, advanced prognosis, damage mechanisms, fatigue damage, damage location and quantification, sensors and measurement procedures, condition monitoring, real-time process monitoring, and practical applications. Specific subjects include experimental model analysis for damage detection of buildings via Gabor transform techniques, seismic damage quantification in a three-story laboratory structure, fatigue prevention on turbine blades, and system fatigue damage reliability assessment of railway riveted bridges",

                "This book contains selected peer-reviewed papers of the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) symposium 'Mycotoxins and phycotoxins'. These symposia are the principal international interdisciplinary conventions focusing on occurrence, advances in determination, toxicology and exposure management of these bio-contaminants. The chapters are organized in sections that include up to date overviews of current mycotoxin and phycotoxin issues. Advances in analytical techniques using rapid screening tools, high-sensitivity instrumental methods and their combinations, applied for single and multi-toxin determinations, are highlighted in a specific section of the book. Identification of requisite agronomic factors and pre-harvest forecasting for strategic intervention are part of a treatise on exposure management. Since the inception more than 30 years ago, this IUPAC symposia series has grown in scope, scientific novelty and value"

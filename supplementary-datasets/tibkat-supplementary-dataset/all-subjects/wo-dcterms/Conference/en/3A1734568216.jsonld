            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Advanced Materials and Processing are important areas of research in Engineering Science and Technology, which have to focus on bridging the critical gap between researchers and engineers in order to shape the new world. Advanced Materials and Processing play an increasingly important role in the global economy and in daily life. Researchers and engineers strive to develop new devices and processes, using mathematical and analytical tools, in order to create technologies for a rapidly expanding range of materials and manufacturing processes. A large proportion of the present papers addressed current scientific research and provided solutions to industrial problems; thereby creating an environment of mutual interest to industry and academia. The papers are grouped into 10 chapters: 1. Forming Processes, 2. Casting, Joining and Related Processes, 3. Materials, 4. Materials Removal Processes, 5. High Energy Beam Removal Process, 6. Precision Engineering and Nano-Technology, 7. Surface Engineering, 8. Computer-Aided Engineering, 9. Green Manufacturing and Management, 10. Others. This comprehensive coverage will be much appreciated by readers.  The 380 papers presented during the October 2009 conference are arranged according to forming processes, casting and joining, material removal processes, laser machining, nanotechnology, surface engineering, CAD/CAM, and green manufacturing. Several papers from the University of Tehran study aluminum-steel composite plates welded explosively, hot extrusion of AA6061/SiC composites, rolling aluminum after twist extrusion, and forward flow forming of stainless steel. Four papers from the International Islamic University Malaysia report on the effects of adding titanium powder to the surface of steel before TIG melting. Other topics include reverse engineering of motorcycle chain, fabrication of silicon nanopillar sheet for cell cultures dishes, the etching rate of machinable glass ceramic, and the development of vibration suppression devices from smart fluids.

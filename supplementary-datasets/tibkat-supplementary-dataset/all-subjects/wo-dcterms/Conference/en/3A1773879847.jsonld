                "The Second International Workshop on Cooperative Internet Computing (CIC2002) has brought together researchers, academics, and industry practitioners who are involved and interested in the development of advanced and emerging cooperative computing technologies. Cooperative computing is an important computing paradigm to enable different parties to work together towards a pre\u00ad defined non-trivial goal. It encompasses important technological areas like computer supported cooperative work, workflow, computer assisted design and concurrent programming. As technologies continue to advance and evolve, there is an increasing need to research and develop new classes of middlewares and applications to leverage on the combined benefits of Internet and web to provide users and programmers with highly interactive and robust cooperative computing environment. It is the aim of this forum to promote close interactions and exchange of ideas among researchers, academics and practitioners on the state-of-the\u00ad art researches in all of these exciting areas. We have partnered with Kluwer Acedamic Press this year to bring to you a book compilation of the papers that were presented at the CIC2002 workshop. The importance of the research area is reflected both in the quality and quantity of the submitted papers, where each paper was reviewed by at least three PC members. As a result, we were able to only accept 14 papers for full presentation at the workshop, while having to reject several excellent papers due to the limitations of the program schedule.",

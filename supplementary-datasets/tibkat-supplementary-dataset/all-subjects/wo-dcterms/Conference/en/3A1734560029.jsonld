            "abstract": "The 2nd International Conference on Advanced Engineering and Technology (ICAET 2015) would take place in Incheon, South Korea, December 11-13, 2015. This conference is sponsored by Incheon Disaster Prevention Research Center (IDPRC) in INU. The ICAET 2015 is an annual international conference aimed at presenting current research being carried out in the fields of materials, structures and mechanical engineering. The idea of the conference is for the scientists, scholars, engineers and students from universities, research institutes and industries all around the world to present on-going research activities. This allows for the free exchange of ideas and challenges among the conference participants and encourages future collaboration between members of these groups. The conference will also foster cooperation among organizations and researchers involved in the merging fields and will provide in-depth technical presentations with abundant opportunities for individual discussions with the presenters.The book is a collection of accepted papers. All these accepted papers were subjected to strict peer-reviewing by 2-3 experts referees including preliminary review process conducted by conference editors and committee members before there publication by Trans Tech Publication.

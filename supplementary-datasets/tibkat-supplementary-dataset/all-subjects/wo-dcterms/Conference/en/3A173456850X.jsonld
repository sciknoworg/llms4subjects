            "title": "Coupled Problems and Multi-Physics : Special topic volume with invited peer reviewed papers only",
            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).The objective of Coupled Problems is to present and discuss the state-of-the-art mathematical models, numerical methods and computational techniques used for solving coupled problems of a multidisciplinary nature in science and engineering. The goal of the conference was to take a step forward, in the formulation and solution of real-life problems, with a multidisciplinary vision; accounting for all of the complex couplings involved in the physical description of the problem. Simulation of multifaceted physics problems is a common task in applied research and industry. Often a suitable solver is built by connecting together several single-aspect solvers into a network. In this special issue, research in various fields was selected for consideration: adaptive methodology for multi-physics solvers, multi-physics phenomena and coupled-field problems leading to computationally intensive structural analysis. The strategies which are used to keep these problems computationally affordable are of special interest, and make this an essential reference-work.  Containing only invited peer reviewed papers, this collection of twelve contributions on coupled problems and simulation of multi-physics issues contains frequent figures and equations. Although this area of research has traditionally been associated with aircraft engineering, several of the pieces cover other areas such as design optimization, drilling fluids, and river sedimentation",

            "abstract": "\"Domestic animals contaminate recreational waters and drinking-water sources with excreta and pathogens; but this threat to public health is inadequately understood and is insufficiently addressed in regulations.  More than 85% of the world's faecal wastes is from domestic animals such as poultry, cattle, sheep and pigs.  These animals harbor zoonotic pathogens that are transported in the environment by water, especially runoff.  However little information exists on health effects associated with exposure to this potential hazard to human health; and water standards focused on control of human faecal contamination do reflect the contribution of non-human faecal contamination to risk.  Does compliance with current monitoring practices using microbial indicators provide protection against animal and bird sources of fecal contamination?  Prepared with contributions from a group of international experts, this book considers microbial contamination from domestic animal and bird sources and explores the health hazards associated with this microbial contamination and approaches to protecting public health.  This book will be of interest to regulators with responsibility for recreational waters, drinking-water quality and water reuse; policymakers working in water quality, public health and agriculture; decision makers responsible for livestock management; and scientists and practitioners concerned with many affected subjects.\"--",

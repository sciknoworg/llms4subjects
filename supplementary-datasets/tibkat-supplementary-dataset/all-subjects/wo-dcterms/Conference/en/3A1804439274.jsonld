                "This book presents the latest advances and research achievements in the fields of autonomous robots and intelligent systems, presented at the IAS-16 conference, conducted virtually in Singapore, from 22 to 25 June 2021. IAS is a common platform for an exchange and sharing of ideas among the international scientific research and technical community on some of the main trends of robotics and autonomous systems: navigation, machine learning, computer vision, control, and robot design\u2014as well as a wide range of applications. IAS-16 reflects the rise of machine learning and deep learning developments in the robotics field, as employed in a variety of applications and systems. All contributions were selected using a rigorous peer-reviewed process to ensure their scientific quality. Despite the challenge of organising a conference during a pandemic, the IAS biennial conference remains an essential venue for the robotics and autonomous systems community ever since its inception in 1986.

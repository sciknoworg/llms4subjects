                "This book provides readers with a timely snapshot of ergonomics research and methods applied to the design, development and evaluation, of products, systems and services. It gathers theoretical contributions, case studies and reports on technical interventions focusing on a better understanding of human machine interaction, and user experience for improving product design. The book covers a wide range of established and emerging topics in user-centered design, relating to design for special populations, design education, workplace assessment and design, anthropometry, ergonomics of buildings and urban design, sustainable design, as well as visual ergonomics and interdisciplinary research and practices, among others. Based on the AHFE 2021 International Conference on Ergonomics in Design, held virtually on 25\u201329 July, 2021, from USA, the book offers a thought-provoking guide for both researchers and practitioners in human-centered design and related fields."

            "abstract": "This up-to-date collection, \"Eco-Materials Processing and Design IX\", covers \u2013 on a global scale \u2013 the outstanding advances made in investigating, producing and using eco-materials. It furnishes materials scientists and end-users with a valuable source of information and new concepts covering the complete spectrum of ecology, eco-materials, nano-materials, bio-materials, recycling, environmental protection and energy conversion related materials. The volume can be divided into five sections on the basis of the subjects considered by the manuscripts. The first section deals with photocatalysts for air pollution, water pollution, deodorization, self-cleaning, power light sources, and standardization of the methodology of photocatalytic reactivity. The second section treats nano-structured materials. The third section covers the use of non-hazardous components as substitutes for traditionally-used hazardous components, as well the treatment of waste materials. The fourth section presents the manufacturing of hybrid materials using more environmentally-friendly processing. The final section describes eco-materials design and processing.This thorough coverage will certainly make the book essential reading for all of those who care about conserving the world for future generations. With over 150 papers from the international symposium held in January 2008 in Changwon City, Korea, these proceedings cover a wide range of topics concerning sustainable and environmentally responsible design and manufacturing. Here researchers report on their work in the use of \"eco-materials\" such as recyclable hybrid and nano-materials, energy-conserving materials, photo-catalysts, and non-hazardous components. They also explain their research in sustainable energy sources, alternative fuels and sustainable transport, as well as experiments and programs that treat waste materials and result in environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and energy conservation. The papers include new findings on the mechanical properties of ceramic composites and other materials, and reports on environmentally friendly coatings, uses for incinerator residue and plaster molds, and new production methods for foams",

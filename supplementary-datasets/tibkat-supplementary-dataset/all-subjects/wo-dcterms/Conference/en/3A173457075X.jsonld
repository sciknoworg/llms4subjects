            "abstract": "These selected papers offer an overview of current knowledge in the fields of Renewable Energy and Building Energy Saving; Indoor Environments; City Ecological Environments; Water Purification and Wastewater Treatment; Air Environment Control and Architectural Environment Improvement Techniques; Road and Railway Engineering; Transportation Planning, Construction and Operation Organization; Bridge Engineering; Traffic Control and Information Technology; Carrier Operation Engineering. The volumes provide a comprehensive picture of the situation world wide.  Selected peer-reviewed papers from a May 2012 conference are collected in this four-volume set. Volume 1 contains chapters on renewable energy, the indoor environment, the urban environment, water purification and wastewater treatment. Some specific topics addressed include green residential interior design, indoor formaldehyde treatment, shade in city design, and the effect of deicing salts in urban soils and roadside trees. Volume 2 presents chapters on air environmental control and architectural environment improvement techniques; environmental chemistry, engineering, and environmental protection; and road and railway engineering. Some subjects include load transfer mechanisms of embankment support by sparse piles, and grading features of bituminous steel-slag mixtures. Volume 3 provides chapters on transportation planning and construction, and bridge engineering, while Volume 4 covers traffic control and information technology, and carrier operation engineering. Topics dealt with in those sections include a model for coordination among regional rail transit and urban trains and buses, dynamic response of bridges subjected to moving harmonic loads, and a heat pump system for an electric vehicle",

            "abstract": "In this book, scientists from various disciplines address the advances in seafood research with respect to quality, safety, consumer\u2019s demands and processing of wild and farmed fish. The nutritional properties of marine lipids and lipid oxidation from model systems to seafood are presented. Several contributions on the effects of natural anti-oxidants to prevent oxidation are also included. Effects of dietary factors on muscle tissue quality, pre-rigor processing and brining of farmed cod are covered. The development of rigor mortis and the quality of muscle in relation to commercial and experimental slaughter techniques are also discussed. Consumer\u2019s knowledge, perception and need for information about seafood are discussed. Topics such as shelf life and microbial quality of seafood are covered in a range of contributions. Inactivation of micro organisms or biopreservation of seafood are included. Attention is paid to the development of the Quality Index Method for the evaluation of the quality of fresh fish and products. The characterisation and the quality of processed by-products are also presented. The presence of trace elements and organic contaminants in variety of seafood products is highlighted. Finally, several contributions regarding advanced methodologies to determine the quality of seafood are presented. This book will be of interest to anybody concerned with quality and safety of fish throughout the entire chain from catch to consumer",

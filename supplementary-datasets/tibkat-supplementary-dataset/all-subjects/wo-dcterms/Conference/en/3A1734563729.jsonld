            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The collection coveres all aspects of fracture and strength of materials and structure, particularly of advanced materials ranging from nanoscale to macroscale and modern structural systems ranging from large scale plants to micro- devices. The topics cover the major aspects of fracture and strength: Fatigue and Fracture, Strength / Hardening and Toughening, High Temperature Materials and Strength, Deformation Behavior, Friction and Wear, Simulation of Fatigue and Fracture, Damage Mechanics, Advanced Composite Materials, Advanced Ceramic Materials, New Structural Metal Materials, Surface Engineering, Welding and Joining Technology, Nano- and Bio- Materials, Non-Destructive Evaluation, Reliability and its application, Design and Assessment of Structural Components, Package Materials and related Issues of IT.It is believed that these volumes represent the state-of-the-art of research in the field of fracture and strength of materials and structures. Held in November of 2006, the Asian Pacific Conference Fracture and Strength covered aspects of fracture and strength of materials, paying particular attention to advanced materials ranging from nanoscale to macroscale and modern structural systems ranging from large scale plants to micro-devices. Edited by Zhou (Harbin Institute of Technology, China), Tu (East China U. of Science and Technology, China) and Xie (U. of Science and Technology Beijing, China), these four volumes collect 756 papers selected after peer review from the approximately 1300 submitted. The papers are organized into sections on fatigue and fracture, strength/hardening and toughening, high temperature materials and strength, deformation behavior, friction and wear, simulation of fatigue and fracture, damage mechanics, advanced composite materials, advanced ceramic materials, new structural metal materials, welding and joining technology, nano and bio materials, non-destructive evaluation, reliability and its application, design and assessment of structural components, and package materials and related issues of information technology",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This special volume comprises 85 refereed papers. The selection of the papers was based upon the recommendations of the reviewers and the discretion of the editors. In most cases, the accepted papers were further polished to improve their readability. The resultant works cover a wide range of topics covering the processing, microstructure and properties of a number of advanced engineering and functional materials including: metallic materials, polymeric materials, composite materials with polymer, metal or ceramic matrices, and other functional materials.While all of the papers make original contributions to the field of materials science and engineering, a considerable number of them report and discuss the findings of particularly novel studies.This all makes for an especially stimulating treatment of the subject. Revised papers from a December 2006 conference cover a range of topics connected to the processing, microstructure, and properties of advanced engineering and functional materials such as metallic materials, polymeric materials, composite materials with polymer, metal, or ceramic matrices, and other functional materials. Some specific topics covered include enhancing fatigue properties of nanostructured metals and alloys, a novel process for lowering the cost of titanium, syntactic foams consolidated with starch, and synthesis and characterization of titania nanotubes. Other subjects include environmentally intelligent biocomposites, hemp fiber reinforced poly(lactic acid) composites, and a novel nano-water- purifying material. The readership for the book includes all those in the international materials research and development community. Zhang is affiliated with the University of Waikato, New Zealand",

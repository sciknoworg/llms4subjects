            "abstract": "This book offers a timely snapshot of innovative research and developments at the interface between manufacturing, materials and mechanical engineering, and quality assurance. It covers a wide range of manufacturing processes, such as grinding, boring, milling, turning, woodworking, coatings, including additive manufacturing. It focuses on laser, ultrasonic, and combined laser\u2013ultrasonic hardening treatments, and dispersion hardening. It describes tribology and functional analysis of coatings, separation, purification and filtration processes, as well as ecological recirculation and electrohydraulic activation, highlighting the growing role of digital twins, optimization and lifecycle management methods, and quality inspection processes. It also covers cutting-edge heat and mass transfer technologies and energy management methods. Gathering the best papers presented at the 3rd Grabchenko\u2019s International Conference on Advanced Manufacturing Processes (InterPartner-2021), held in Odessa, Ukraine, on September 7\u201310, 2021, this book offers a timely overview and extensive information on trends and technologies in manufacturing, mechanical, and materials engineering, and quality assurance. It is also intended to facilitate communication and collaboration between different groups working on similar topics and to offer a bridge between academic and industrial researchers.",

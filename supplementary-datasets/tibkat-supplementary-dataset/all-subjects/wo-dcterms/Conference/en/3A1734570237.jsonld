            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).EDFGC is an international conference series covering research and development in the fields of textile dyeing/finishing and green chemistry. With its theme of \"Innovation, Eco-Textile and Sustainability\", the 2011 conference provided a platform for the presentation of research findings, the exchange of innovative ideas and the seeking-out of opportunities for collaboration, in the above fields, among both academics and industrialists all over the world. The proceedings of EDFGC 2011 include Eco-Dyeing & Finishing, Functional Textiles, Green Chemistry and Functional Chemicals, Pollution Control and Energy Conservation, Fundamental Research and Test & Characterization.  The conference was organized by and held at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, which has had a textile department for over 110 years. The theme of this year was innovation, eco-textiles, and sustainability, and some 150 papers describe research findings and ideas regarding textile dyeing and finishing using environmentally friendly methods. The topics include dyeing properties of natural food pigments on cotton fabric, the effect of cellulase hydrolysis on dyeing properties of linen, applying vitamin E microcapsules to textiles, the technique and effect of a wash-and-wear finish on bast fabric, synthesizing a flame retardant containing nitrogen-phosphor and its application to silk fabric, the advance treatment of textile wastewater for reuse by ozonation-biological and membrane processes, the effect of a high-voltage electrostatic field on water performance, and the enzymatic preparation of nanocrystalline cellulose from bamboo fibers",

            "abstract": "This special issue contains the proceedings of a joint meeting of the 5th International Symposium on Silicon Science and the 1st International Conference on Advanced Micro-Device Engineering (ISSS & AMDE 2009), organized by the International Education and Research Center for Silicon Science and the Advanced Technology Research Center, Gunma University, held on the 10th and 11th of December 2009 in Kiryu, Japan. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The scope of these proceedings encompasses: \"Materials Science,\" \"Chemical Science and Technology,\" \"Nano-Science and Technology,\" \"Photonics Devices and Technology,\" \"Novel Measurement and System Technology,\" and \"Information and Communication Engineering.\" This work thus constitutes an essential guide to the current thinking in this subject area. The 44 papers cover material science, chemical science and technology, nano-science and technology, photonics device and technology, novel measurement and system technology, and information and communication engineering. The topics include the ferromagnetic resonance frequency of single-layer magnetic metal films with lattice distortions, the nano-platelet structure of clay materials observed by atomic force microscope, a prototype of a frame-type cantilever for biosensor and femtogram detection, designing and fabricating a novel photonic crystal waveguide consisting of SiO2 layers implanted with silicon ions, a novel thermoelectric system with conductive metal rods and its effective Seebeck coefficients, and the architecture of a wideband high-efficiency envelope tracking power amplifier for a base station",

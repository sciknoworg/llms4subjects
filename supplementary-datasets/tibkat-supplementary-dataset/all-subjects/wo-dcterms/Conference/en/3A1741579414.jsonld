                "This book provides a comprehensive analysis of Japan\u2019s Asian diplomacy under Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe. Under the Kantei-centred policymaking system, Shinz\u014d Abe has implemented assertive foreign policies with a slogan of \u2018diplomacy taking a panoramic perspective of the world\u2019. The analyses in the book cover the traditional and emerging fields of national security and international political economy. While its empirical examination is based on field-specific research, it also incorporates the analysis of Japan\u2019s bilateral relations with China, the US, India, and others. In addition, the book provides a solid, theory-driven analysis of Japan\u2019s external policy and relations. In an independent chapter, this work sets up integrative theoretical frameworks for empirical analyses by relying on key concepts drawn from the three international relations theories of realism, liberalism and constructivism. Going forward, research in this book also explores the development of key regional affairs. Maritime security and space security are two of major security-related affairs, in which the states in East Asia and the Asia-Pacific have to engage, including the development of the TPP (TPP-11) and RCEP, as well as infrastructure development and development cooperation, which are crucial in relation to China\u2019s initiatives in the BRI and AIIB. Lastly, the book provides valuable references to regionalism in East Asia and the Asia-Pacific by analyzing regional integration/cooperation through free trade agreements and the development of regional connectivity. This includes the evolution of cooperation and conflict within key regional frameworks such as the East Asia Summit and APEC, as well as key regional visions such as the Free and Open Indo-Pacific. It also takes into account the possible influence of ideational factors such as norms, principles, and rules on the development of regional cooperation. Hidetaka Yoshimatsu is Professor of Politics and International Relations at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, Japan. He has published articles that focus on Japan\u2019s foreign policy and regionalism in Asia in numerous journals, including Pacific Review, Asian Survey, Journal of Contemporary China, and New Political Economy.",

The first section of the book focuses on Aerodynamics/Aeroacoustics, comprising eight papers that delve into the intricate relationship between fluid flow and aerodynamic performance. The second section explores the dynamics of Bluff/Moving Bodies through four insightful papers. Bubbly Flows, the subject of the third section, is examined through four papers. Moving on, the fourth section is dedicated to Combustion and Reactive Flows, presenting two papers that focus on the complex dynamics of combustion processes and the interactions between fluids and reactive species. Convection and Heat/Mass Transfer are the central themes of the fifth section, which includes three papers. These contributions explore the fundamental aspects of heat and mass transfer in fluid flows, addressing topics such as convective heat transfer, natural convection, and mass transport phenomena. The sixth section covers Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification, featuring two papers that highlight the importance of incorporating data into fluid dynamic models and quantifying uncertainties associated with these models. The subsequent sections encompass a wide range of topics, including Environmental and Industrial Applications, Flow Separation, LES Fundamentals and Modelling, Multiphase Flows, and Numerics and Methodology. These sections collectively present a total of 23 papers that explore different facets of fluid dynamics, contributing to the advancement of the field and its practical applications.",

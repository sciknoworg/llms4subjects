            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This collection of over 500 peer-reviewed papers presents new research results on environment-friendly materials and environmental management. It aims to bring together researchers, developers and users from around the world, working in both industry and academia, in order to share state-of-the-art results, to explore new areas of research and development and to discuss the emerging issues facing environment-friendly materials and environmental management. The work presents important new perspectives on this ever more essential field.  Three volumes, designated as \"parts,\" contain the proceedings of the July 2010 conference (EMEM) held in Harbin, China\u2014a conference sponsored by China's Northeast Forestry University and the Information Technology & Industrial Engineering Research Center (Hong Kong). Out of 985 submissions (from six countries or regions), 502 were selected for publication, along with invited keynote speeches. Arrangement is in two sections pertaining to environment management, and to materials, and there's a keyword index for subject access\u2014but the papers themselves are highly specific and cover a wide range of topics; researchers seeking something specific will probably need to access material initially via the online version. A light sampling of topics: factor analysis of mining waste land development; reducing plastic debris in the Pacific Ocean; biogenic volatile organic compounds from ginkgo; algae removal by microwave irradiation; bioremediation removal of chloroform in groundwater; outside flow field characteristic of biological carriers; the impact of fires and fire operations on the environment; evaluation models of water resources carrying capacity in the Manas River basin; treatment of ammonia-rich swine wastewater; solar clothing; compounds study of waste PC main-board pyrolysis; fractal theory in wood science research; structure design of railway sleeper composites; and legislation on agro-eco-environment in China",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Neutron and synchrotron radiation are novel and powerful tools for stress evaluation, and are widely applied to fundamental studies in materials science and engineering, and in various industrial fields. This volume brings together the up-to-date knowledge of scientists from the academic world and industry in order to address specific topics concerning the evaluation of stresses and related phenomena using neutrons, synchrotron radiation and X-rays. Many of the presentations on stress-testing deal with samples of up to 0.5m line-pipe. Many applications of micro-beam X-ray methods are described, ranging from intragranular stress fluctuations within a grain (attributed to dislocations) to stresses in interconnects on chips. Simultaneous evaluation of tomographic and stress measurements of the same sample was shown to provide extremely clear insights into the nature and cause of damage. A major advance in the simulation of stress and strain at the mesoscopic scale has been achieved using the extended elasto-plastic self-consistent model. Such discoveries, and many others, will make this an important reference work for anyone who uses these techniques.  A collection of peer-reviewed papers presented at the 5th International Conference on Mechanical Stress Evaluation by Neutrons and Synchrotron Radiation held in Mito, Japan in 2009, this book gives extensive coverage to stress testing in line pipes up to 0.5 m, as well as the use of microbeam x-ray methods",

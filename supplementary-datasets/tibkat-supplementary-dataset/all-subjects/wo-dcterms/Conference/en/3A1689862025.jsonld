            "abstract": "\"The development and managing of technologies and operations is key to the success of all types of manufacturing business. This book presents the proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Manufacturing Research (ICMR 2019), held in Belfast, UK, from 10 - 12 September 2019. ICMR has been the UK's main manufacturing research conference for 34 years and an international conference since 2003. It brings together researchers, academics and industrialists to share their vision, knowledge and experience and discuss emerging trends and new challenges in manufacturing research. The conference theme of ICMR2019 was smart manufacturing, and the book includes the 84 papers presented at the conference (representing an acceptance rate of 69%). These have been divided into 13 parts, which cover topics ranging from robot automation and machine processes, to design and innovation management and product optimization. Providing an overview of current trends and developments, the book will be of interest to all those whose work involves manufacturing processes\"--",

                "The 3rd International Workshop on Software Engineering and Middleware {SEM 2002) was held May 20-21, 2002, in Orlando, Florida, as a co-located event of the 2002 International Conference on Software Engineering. The workshop attracted 30 participants from academic and industrial institutions in many countries. Twenty-seven papers were submitted, of which 15 were accepted to create a broad program covering the topics of architectures, specification, components and adaptations, technologies, and services. The focus of the workshop was on short presentations, with substantial dis\u00ad cussions afterwards. Thus, we decided to include in this proceedings also a short summary of every technical session, which was written by some of the partici\u00ad pants at the workshop. The workshop invited one keynote speaker, Bobby Jadhav of CalKey, who presented a talk on the design and use of model-driven architecture and middle\u00ad ware in industry. We would like to thank all the people who helped organize and run the workshop. In particular, we would like to thank the program committee for their careful reviews of the submitted papers, Wolfgang Emmerich for being an excellent General Chair, and the participants for a lively and interesting workshop."

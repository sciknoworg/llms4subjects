            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The aim of this collection was to provide an opportunity for the sharing of information and to facilitate cooperation in mechatronics and new materials research, and to disseminate new research results in this multi-disciplinary field. The task was not only to acquaint contributors with the work of scientists from other countries, but also to widen their future collaboration. The papers are divided into six sections: I Actuators, Sensors, Test Benches; II Control of Mechatronic Systems; III Optimization, optimal design; IV Analysis of Vibrations: V Tribology; VI Robotics. The papers can also be sub-divided into those in which a purely theoretical approach to the problem is presented, and others which are aimed at combined, theoretical and practical, research. A thirds group includes those in which mainly practical solutions are addressed. Overall, this results in a thorough coverage of the subject and will be welcomed by both theoreticians and hands-on engineers",

                "We are honoured to present this collection of selected papers from the International Conference on Mixing and Crystallization, held at the Tioman Island, Malaysia in April, 1998. We are grateful to the editorial board comprising five eminent researchers in the field of mixing and crystallization for their thoughtful review and suggestions. In order to make this book as current as possible some of the papers have been thoroughly revised, which caused some delay in bringing out this edited version. We received necessary support from the Institute of Post Graduate Studies and Research, the University of Malaya and the Special Research Centre for Multiphase Processes, and the University of Newcastle, Australia in organizing this conference. We are indebted to the Institute of Chemical Engineers, United Kingdom, and the Institution of Engineers, Malaysia for their sponsorship. We would like to thank K.C. Lim, Dr. C. Ramakanth and Ms. Zubaidah for their help at the various stages of editing. We would also like to express our gratitude to Professor Mohd. Ali Hashim and Dr. Nafis Ahmed for their help and encouragement. Finally, I would like to thank Kluwer Academic Publishers for publishing this book.

                "This book constitutes the refereed post-conference proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Advancement of Science and Technology, ICAST 2018, which took place in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, in October 2018. The 47 revised full papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 71 submissions. The papers present economic and technologic developments in modern societies in five tracks: agro-processing industries for sustainable development, water resources development for the shared vision in blue Nile basin, IT and computer technology innovation, recent advances in electrical and computer engineering, progresses in product design and system optimization",

            "abstract": "Collection of selected, peer reviewed papers from the 16th Redevelopment and Rehabilitation of Buildings Conference (CRRB 2014), November 5-6, 2014, Brno, Czech Republic. The 59 papers are grouped as follows: Chapter 1: Protection and Remediation of Wood Structures; Chapter 2: Surface Treatment; Chapter 3: Restoration of Stone; Chapter 4: Redevelopment of Masonry; Chapter 5: Redevelopment of Concrete Structures; Chapter 6: Materials Properties and Measurements in Building; Chapter 7: Static and Dynamic Analysis of Buildings and Constructions Keyword: Rehabilitation, Remediation, Material Degradation, Building Materials, Monuments, Maintenance, Methods of Structural Diagnostics, Buildings This is an edited selection of more than 50 papers from the 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Buildings held in 2014 in Czech Republic. The papers fall into seven chapters. \"Chapter 1: Protection and Remediation of Wood Structures\" contains papers on glazes and protective coatings, as well as reports on castle reconstruction, wood mineralization, and a test of a facade of bonded joints. \"Chapter 2: Surface Treatment,\" has articles on compressive strength of cement and cement pastes; thermal insulation and capillary active plasters; surface efflorescence; and nanotextile application to historic plaster. \"Chapter 3: Restoration of Stone\" has two case studies. Papers in \"Chapter 4: Redevelopment of Masonry,\" look at historic castle galleries, drying technologies in masonry structures, hydrophobization, protection against technical seismicity; optimizing special mortars; and the use of carbon composites in rehabilitating historic vaults. \"Chapter 5: Redevelopment of Concrete Structures,\" contains nine papers, including a case study of reconstruction of a bath house in the Czech Republic, a study of sealants suitable for use with a concrete structure, and one on the influence of an aggressive environment upon special repair materials. \"Chapter 6: Materials Properties and Measurements in Building,\" has 24 papers. Topics in \"Chapter 7: Static and Dynamic Analysis of Buildings and Constructions,\" include, among others: comparison of two medieval trusses as to geometric and static analysis; flexural buckling of columns strengthened under load; insufficient maintenance as an Achilles heel of of a group of churches; and the shear strength of epoxy adhesive used for chemical anchors. \u2014 Architectural engineering\u2014 Civil engineering\u2014 Construction",

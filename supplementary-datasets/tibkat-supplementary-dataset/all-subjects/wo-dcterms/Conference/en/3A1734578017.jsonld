Written in a versatile and contemporary style, this book can be used as an invaluable reference source for graduate students, scientist, researcher working in chemistry, polymer chemistry, polymer engineering, chemical engineering and materials science. We are thankfully appreciate the tremendous efforts and co-operation of all contributing authors for their devotion, valuable time in preparing state-of-art chapters for this book. We would also like to express our gratitude to the publishers and all authors, and others for granting us the copyright permissions to use their illustrations. Although sincere efforts were made to obtain the copyright permissions from the respective owners to include the citation with the reproduced materials, we would like to offer our sincere apologies to any copyright holder if unknowingly their right is being infringed. Keyword: materials for biomedicine, nanomaterials, powder coating, advanced materials Chemists and materials scientists provide critical insight into scientific,engineering, and processing aspects of various materials that might ultimately contribute to the advance of medical sciences. The expected readership is wide,so no deep expertise is assumed in any of the areas discussed. The topics are pentose phosphate pathway in disease and therapy; advanced materials for genedelivery; weeds as alternative useful medicinal sources:  Linn. on diabetes mellitus and its complications; substitute quinolinederivatives as potent biological agents; congenital heart diseases and biotechnology connecting by connexin; biocompatible polymeric powder coatingsenriched with nano-titania: adhesion, thermal, and biological characterizations; and nanomaterials in electrochemical biosensors. \u2014 Biomaterials\u2014 Biomedical research\u2014 Materials science",

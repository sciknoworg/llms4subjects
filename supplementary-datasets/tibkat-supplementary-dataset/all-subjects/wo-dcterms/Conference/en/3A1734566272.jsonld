            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This collection of peer-reviewed papers contain new research results in the field of advanced mechanical engineering. The object was to bring together researchers, development engineers and users from around the world, and from both industry and academia, in order to share state-of-art ideas for exploring new areas of research and development, and to discuss emerging issues facing advanced mechanical engineering. Workers in the field will welcome this timely coverage of the subject.  Of the 600 papers submitted for this year's conference, 249 were accepted after review by specialists, and these are augmented by the invited keynote addresses. The topics include a robust method for separating noisy biomedical signals, effects of nanoscale patterns on the spectral absorptance of wafers, research on a trade model of transaction costs based on electronic commerce, a comparison among turbulence models for a novel static circulating jet mixer, the strategic study of the International Fire Fighting Robot Competition, applying fuzzy theory and gray-based rough set theory in supplier selection decision making, developing and applying the optimization design of a progressive die based on transfer unit, scheduling optimization for a flexible job shop, applying and implementing the Monte Carlo method in mechanical engineering, an explicit analysis method for walking-beam oil pumping units, producing zinc powder by alkaline hyrometallurgy, and the super-harmonic resonance analysis of torsional vibration in a misaligned rotor driven by a universal joint. The two volumes are paged and indexed together",

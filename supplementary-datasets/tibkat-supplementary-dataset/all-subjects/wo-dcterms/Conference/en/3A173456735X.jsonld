            "abstract": "This volume presents the proceedings of the International Symposium on Ecological Environment and Technology of Concrete, held on August 1st to 4th, 2011 in Beijing, China. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The main aim of this symposium was to highlight the relationship between concrete technology and the ecological environment; thus covering a wide range of topics such as the preparation of high-strength/high-performance concrete, durability, raw materials, workability, chemical admixtures, new applications, property characterization, environmental impact of concrete production and behavior of concrete structures. In all, 70 papers from China, Norway and the USA were presented at the conference. These proceedings offer a very up-to-date overview of the field.  Researchers from Norway, the US, and China share results of investigations into concrete as a structural material in construction, drawing heavily on the experience of infrastructure projects in China over the past few decades. Nine keynote addresses are among the 70 papers, which cover cementitious materials, chemical admixture, preparation and mechanical properties of concrete, and durability. Among specific topics are drying shrinkage in concrete prepared with iron mine tailings, the effect of carbonation curing for cement minerals and clinkers, experimental evidence for compatibility between underwater anti-washout admixture and superplasticizer, the damage evolution of reactive powder concrete by low-velocity impact, the permeability and corrosion of reinforced self-compacting concrete, and the technology and application prospects of tilt-up construction in China. The volume is also an issue of the international journal Key Engineering Materials",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The current volume of the Solid State Phenomena contains some new results in mechatronic systems, mechanics and materials, as well as in aspects of automatics and robotics in relevant technological applications. Therefore, the book is divided into three main chapters: mechatronics, automatics and robotics, and it contains the latest theoretical and practical experiences of scientists and researchers from universities and research centers. The main objective of this volume is the dissemination of the scientific knowledge to better understanding of widely considered mechatronic and material systems. Moreover, the aim of the issue is to interconnect diverse scientific fields and exchange current views between scientists and researchers. The Editors would like to express their appreciation to the Authors for their valuable contributions published in this volume, as well as to the Reviewers for excellent work, which helped us select the papers contained in the issue.We hope that the volume will be a source of knowledge and inspiration for scientists, researchers and practitioners working in the fields of interest covered by the book. Keyword: mechatronics, automatics and robotics Mechatronics, automatics, and robotics are the themes of the 41 papers, which range from basic science to details of practical engineering. Among the topics are analyzing power supply maintenance in transport telematics systems, creating terrain maps for unmanned ground platforms, experimental research on the directional stability of articulated tractors, a reliability model of motorway emergency communication systems, an automatically controlled anti-collision maneuver and its numerical simulation with disturbances, predicting the spatial orientation of a ship by means of neural networks, characterizing the matrix game sensitivity of the safe passing of ships at sea, analyzing parameters of the impact of a traveling wave on the speed of a biomimetic underwater vehicle, and evaluating he stiffness of fire rescue robot suspension with hydropneumatic components. \u2014 Mechanical engineering",

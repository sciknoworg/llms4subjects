            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The present volumes provide up-to-date and state-of-the art knowledge of the manufacturing science and engineering, including: Kinematic, Dynamic and Static Analysis, Vibration, Noise Analysis and Control, Mechanical Transmission. Theory and Applications, Reliability of Machines and Mechanisms, Sensor Technology, Electromechanics and Mechatronics, Industrial Robotics, Advanced NC Techniques and Equipment, Organization and Management of Modern Manufacturing, etc. The volumes will not only provide the readers a broad overview of the latest advances but also provide the researchers a valuable summary and reference in this field.  The four volume proceedings contain select peer reviewed papers from the 4th International Conference on Manufacturing Science and Engineering held in Dalian, China March 30-31, 2013. The conference, sponsored by Northeastern University, China, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Jilin University, brought together leading researchers, engineers, and scientists reporting on the latest developments in manufacturing process and equipment. The papers in Part One consider kinematic, dynamic and static analysis in machine building and construction. Those in Part Two concern sensor technology. Part Three is devoted to machine vision and Part Four looks at advanced methods and algorithms in research and engineering. A sample of paper topics includes measurement and research on stage machinery noise in theater, balance and vibration analysis on an in-line five cylinder engine, stability design of cutting current based on fuzzy control theory, skin color detection using the statistical decision theory, improved design on guardrail used for frequent accident occurring highway section, work principle and application of linear motion unit, teaching in technological institutes, risk decision-making system in manufacture enterprise management, preliminary discussion on training mode of excellence engineer in application oriented university, and study on multimedia education system of technological college",

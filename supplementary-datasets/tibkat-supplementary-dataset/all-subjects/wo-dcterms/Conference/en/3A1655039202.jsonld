                "This volume contains review articles and original results obtained in various fields of modern science using mathematical simulation methods. The basis of the articles are the plenary and some section reports that were made and discussed at the Fourth International Mathematical Simulation Conference, held in Moscow on June 27 through July 1, 2000. The conference was devoted to the following scientific areas: \u2022 mathematical and computer discrete systems models; \u2022 non-linear excitation in condensed media; \u2022 complex systems evolution; \u2022 mathematical models in economics; \u2022 non-equilibrium processes kinematics; \u2022 dynamics and structure of the molecular and biomolecular systems; \u2022 mathematical transfer models in non-linear systems; \u2022 numerical simulation and algorithms; \u2022 turbulence and determined chaos; \u2022 chemical physics of polymer. This conference was supported by the Russian Ministry of Education, Russian foundation for Basic Research and Federal Program \"Integration\". This volume contains the following sections: 1. models of non-linear phenomena in physics; 2. numerical methods and computer simulations; 3. mathematical computer models of discrete systems; 4. mathematical models in economics; 5. non-linear models in chemical physics and physical chemistry; 6. mathematical models of transport processes in complex systems. In Sections One and Five a number of fundamental and sufficiently general problems, concerning real physical and physical-chemical systems simulation, is discussed.",

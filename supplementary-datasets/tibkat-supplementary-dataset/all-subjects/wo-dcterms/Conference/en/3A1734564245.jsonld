            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This collection comprises 144 papers which were carefully selected from the over 300 papers submitted for the purposes of this special volume. All of the papers were subjected to peer-review by at least two expert referees. The papers were selected on the basis of their quality and their relevance to the topic. The resultant volume presents readers with the most recent advances in the field of machining and advanced manufacturing technology. It will therefore be invaluable to production and research engineers, research students and academics working in the field. These 144 papers were drawn from those presented at the August 2007 conference, and include leading-edge research in theory and applications. Written by practitioners as well as academics from China's technical institutes and colleges and universities, the papers' subjects include coatings, thermomechanical techniques, and new materials. Topics of specific papers include the characterization of new forms of glass, behaviors of suspended powders, low-temperature coal-fired ceramics for microsystem applications, the effects of abrasive water jet machining on brittle materials, advanced dye materials and their properties, micro-foaming processes and microstructures, ultrafine milling and grinding, theoretical and experimental study on lasers, research on surface finishing, cemented carbide substrates in miniature systems, predictions of chatter stability at multiple frequencies in high-speed milling systems, and the development of higher machining efficiency using an optical remote sensor. Includes author and key word indices",

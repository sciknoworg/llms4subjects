            "abstract": "This publication collects the Proceedings of the 33rd Biennial Session of the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) held in Interlaken, Switzerland on 26-31 May 2002. Around 400 participants from 60 countries took part in the ICAR Session or attended the Interbull Meeting. The activities were divided into five parallel technical sessions. Overall, about 40 technical papers and reports were presented during the sessions. A technical session was especially reserved for the presentation of the activities of the Task-Forces, Sub-Committees and Working Groups in which a total of 19 reports were presented. The issues that were discussed covered the use of new technologies for animal performance recording, the application of national animal tracing databases, the use of data from permanent milk recording for official performance recording, the performance recording of beef traits and possible alternative systems of recording of functional traits. Particularly relevant was also the involvement of representatives of non-member organizations, especially from Central and Eastern Europe and developing countries, whose needs demonstrate the possibilities that are offered to ICAR to help the (re)organization of the animal sector. This supporting activity with those finalized to reach a better comparison of the production systems among the member organization demonstrate the potentialities of the association. The Sessions allowed an active exchange of ideas and experiences among the participants who recognized that the dialogue is the engine for improvement. Considering that the resources of most member organizations have been reduced, the need of working together was strongly underlined, today more than in the past, in order to achieve shared objectives",

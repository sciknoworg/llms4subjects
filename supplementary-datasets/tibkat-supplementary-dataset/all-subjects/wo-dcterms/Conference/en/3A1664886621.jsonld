                "This book constitutes the full papers and short monographs developed on the base of the refereed proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technologies: Information and Communication Technologies for Research and Industry (ICIT-2019), held in Saratov, Russia in February 2019. The book brings accepted papers which present new approaches and methods of solving problems in the sphere of control engineering and decision making for the various fields of studies: industry and research, ontology-based data simulation, smart city technologies, theory and use of digital signal processing, cognitive systems, robotics, cybernetics, automation control theory, image recognition technologies, and computer vision. Particular emphasis is laid on modern trends, new approaches, algorithms and methods in selected fields of interest. The presented papers were accepted after careful reviews made by at least three independent reviewers in a double-blind way. The acceptance level was about 60%. The chapters are organized thematically in several areas within the following tracks: \u2022 Models, Methods & Approaches in Decision Making Systems \u2022 Mathematical Modelling for Industry & Research \u2022 Smart City Technologies The conference is focused on development and globalization of information and communication technologies (ICT), methods of control engineering and decision making along with innovations and networking, ICT for sustainable development and technological change, and global challenges. Moreover, the ICIT-2019 served as a discussion area for the actual above-mentioned topics. The editors believe that the readers will find the proceedings interesting and useful for their own research work"

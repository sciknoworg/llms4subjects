            "abstract": "This book offers a timely snapshot of innovative research and developments at the interface between design, manufacturing, materials, mechanical and process engineering, and quality assurance. It covers various manufacturing processes, such as grinding, milling, broaching, and gear machining, including additive manufacturing, vibrational-centrifugal strengthening, laser-ultrasonic surface hardening, and antifriction coatings. It focuses on computer and numerical simulation, mathematical and integrated process modeling, parametric synthesis, virtual prototyping, automatic control, design of manufacturing, mechanical and mechatronics systems. It describes innovative cutting and abrasive processes and combined technologies. It also covers the formation, strengthening, and thermomechanical rolling. It also investigates the temperature field behavior, thermal stability, wear resistance, and other processes of various materials. Gathering the best papers presented at the 5th Grabchenko\u2019s International Conference on Advanced Manufacturing Processes (InterPartner-2023), held on September 5\u20138, 2023, in Odessa, Ukraine, this book provides a comprehensive and up-to-date examination of design, manufacturing, mechanical, materials, and process engineering, as well as quality assurance trends and technologies. Yet, it also aims at fostering international and interdisciplinary communication and collaborations, offering a bridge between the academic and industrial sector.",

            "abstract": "The object of this collection of peer-reviewed papers is to provide a forum for the discussion of new developments, recent progress and innovations in the design and implementation of MEMS, NANO and Smart Systems-on-Chip. It addresses all aspects of the design methodology of such systems, with the emphasis on current and future challenges in research and development in both academia and industry. The 983 papers are grouped into 22 chapters: Materials Behavior, Casting and Solidification, Surface, Subsurface and Interface Phenomena, Coatings and Surface Engineering, Composite Materials, Materials Forming, Machining, Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing, Biomedical Manufacturing, Environmentally Sustainable Manufacturing Processes and Systems, Manufacturing Process Planning and Scheduling, Meso/Micro-Manufacturing Equipment and Processes, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Manufacturing Processes, Computer-Aided Design, Manufacturing and Engineering, Semiconductor Materials Manufacturing, Laser-Based Manufacturing, Precision Molding Processes, Rapid Manufacturing Technologies, Nontraditional Manufacturing, Nanofabrication, Nanometrology and Applications, Metrology and Measurement, and Mechanical and Electronic Engineering Control. The huge volume of information makes this a veritable encyclopedia of the subject matter.Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).  This six-volume set contains papers from the Seventh International Conference on MEMS (Micro-Electronic Mechanical Systems), NANO, and Smart Systems (ICMENS 2011), held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in November 2011. Topics include materials behavior; casting and solidification; surface, subsurface, and interface phenomena; coatings and surface engineering; composite materials; materials forming; machining; nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing; environmentally sustainable manufacturing processes and systems; biomedical manufacturing; process planning and scheduling; meso/micro manufacturing equipment and processes; modeling, analysis, and simulation of processes; computer-aided design, manufacturing, and engineering; semiconductor materials manufacturing; laser-based manufacturing; precision molding processes; rapid manufacturing technologies; nontraditional manufacturing; nanofabrication, nanometrology, and applications; metrology and measurement; and mechanical and electronic engineering control. Contributors are engineers, scientists, and researchers from around the world",

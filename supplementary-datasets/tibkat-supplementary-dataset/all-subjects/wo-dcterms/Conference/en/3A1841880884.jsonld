                "This book is on various advanced, simple, and novel techniques being used and developed in the area of manufacturing processes. Manufacturing sector is one of the important areas which help to improve the economy of our nation. It not only generates employment opportunities but also makes us self-reliant (aatma nirbhar). In line with this important agenda of Government of India, this track envisages high-quality research contributions in the field of low-cost manufacturing technologies. It comprises the research and development studies on the various factors that influence the cost of manufacturing of product or system. The factors are materials, manufacturing processes, material handling processes, skilled manpower, quality control technologies, effective communication, and use of artificial intelligence techniques. The papers are on both numerical and experimental research works related to these aspects. ."

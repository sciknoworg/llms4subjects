Education is the cornerstone of any society; it serves as one of the foundations for many of its social values and characteristics. mis4TEL\u201923 promotes the interaction among the scientific community to discuss applications of Technology Enhanced Learning solutions targeting not only cognitive and social processes but also motivational, personality, or emotional factors. In addition, current trends concerning the use of artificial intelligence can help and augment learning opportunities for learners and educators. We would like to thank all the contributing authors, the members of the program committee, national associations (AEPIA, and APPIA), and the sponsors (AIR Institute, and Camara Municipal de Guimar\u00e3es).",

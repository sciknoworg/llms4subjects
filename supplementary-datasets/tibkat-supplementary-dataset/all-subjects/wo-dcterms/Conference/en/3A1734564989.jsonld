            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This volume brings together the most exciting ideas of international, and especially European, researchers concerning the latest developments in severe plastic deformation techniques and in the thermomechanical processing of materials for both structural and functional applications. The areas of interest include not only the conventional hot- and cold-deformation of metals but also recently developed severe plastic deformation processes for the production of ultra-fine and nanostructured materials.In particular, the following specific topics are covered: Multifunctional nanostructured coatings, Modelling and recrystallization, Nanostructured materials and Severe plastic deformation, Hot plastic deformation, Process Mechanics and Microstructure. It is to be noted that this volume honors Prof. Enrico Evangelista on the occasion of his 70th birthday. The professor has been working in the field of materials science for more than 30 years and been a faculty member of the Marche Polytechnic University of Ancona since 1982. He is a fellow of ASM International and has been very active in a range of research activities; publishing over 300 papers in collaboration with other highly-regarded scientists throughout the world.The quality of the present papers reflects the exacting standards of the professor. European and other researchers share findings and thoughts regarding severe plastic deformation techniques and the thermo-mechanical processing of materials for both structural and functional applications. The conventional hot and cold deformation of metals is explored of course, but also recently developed processes for producing ultra-fine and nanostructured materials. Of the 60 papers presented, 40 are represented here, exploring such topics as the nanoindentation of silicon, developing superplasticity in metallic alloys by applying severe plastic deformation, plastic flow and grain refinement under simple shear-based severe plastic deformation processing, engendering ultra-fine microstructures in titanium with powder metallurgy for improved ductility and strength, the influence of dynamic restoration in failure at elevated temperatures, and the role of boundaries in the control of deformation rate and strength of crystalline materials",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This volume contains innovations, recent research findings, new advancements and practical solutions that will lead to future advancement of road and airfield pavement technology. It is divided into seven (7) chapters: Pavement Design, Evaluation and Performance; Pavement Materials; Sustainability in Pavement Engineering; Pavement Maintenance, Rehabilitation, and Preservation; Pavement Management Systems; Construction and Transportation Engineering; and Airfield Pavement. The volume will serves as valuable resources and references for all researchers and practitioners from academia, government officials, and industries for their future research studies.  Even a well established technical field, such as the manufacture, maintenance, and repair of road and airfield pavement is constantly changing. This timely volume contains the papers delivered at a conference held in July 2013 and features a special section on sustainability in pavement engineering, with papers exploring topics ranging from the harvest of green energy from roads to the energy-saving manufacture of foam asphalt. The preface itself appears to have been written before the conference was held in July 2013",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).It is noticeable that superalloys have regained their momentum. The worldwide effort to increase the efficiency and extend the lifetime of energy conversion facilities depends upon improved materials and manufacturing techniques. Materials are now expected to exhibit outstanding mechanical strength and creep resistance at high temperatures, as well as a good corrosion and oxidation resistance. Superalloys have this potential, but many of the commercial grades are still based upon metallurgical concepts that date back to the 1980s, and have typically been exploited so far in only a few prominent areas of application. Improvement in their high-temperature capability, and the adaption of manufacturing processes to new fields of application, present major challenges to current researchers in industry and academia. These papers, published within the context of the first European Symposium on Superalloys, present the current state of progress in the development, production and properties of cast, wrought and powder-metallurgical superalloys and associated coating systems. They represent a timely and invaluable guide to the subject.  About 100 papers share recent developments and current trends in creating and using metal alloys with characteristics specific to a particular application. The plenary paper looks at mechanical properties of the ternary L12 compound Co3(Al,W) in single and polycrystalline forms. Others cover microstructure and characterization; modeling and simulation; processing; mechanical behavior; alloy development; solidification; manufacturing, joining, and repair; high-temperature coating; materials beyond superalloys; and the performance of materials in service environments. echanism of technological innovations in industrial symbiosis, agricultural function positions in New Period China, and the present situation of water pollution in Shenyang City and control measures",

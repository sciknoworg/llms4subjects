            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This collection comprises 130 selected peer-reviewed papers which address a number of scientific issues underlying the increased global attention paid to mechanical product performance and reliability.Contributions were received from researchers in 8 different countries. The collection aims to report the latest experimental findings and to promote further theoretical research into mechanical product development and reliability. The topics covered include materials-related product development and reliability technologies, variability in materials properties, scale-induced changes in properties, failure analysis, design analysis, manufacturing and machining technologies, numerical modelling and product innovation.This makes the work a handy guide to the current trends in the field. These proceedings of the August 2008 conference include over 120 papers on the improvement of mechanical product development methods and reliability, focusing on such general topics materials-related product and reliability technologies, variability in materials properties, scale-induced changes in properties, failure analysis, design analysis, manufacturing and machining technologies, numeric modeling, and product innovation development. Papers address the reliability of experts and expert systems, measurement of scale-induced fatigue behavior for railway axles, deformation of the injection mold core, modeling of fatigue crack growth based on two cyclic plasticity models, mechanical fatigue life estimations for pistons, workflow modeling methods for collaborative product development, functional evolution process modeling and management for conceptual product design, damage analysis of glass-to-metal diffusion welded joints, delivery of a quality product in a value chain, and a method of fuzzy probability using a small sample. Although represented as comprising multiple volumes by the publisher, these proceedings are published in a single volume",

            "abstract": "This special volume is part 2 of a mini-series on, \"Materials Manufacturing Science and Technology XII\". It covers three topics: Modern design theory & methodology, MEMS & nanotechnology, Materials science & technology in manufacturing. Presented here is a collection of 125 papers selected from over 510 papers originally submitted by universities and industrial concerns all over the world. All of the papers have been peer-reviewed. The papers selected for this volume were chosen on the basis of their quality and their relevance to the topic. This work reflects the latest developments in this field; running the gamut from fundamentals to new techniques and applications. This book thus provides a valuable reference work for researchers in the materials manufacturing science and technology fields who wish to understand further the underlying mechanisms and to create new and practical technologies, systems and processes.It covers topics such as: Advanced manufacturing technology and equipment, Modern design theory and methodology, MEMS and nanotechnology, Materials science and technology in manufacturing, Manufacturing systems and automation. It should also be particularly useful to practicing engineers in precision manufacturing who are responsible for ensuring efficient and effective operations. The two volumes of this proceedings contain nearly 300 papers that were first presented at the 13th International Manufacturing Conference in China, held in Dalian, China in September 2009. The papers are grouped into sections, with Vol.1 containing those on advanced manufacturing technology and equipment and manufacturing systems and automation, and Vol. 2 those on modern design theory and methodology, MEMS and nanotechnology, and material science and technology in manufacturing. Each paper presents new research and methods used in very closely defined materials science projects, contributed by an international group of engineers who are based mainly in China. The papers include an abstract, list of key words, and list of references and are heavily illustrated with supporting drawings, photos, tables, and other images as well as the mathematical formulas employed. A sampling of topics includes experimentation of diamond wire saw cutting compound pipes underwater, static rigidity analysis of the position adjustable computer table using ANSYS, and control parameters and quantification for system reliability design.

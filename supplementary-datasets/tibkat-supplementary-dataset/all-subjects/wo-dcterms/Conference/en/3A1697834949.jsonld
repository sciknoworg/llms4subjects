                "The book focuses on a global issue\u2014municipal solid waste management (MSWM) and presents the most effective solutions based on energy recovery processes. There is huge potential in employing different technologies and modern management methodology for recovering energy from various waste streams to establish a sustainable and circular economy. In several countries, energy recovery from municipal solid wastes (MSW) is seen as a way of reducing the negative impact of waste on the environment and also reducing the burden on land resources. The book primarily focuses on highlighting the latest insights into energy recovery from various waste streams in different countries, with a particular emphasis on India. Further, it paves the way for sustainability in the energy sector as a whole by addressing waste management issues and simultaneous energy recovery. The chapters present high-quality research papers selected and presented in the conference, IconSWM 2018"

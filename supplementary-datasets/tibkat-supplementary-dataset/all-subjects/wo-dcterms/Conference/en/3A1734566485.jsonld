            "abstract": "This book brings together the latest advances in, and applications of, manufacturing science and engineering. It comprises 976 papers, selected from among 3062 papers which were submitted by universities and industrial laboratories all over the world. All of chosen papers were subjected to strict peer-review. The major areas covered are: Materials behavior; Casting and solidification; Powder metallurgy and ceramic forming; Surface, subsurface, and interface phenomena; Coatings and surface engineering; Composite materials; Materials forming; Machining; Nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing; Biomedical manufacturing; Environmentally sustainable manufacturing processes and systems; Manufacturing process planning and scheduling; Meso/micro manufacturing equipment and processes; Modeling, analysis, and simulation of manufacturing processes; Computer-aided design, manufacturing and engineering; Semiconductor materials manufacturing; Laser based manufacturing; Precision molding processes; Joining processes; Rapid manufacturing technologies; Non-traditional manufacturing; Nanofabrication, nanometrology and applications; Metrology and measurement.This book will provide readers with a broad overview of the latest advances in the field of manufacturing science and engineering, and will become an invaluable reference work for researchers in the fields of manufacturing science and engineering. Sponsored and organized by the U. of Wollongong, Australia, the Hong Kong Industrial Technology Research Centre, and Guangzhou U. of China, the December 2009 conference (ICMSE 2009) accepted 978 papers for presentation (from more than 3,000 submissions). These papers are presented in five volumes, with a keyword index in the fifth. Organization is in 24 chapters, each with multiple contributions. Among the primary themes: semiconductor materials manufacturing, precision molding processes, materials forming and behavior, casting and solidification, powder metallurgy and ceramic forming, surface and subsurface interface phenomena coatings, composites, machining, nanomaterials, and computer-aided design, manufacturing, and engineering. A sampling of specific topics: research on stamping spring-back prediction for car body panel based on BP neural network, low cycle fatigue life of SC notched specimens, three-dimensional fatigue crack propagation, and sustainable manufacturing technology and properties of steel stag concrete",

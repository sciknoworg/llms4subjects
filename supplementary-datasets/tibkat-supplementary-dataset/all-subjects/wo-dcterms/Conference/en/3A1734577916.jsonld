            "abstract": "This book summarizes selected papers of student conference focused on the study of properties of building materials. Presented papers deal with investigation of materials properties of conventional and also innovative building materials. The knowledge of particular material properties is essentially for successful design of structures, that is the reason why studies of basic physical, chemical, mechanical, thermal, hygric, technological and transport properties were included into this book. Experimental programs of present contributions were performed according standard system of EN and ISO but for the design of building structures is important to predict behaviour of used materials on the end of their supposed lifetime which could be number of decades. That is the reason why nowadays is necessary to apply advanced numerical and computation methods to determine of long-term durability. Last mentioned sophisticated instrument based on the theoretical principals is important to be verified in real conditions; science would be extremely boring and sterile without an experiment. Presented papers bring wide database of testing methods and materials properties which could be used in all branches of civil engineering. Keyword: properties of building materials This volume collects 31 papers from the 1st International Doctoral Conference on Advanced Materials, which was held in July 2014 in Zahr\u00e1dky, Czech Republic. The student conference focused on research on the properties of building materials, and papers discuss conventional and innovative materials and their physical, chemical, mechanical, thermal, hygric, technological, and transport properties. Contributors are doctoral students in engineering and other fields, mainly at the Czech Technical U. in Prague. \u2014 Civil engineering\u2014 Construction\u2014 Materials science",

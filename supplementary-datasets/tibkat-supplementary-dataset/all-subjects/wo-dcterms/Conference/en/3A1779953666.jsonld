                "This book includes recent research on disruptive technologies, tech ethics, and artificial intelligence. Due to the important advances in technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things or bioinformatics produced in recent years, it is necessary to conduct a thorough review of current ethical patterns. One of the research fields that is in full expansion and with a broad future is technology ethics or tech ethics. Just a few years ago, this type of research was a small part, and they did not have too many technology researchers involved. At present, due to the explosion of new applications of artificial intelligence, their problems and their legal barriers have flourished innumerable initiatives, declarations, principles, guides and analyses focused on measuring the social impact of these systems and on the development of a more ethical technology. It is, therefore, a problem that needs to be addressed from an academic and multidisciplinary point of view, where experts in ethics and behavior work together with experts in new and disruptive technologies. The international conference \u201cDisruptive Technologies Tech Ethics and Artificial Intelligence\u201d (DITTET 2021) provides a forum to present and discuss the latest scientific and technical advances and their implications in the field of ethics. It also provides a forum for experts to present their latest research in disruptive technologies, promoting knowledge transfer. It provides a unique opportunity to bring together experts in different fields, academics and professionals to exchange their experience in the development and deployment of disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence and their ethical problems. DiTTEt intends to bring together researchers and developers from industry, humanities and academia to report on the latest scientific advances and the application of artificial intelligence as well as its ethical implications in fields as diverse as climate change, politics, economy or security in today\u2019s world. This book constitutes the refereed proceedings selected by an expert panel through a peer-review process. All these works will be presented by the experts in the different sessions organized at the DITTET congress to be held at the Pontifical University of Salamanca (Salamanca, Spain) on September 15, 26 and 17, 2021.",

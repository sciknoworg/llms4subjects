            "abstract": "This Festschrift, dedicated to Manuel Hermenegildo on the occasion of his 60th birthday, contains papers written by many of his closest collaborators. Manuel received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, and among various positions he was an endowed chair in Information Science and Technology at the University of New Mexico. In 2007 he became the founding director of the IMDEA Software Institute, where he is now a Distinguished Professor, while also a full professor at Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (UPM). He has published more than 300 scientific publications, given numerous keynotes and invited talks at major conferences, coordinated many national and international projects, and served the community in major conference roles, on journal boards, and on funding, scientific, and research committees. Among his awards are the Julio Rey Pastor prize in Mathematics and Information Science and Technology and the Aritmel prize in Computer Science; he is an elected member of the Academia Europaea; and in 2022 he was elected a Fellow of the ACM for contributions to program analysis, verification, parallelism, logic programming, and the IMDEA Software Institute. Throughout his career Manuel has shown his amazing capacity for detailed work, thoroughness, and expert contributions, along with the interpersonal skills needed for successful collaboration, such as a positive attitude and a sense of humor. The contributions in this volume reflect the quality and the scope of his research interests and mentoring successes",

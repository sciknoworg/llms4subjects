            "abstract": "The collection includes selected, peer-reviewed papers from the 2nd International Conference on Civil Engineering and Transportation (ICCET 2012) held October 27-28, 2012 in Guilin, China.The 432 papers are grouped into the following chapters: Chapter 1: Architectural Design and its Theory,Chapter 2: Urban Planning and Design, Chapter 3: Sustainable City and Regional Development, Chapter 4: Building Materials and Processing Technology, Chapter 5: Renewable Energy and Building Energy Saving, Chapter 6: Building Ecological Environment,Chapter 7: Environmental Engineering and Environmental Protection, Chapter 8: Transportation Planning, Construction and Operation Organization, Chapter 9: ITS Theory and Applications, Chapter 10: Modern Logistics System Planning and Optimization, Chapter 11: Traffic Control and Information Technology, Chapter 12: Urban Transportation Planning and Management, Chapter 13: Vehicle Engineering.  The 430 papers presented during the October 2012 conference share thoughts on the practice and trends of construction technology and transportation in China. The first volume of the three-volume set explores architectural design theory, urban planning, city and regional development, building materials, and renewable energy. Three papers from Anna University study the behavior of confined polyolefin fiber reinforced concrete under monotonic compression and repeated axial compression. Volume two collects research on energy efficiency, environmental engineering, environmental protection, mass transportation planning and construction, and ITS theory. The final volume addresses logistics optimization, traffic control, urban transportation management, and vehicle engineering. Three papers from Beijing Jiaotong University analyze logistics reorganization of supermarket chains based on agriculture super docking, the factors driving port logistics development, and the layout of chemical logistics parks",

            "title": "Superplasticity in Advanced Materials - ICSAM 2006 : 9th International Conference on Superplasticity in Advanced Materials, 23-26 June 2006, Chengdu, P.R. China",
            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Interest in the phenomenon of superplasticity has been increasing steadily over the past thirty-four years, both from the viewpoint of fundamental scientific understanding as well as of industrial application. The scope of superplasticity has also broadened materials-wise, and now includes, in addition to metals: intermetallics, ceramics, bulk metallic glasses, nanostructured materials and composites. The objective of this special collection was to provide an international forum through which to gather up-to-date knowledge and information on a wide range of topics and to encourage further developments in superplasticity. Over 104 peer-reviewed papers have been selected for publication. The volume is divided into the following chapters: Plenary Session, Advanced Industrial Applications, Processing Methods, Material Processing for Superplasticity, Superplasticity in Light Metals, Product Design and Numerical Simulation, Mechanisms of Grain Boundary Sliding and Failure, Superplasticity in Metals, Superplasticity in Intermetallics, Superplasticity in Ceramics, Superplasticity in Bulk Metallic Glasses, High Strain Rate and Low Temperature Superplasticity, Microstructural Control and Microstructural Evolution during Superplastic Deformation.Altogether, the contents constitute a timely and invaluable guide to the state-of-the-art of superplasticity. A June 2006 conference brought together academic researchers and industrial practitioners to share the latest developments and applications in superplasticity and superplastic forming technology. Papers from the conference, 104 in all, are presented in 13 sections, covering industrial applications, processing methods, material processing for superplasticity, product design and numerical simulation, mechanisms of grain boundary sliding and failure, high strain rate and low temperature superplasticity, microstructural control and evolution during superplastic deformation, and superplasticity in metals, light metals, intermetallics, ceramics, nanostructured materials, and bulk metallic classes. Some specific paper topics include mechanisms for microsuperplasticity, superplasticity in ultrahigh carbon steel, superplastic behaviors of casting AZ31 magnesium alloy, finite element modeling of superplastic forming in the presence of back pressure, and superplastic deforming analysis based on element free Galerkin methods",

The papers in the proceedings were presented at the Sixth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Medical Engineering, and Education (AIMEE2022), which took place in Wuhan, China, from August 19 to 21, 2022.The book underlines the need for the intensification of training of an increasing number of appropriate specialists given the rapid growth of AI systems. In order to replicate human and other species' natural intelligence in digital AI systems, the researchers have been studying genetics and inherited biological processes in-depth. These studies offer fresh ideas for developing ever more powerful AI techniques. The featured articles cover a variety of themes in the fields of mathematics and biomathematics, medical approaches, technical and educational approaches, and medical approaches. The book is a compilation of recent academic papers in the discipline, covering a wide range of topics that are important to both business managers and engineers. This proceedings is a fantastic resource for asset management practitioners, researchers, and academics, as well as undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in AI, bioinformatics systems, and their developing applications. This is due to the breadth and depth of the proceedings. Experts, students, and other people who are interested in learning about how AI systems might be used in the future are the target audience",

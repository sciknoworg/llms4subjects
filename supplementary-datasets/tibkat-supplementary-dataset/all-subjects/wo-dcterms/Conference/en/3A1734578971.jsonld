Two hundred papers organized into ten chapters are presented, beginning with an extensive first chapter containing 72 contributions dealing with the science, production, and processing of engineered materials. Alternative energies and fuels as well as aeronautics technology are covered in the next two chapters, followed by papers on acoustics, vibrations, fatigue, fractures, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. Mechanistic design and automation are discussed, with the last two sections presenting a handful of papers on biomechanics and biomedical devices and a long list of contributions on production management via both technological assists and behavioral strategies. \u2014 Energy conversion and storage\u2014 Energy engineering\u2014 Engineering\u2014 Materials science\u2014 Mechanical engineering\u2014 Project management",

            "abstract": "This latest volume in the Bioceramics series is a collection of selected papers submitted to the 19th International Symposium on Ceramics in Medicine, held in Chengdu, China, from the 10 to 13th October, 2006. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).Among the many topics covered by the papers are: bio-active and bio-inert ceramics, composites, coatings, bioactive cements, porous materials, dental materials, orthopaedic implants, antibacterial materials, protein absorption, cell-material interactions in vitro, tissue response and clinical applications. In particular, tissue engineering, drug delivery, nanotechnology and surface modification were covered by an appreciable number of papers; thus reflecting the rapid progress made in these cutting-edge research topics and the latest directions taken by developments in biomaterials and their clinical applications . The book will be invaluable to materials scientists, bioengineers, molecular and cellular biologists, and clinicians.The contents comprise sections on: Apatites and Calcium Phosphates, Glass and Glass-Ceramics, Nanomaterials, Ceramic Composites, Bioactive Coatings and Biomimetic Apatites, Bioactive Cements, Protein Absorption & Cell Interactions, Porous Materials, Delivery Carriers for Drugs, Osteo-inductive Materials, Tissue Engineering, Wear, Other Materials, Orthopaedic Applications, Dental Materials & Applications. An international group of contributors present recent research in bioceramics at the 19th Annual Symposium on Ceramics in Medicine, which took place in Chengdu, China (where the editors are based, at the Sichuan U. and the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics) in October 2006. The 349 papers are organized into 15 topics, though they are characterized by the interdisciplinarity of the subject. Among the topics are tissue engineering, osteoinductive materials, dental materials, wear, bioactive coatings and biomimetic apatites, ceramic composites, and nanomaterials. The articles are illustrated with b&w microphotography, tables, and related material",

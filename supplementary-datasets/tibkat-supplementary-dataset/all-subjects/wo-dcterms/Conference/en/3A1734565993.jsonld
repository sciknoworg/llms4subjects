            "abstract": "This collection of peer-reviewed papers covers a wealth of innovations and practical experience regarding engineering and technology; materials science and technology in manufacturing including artificial materials, forming, novel material fabrication, green manufacturing, design and manufacturing of composite components, surface science and engineering, quality control of manufacturing systems, theoretical, simulation and experimental studies related to microstructure and residual stress; manufacturing systems and technologies including manufacturing process simulation, CIMS and manufacturing systems, vibration measurement and reliability analysis, finite-element analysis and structural optimization, fault diagnosis and maintenance theory, intelligent mechatronics and robotics, elements, structures, mechanisms, applications of micro- and nano-systems, compound machine tools, rapid prototyping, printing (ex. embossing), complex mechanico-electro-liquid system, PDM, ERP, CRM, FMS, PLM, logistics and supply chain, effects of machining method or technique on mechanical properties of materials, RPM, and Management. This copious work will be invaluable to production and research engineers, and also to research students and academics interested in the field. The Cross-Strait Engineering and Technologies and Ceeusro Association is an organization of academics that holds a conference in mainland China and Taiwan every two years. Some 90 selected and peer-reviewed papers from the 2009 incarnation look at such topics as a parametric modeling method for thin-walled frame parts, outer space target recognition based on image sequences, machining mechanisms of an abrasive water jet on ceramics, the disassembly design of used cars, the diversified development of scholarship in local colleges and universities, the design of a micromanipulator based on a piezo actuator, an intelligent recognition algorithm based on a mechanical seal fault feature, and an ontology-based design knowledge model",

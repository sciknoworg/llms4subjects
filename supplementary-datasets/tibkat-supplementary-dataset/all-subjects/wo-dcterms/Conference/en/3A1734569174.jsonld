            "abstract": "The Symposium and Annual Meeting of the International Society for Ceramics in Medicine, known as Bioceramics, provides a valuable forum where scientists and clinicians working in the dental and medical fields can discuss the exciting advances made in basic and applied research, and promote new technologies and applications of ceramics in medicine. These proceedings comprise 174 papers presented at the 23rd Symposium and Annual Meeting of the International Society for Ceramics in Medicine (ISCM) held on November 6-9th, 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey. In Bioceramics 23, the papers have been categorized into 21 of the most topical and essential themes of ceramics in medicine: including characterization, design and processing technologies, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, surface modification, composites, drug delivery and interdisciplinary studies. The work will thus be of great help in taking advantage of the merits of ceramics, and overcoming their weakness in various applications involving polymers and metals.  A November 2011 symposium provided a forum for scientists and clinicians in dental and medical fields to discuss new technologies and applications of ceramics in medicine and dentistry. Papers from the symposium are collected here in 21 sections on topics including alumina/zirconia ceramics, apatites, bioglasses and glass-ceramics, biomimetics, bone substitutes, calcium phosphate ceramics, cell materials interactions, and dements. Other main themes are clinical applications, coatings and composites, dental materials, drug delivery carriers, injectable materials, nanomaterials, osteoconductivity, porous materials, scaffolds, tissue engineering, titanium and alloys, and other materials. Some specific topics include pore morphology in MAO-produced oxide film, fabrication of bioactive apatite nuclei-precipitated composites, grafting materials for major sinus lift, and regulating protein absorption onto hydroxyapatite. Other subjects are nanobioceramics production from razor shell, improvement of bone growth on a PEEK surface implant, and adhesion behaviors of serum proteins on an oxide layer of commercially pure titanium. The book's audience includes those in materials science, bioengineering, and biology",

                "This book collects many of the presented papers, as plenary presentations, mini-symposia invited presentations, or contributed talks, from the European Conference on Numerical Mathematics and Advanced Applications (ENUMATH) 2017. The conference was organized by the University of Bergen, Norway from September 25 to 29, 2017. Leading experts in the field presented the latest results and ideas in the designing, implementation, and analysis of numerical algorithms as well as their applications to relevant, societal problems. ENUMATH is a series of conferences held every two years to provide a forum for discussing basic aspects and new trends in numerical mathematics and scientific and industrial applications. These discussions are upheld at the highest level of international expertise. The first ENUMATH conference was held in Paris in 1995 with successive conferences being held at various locations across Europe, including Heidelberg (1997), Jyvaskyla (1999), lschia Porto (2001), Prague (2003), Santiago de Compostela (2005), Graz (2007), Uppsala (2009), Leicester (2011), Lausanne (2013), and Ankara (2015)"

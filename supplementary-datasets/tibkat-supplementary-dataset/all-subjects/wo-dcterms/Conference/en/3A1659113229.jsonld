                "This volume contains extended abstracts outlining selected talks and other selected presentations given by participants throughout the \"Intensive Research Program on Advances in Nonsmooth Dynamics 2016\", held at the Centre de Recerca Matem\u00e0tica (CRM) in Barcelona from February 1st to April 29th, 2016. They include brief research articles reporting new results, descriptions of preliminary work or open problems, and outlines of prominent discussion sessions. The articles are all the result of direct collaborations initiated during the research program. The topic is the theory and applications of Nonsmooth Dynamics. This includes systems involving elements of: impacting, switching, on/off control, hybrid discrete-continuous dynamics, jumps in physical properties, and many others. Applications include: electronics, climate modeling, life sciences, mechanics, ecology, and more. Numerous new results are reported concerning the dimensionality and robustness of nonsmooth models, shadowing variables, numbers of limit cycles, discontinuity-induced bifurcations and chaos, determinacy-breaking, stability criteria, and the classification of attractors and other singularities. This material offers a variety of new exciting problems to mathematicians, but also a diverse range of new tools and insights for scientists and engineers making use of mathematical modeling and analysis. The book is intended for established researchers, as well as for PhD and postdoctoral students who want to learn more about the latest advances in these highly active areas of research"

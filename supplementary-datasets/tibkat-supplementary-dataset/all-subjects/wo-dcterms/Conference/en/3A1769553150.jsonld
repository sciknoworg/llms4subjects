                "This book presents best selected research papers presented at the Thirteenth International Conference on Applied Mathematics and Mechanics in the Aerospace Industry (AMMAI 2020), held from September 6 to September 13, 2020, at the Alushta Health and Educational Center (The Republic of Crimea). The book is dedicated to solving actual problems of applied mechanics using modern computer technology including smart paradigms. Physical and mathematical models, numerical methods, computational algorithms, and software complexes are discussed, which allow to carry out high-precision mathematical modeling in fluid, gas, and plasma mechanics, in general mechanics, deformable solid mechanics, in strength, destruction and safety of structures, etc. Technologies and software systems that provide effective solutions to the problems at various multi-scale levels are considered. Special attention is paid to the training of highly qualified specialists for the aviation and space industry. The book is recommended for specialists in the field of applied mathematics and mechanics, mathematical modeling, information technologies, and developers of modern applied software systems.",

                "Advancement in design and construction to embrace the impact of rapid global urbanization growth in infrastructure development is inevitable. The proceedings include many smart and green solutions for civil infrastructures, incorporating geotechnical and engineering geology aspects. The articles presented in this volume are attempts made by the researchers and practitioners to address many geotechnical challenges, based on the state-of-the-art practices, innovative technologies, new research results and case histories in construction and design towards safer and cost effective infrastructures. This volume covers a wide range of topics with direct relevance to people within the broad field of geomechanics, including consultants, contractors, academics, materials suppliers and the owners and operators of civil infrastructures. Many papers associated with numerical modeling of transport infrastructure, advanced soil and rock testing, field monitoring, tunnelling, expansive soils, geo-center motion, triaxial and dynamic testing, piles etc. are included. The content is based on the contributions to the 6th GeoChina International Conference on Civil & Transportation Infrastructures: From Engineering to Smart & Green Life Cycle Solutions -- Nanchang, China, 2021."

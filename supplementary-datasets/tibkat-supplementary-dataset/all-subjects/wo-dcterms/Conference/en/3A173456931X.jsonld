            "abstract": "This volume contains new results in the fields of mechatronics systems, mechanics and materials. It relates the latest developments and reflects the experience of the many researchers working in universities, research centers and relevant industries. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The results of their research are covered by four chapters: Control Systems, Robotics, Diagnostics and Mechatronic Systems. The main aim of the book is the interconnection of diverse scientific fields, the cultivation of every possible scientific collaboration, the exchange of views and the promotion of new research targets as well as the further dissemination, dispersion and diffusion of scientific knowledge.  Aimed at scientists and engineers, this volume collects 44 papers from the Special Session on Mechatronic Systems, Mechanics and Materials, held in October 2011 in Jastrzebia Gra, Poland. Contributed by researchers from universities, research centers, and industry in Poland and the Czech Republic, the papers cover control systems, their design and analysis, architecture, decision-making processes, comparison, and examples such as a virtual driver of a hybrid wheeled vehicle. Other examples include a supervisory controller of a ship propulsion plant, automation of a mobile biodiesel production plant, and advanced flight control systems. They also address robotics, with examples like underwater robots, an unmanned ground vehicle, and a walking robot for inspection tasks; diagnostics, models, measurement and recording systems, and other topics; and mechatronic systems, modeling, and dynamics of systems such as an anti-aircraft missile launcher, thermal and humidification subsystems of a fuel cell system, marine vehicles, and off-road vehicles",

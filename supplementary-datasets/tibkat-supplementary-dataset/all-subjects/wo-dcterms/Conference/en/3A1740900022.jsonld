            "title": "Interfaces and Plasticity : Proceedings of the Advanced School Meeting 'Dislocations 96' held in Tozeur, Tunisia, October 1996",
            "abstract": "Dislocations were introduced into crystal physics, and particularly into the theory of plasticity, in 1934. For many years, they were the field of speculation of a small group of specialists, not considered seriously by real physicists and metallurgists. After W.T. Read Jr's fundamental work in 1953 and further developments by Cottrel, Friedel, Frank and Hirsch, dislocations had become part of the working vocabulary of solid-state physics and metallurgy. The present volume concerns the influence of dislocations on mechanical properties, in relation with interfaces in mono- or multi-phased materials. The state of the art of plasticity problems related to interfaces - including diffusion, corrosion, failure, role of interfaces in semi-conductors, superalloys and multi-phased intermetallics - has been studied as well as those related to scale effects. The validity of models and/or simulations has been discussed by lecturers who combined clear definitions of the problems and development of the actual researches.This new book will be useful for all those involved in the research, development, engineering, evaluation and applications of advanced engineering materials",

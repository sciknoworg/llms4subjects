            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).This collection of peer-reviewed papers provided a forum within which researchers, educators, engineers and government officials - involved in the general areas of Environmental Biotechnology and Materials Engineering - could disseminate their latest research results and exchange views on possible future research directions. The 473 most outstanding papers were carefully selected from among the total of 783 submitted works and are presented in this special collection, which covers a wide range of issues related to the state-of-the-art of the progress, made in environmental biotechnology and materials engineering, with regard to the understanding and optimization of various types of treatment process.  This collection of technical papers is a massive (2,377 pages) three-volume set that includes 475 selected presentations originally given during the 2011 International Conference on Environmental Biotechnology and Materials Engineering held in March 2011 in Harbin, China. Because the field of environmental biotechnology encompasses so many varied sub-disciplines, the range of topics is vast. A sampling of topics from the collection includes: degradation of plant cellulose by microwave-catalysis coupling technology, the clustering algorithm study of gene expression data, problems and countermeasures in the ecological protection of the city of Shenyang, cold recycling of waste asphalt pavement in cold regions, the preparation of hydrolyzed carp protein, study of the co-migration of lead with soil colloids under rainfall, biological effects of environmental electromagnetic fields, biosorption of heavy metal ion-uranium, and the optimal location of auto-control valves in water distribution networks. Series editors are Shi and Zuo, Harbin U. of Commerce, China",

            "title": "Comparison of the particle emission behaviour of automotive drum and disc brakes",
            "abstract": "Friction brakes are one of the main sources of PM emissions from cars today. However, due to the electrification of the powertrain, the share of friction brakes in vehicle deceleration is continuously decreasing. Due to the reduced number of braking applications and the lower brake pressure level, the amount of emitted particles also decreases. This is associated with the disadvantage of an increased potential for the formation of rust on the surfaces of the friction materials, which is expected to influence friction and wear. Due to the increasing challenge posed by corroded friction partners, drum brakes are increasingly used to decelerate bat-tery electric (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). In this study, basic investigations on the particle emission behaviour of drum brakes are carried out using an inertia dynamometer (LINK 3900-NVH). To en-sure representative sampling, a constant-volume sampling system is used, which is optimised in terms of transport efficiency and particle distribution. Condensa-tion particle counters (CPC) and filter holders (TX40) are used to determine PN/PM emission factors. CPCs with differently calibrated cut-off are used to evaluate the formation of nanoscale particle formations. In this context, special at-tention is paid to the influence of temperature on the particle formation process. From the comparison between rear-axle disc brake and rear-axle drum brake it could be proven that the predominant part of the wear mass remains within the drum, which affects the size distribution of the emitted particles. The ratio be-tween PM10 and PM2.5 mass-related emissions factors decreases from about 2 (disc brake) to about 1.3 (drum brake). In addition, the emission behaviour is dif-ferentiated via the bedding procedure of the drum brake. To achieve a reproduci-ble emission level, a doubling of the number of cycles (WLTP-brake cycle) is necessary. Due to a higher temperature level, nanoparticles could be detected dur-ing testing of the drum brake, whereby the number-related emission factor (PM2.5) was partly higher than for the disc brake.",

                "This insightful work answers essential questions in family therapy by exploring the ethical use of religion and spirituality in the clinical context. Its justice-informed framework explores how to employ the spiritual as a source of resilience and empowerment as well as counter harmful spiritual and religious influences in situations that cause families and couples stress, particularly relating to gender, sexuality, race, culture, and identity. Powerful case studies show therapists and clients collaborating on meaning-making and comfort in the face of longstanding conflict, acute and chronic illness, estrangement, and loss. Coverage also explores the ethical responsibilities of determining whether beliefs are helpful or harmful to client mental health and offers guidelines for therapists navigating personal biases regarding faith. This vital text: \u00b7 Spotlights the influence of an often-overlooked aspect of mental health \u00b7 Provides detailed examples of religion and spirituality across diverse families and issues \u00b7 Outlines practical strategies for integrating helpful aspects of clients\u2019 relationship with the sacred into treatment \u00b7 Offers a framework for countering harmful aspects of clients\u2019 religious beliefs or practices \u00b7 Includes interventions used with couples, parents/children, and other family units \u00b7 Adds a socially just perspective on the spiritual dimension of mind/body concerns \u00b7 Encourages readers\u2019 professional development and self-reflection Addressing critical issues where belief frequently takes center stage, Socially Just Religious and Spiritual Interventions is an invaluable resource for family therapists, psychotherapists, and other professionals pursuing a socially just, clinically relevant approach to spiritual and religious therapeutic integration"

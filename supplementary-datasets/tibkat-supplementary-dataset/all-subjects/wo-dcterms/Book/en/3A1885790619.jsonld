            "abstract": "This volume focuses on the teaching of English as a foreign language to young learners at primary school. The volume features an introduction that covers essentials of teaching English to young learners from a theoretical, empirical, and neuroscientific perspective while also discussing the notion of a principled mindset, competence development, transcultural learning, the use of materials and literature, and lesson planning. The subsequent contributions cover reading and writing, bilingual programs, the transition from primary to secondary school, storybooks, the importance of self-selected fiction, anti-bias education, ways of encouraging young learners to speak, and professional advice for primary English language educators based on a qualitative analysis of interviews. Based on an international TEFL lecture series, researchers, teacher educators, and practising teachers from Germany, Switzerland, and the United States share their insights into these central issues and offer theoretical concepts for the professional development of (pre-service) primary school English teachers. Practical ideas and examples included in this volume aim to make theoretical constructs accessible and relatable for future teachers of English. The afterword features a look ahead by critically examining future challenges of primary school educators and highlighting (1) the great importance of an early start with English as a foreign language and (2) the need for developing national educational standards. This volume provides a research-based and practice-oriented foundation for (pre-service) English teachers wishing to expand their knowledge and gain an insight into recent developments in foreign language learning theories and concepts. Although mostly aimed at primary school educators, particularly the introductory chapter will be equally relevant for university students or teachers focusing on vocational and secondary school teaching, so that they develop an understanding of specific features of primary English language education and, as concerns secondary school teachers, can contribute to a smooth transition in the fifth grade",

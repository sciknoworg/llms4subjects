            "abstract": "This work systematically compiles eleven outstanding research papers that were presented at the 3rd International Congress on Ethics in Cuenca, University City, Ecuador in November 2022. The Catholic University of Cuenca, beyond hosting the event, is committed to ethics in a holistic way. As such, to deliver this work for the benefit of the community is to expand the debate on it in areas of collective relevance such as face-to-face and online university education, pre-professional practices, professional qualifications, the equity of women workers, nature as a subject of rights, professional conduct, Ethics in Care Committees, the trend, style, and praxis of architectural design, and particularly the role of the university in the construction of an ethical culture from the perspective of students. Thus, this book invites those attending the event and readers to empower themselves with the work in order to strengthen ethics in all its dimensions and in everyday practice",

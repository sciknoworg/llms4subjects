            "abstract": "\"The book addresses the fundamentals and main applications of telecommunication technologies in smart grids. The book is aimed at engineers and technical professionals interested or needing to work in power systems. Aimed at power systems and telecommunications engineers, it explains what smart grids are, and how, where, and which telecommunications are needed to solve the different challenges around smart grids. For power engineers it will explain the main concepts of telecommunications, and how they are applied to the different domains of the smart grid. For telecommunication engineers needing to understand power systems, it will explain how telecommunications need to be adapted, and which telecommunication systems and services are applicable to this domain. The approach of the book will be to simplify the complexity of both smart grids and telecommunications, removing the technical complexities and offering a simplified vision of smart grids with sufficient coverage of the latest advances in the field. Its focuses on helping engineers in understanding the basic telecommunication concepts, identifying the relevant smart grid use cases, and selecting the telecommunication systems and services that today and tomorrow will cover the needs of smart grids. Special attention will be placed on Powerline (PLC), mobile communications (4G and 5G) and the ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions as a very specific differential aspect.\"--",

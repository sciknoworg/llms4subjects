            "abstract": "Fake news, alternative facts, post truth\u2014terms all too familiar to anyone in U.S. political culture and concepts at the core of Dana L. Cloud\u2019s new book, Reality Bites, which explores truth claims in contemporary political rhetoric in the face of widespread skepticism regarding the utility, ethics, and viability of an empirical standard for political truths. Cloud observes how appeals to truth often assume\u2014mistakenly\u2014that it is a matter of simple representation of facts. However, since neither fact-checking nor \u201ctruthiness\u201d can respond meaningfully to this problem, she argues for a rhetorical realism\u2014the idea that communicators can bring knowledge from particular perspectives and experiences into the domain of common sense.Through a series of case studies\u2014including the PolitiFact fact-checking project, the Planned Parenthood \u201cselling baby parts\u201d scandal, the Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden cases, Neil DeGrasse Tyson\u2019s Cosmos, the rhetoric of Thomas Paine and the American Revolution, and the Black Lives Matter movement\u2014Cloud advocates for the usefulness of narrative, myth, embodiment, affect, and spectacle in creating accountability in contemporary U.S. political rhetoric. If dominant reality \u201cbites\u201d\u2014in being oppressive and exploitative\u2014it is time, Cloud argues, for those in the reality-based community to \u201cbite back.\u201d",

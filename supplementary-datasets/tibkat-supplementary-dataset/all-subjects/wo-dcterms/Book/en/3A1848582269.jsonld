            "abstract": "\"Life and space have been the most fascinating scientific concepts that I used to cogitate from my childhood; watching the \"Star Trek\" series or thinking on the way all living organisms have evolved from non-living atoms and molecules. As a civil engineer with numerical skills, however, it may seem quite unusual to get involved with biological problems. Nevertheless, the computational mechanics has bridged over the different pillars of science, from buildings to aerospace structures, and from spectacular suspension bridges to intelligent nano additives in biological systems. It all started about a decade ago, when my former student, Shahrokh Shahi, began his thesis endeavour on multiscale biomechanics. After his graduation, we planned for a book on the subject, although he had to separate from the project to follow his future quests. Biomechanics is primarily used to study the wide range of mechanical responses of biosystems; from biomolecules scales up to the organ and body levels, and from routine medical procedures to synthesized tissues. The wealth of well-developed mathematical and numerical methods of solving general engineering and physical problems is now available to assist the clinical staff and medical industries in assessing the existing procedures and products or to propose new engineered designs and concepts for future research and development. I have tried to provide the theoretical and computational bases of biomechanics in this textbook and to present my small contribution to encourage the young talents to further advance the numerical capabilities for analysis of biomechanical applications. The book, which can be regarded as an introduction to the multiscale biomechanics, is composed of three parts. The preliminary part is meant to provide an introduction and insight on the general concept of the biomechanics and the wide variety of biological problems that can be solved numerically through the single and multiscale methods. Part II is dedicated to analytical and numerical bases. In its first set of chapters, the general concepts of continuum mechanics associated with solid materials, fluid flow and diffusion problems are provided. The second set of chapters cover the basics of numerical analysis methods, including the finite element method, the extended finite element method, the isogeometeric analysis, the principles of meshless methods, and the variable node element. The final chapter of part II discusses the multiscale methods. It begins by examining the homogenization technique. Then, the atomistic/molecular dynamics and statistical mechanics are discussed in detail. The sequential multiscale method is thoroughly discussed by a sample case, which spans the extremely wide range of atomistic simulations, nanoscale analysis, macroscale computations, micro scale investigation and macro scale study. The multiscale chapter is concluded by the comprehensive review of the concurrent multiscale schemes. Part III is dedicated to discussions on single and multiscale biomechanical simulations. Its first chapter is devoted to the modelling of soft tissues. It begins with explaining the composition and physiology of soft tissues and their macro and micro hyperelastic constitutive laws. This chapter includes several single and multiscale simulations of soft tissue applications, including damaged tissues, aortic heart valve, skin damage, arterial wall degradation, wound healing and the viscoelastic response of brain. The next chapter of this part is dedicated to hard tissues, and briefly explains the composition of bones and the necessary mechanical models. A number of single and multiscale simulations are presented to provide more insight into the way hard tissue biomechanical studies are performed. The chapter closes by a discussion on the healing processes of hard tissues. Part III is concluded by a brief complementary chapter on a number of supplementary topics, covering the principles of stenting simulations, multiscale modelling of eye, the concept of a shape memory polymer drug delivery system and an introduction to the artificial intelligence and deep learning in biomechanical applications.\"",

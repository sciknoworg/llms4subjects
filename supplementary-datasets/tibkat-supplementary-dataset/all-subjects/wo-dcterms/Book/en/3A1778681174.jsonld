            "title": "Advancing Desalination",
            "abstract": "This book is a companion volume to two published in 2011 by INTECH titled \u201cDesalination, Trends and Technologies\u201d and \u201cExpanding Issues in Desalination\u201d. The term \u201cdesalination\u201d used in this series is in the broadest sense of the removal of dissolved, suspended, visible and invisible impurities in seawater, brackish water and wastewater. The purpose of desalination is to make water drinkable, or pure enough for industrial applications like in the processes for the production of steam, power, pharmaceuticals and microelectronics, or simply for attaining acceptable qualities for discharge back into the environment. This volume touches on Membranes and Systems, Solar Desalination, Reverse Osmosis Process Chemistry and Control, Drinking Water Quality, and Selective Waste Product Removal. The value of these volumes on the vast topic of desalination is to present the landscape to students, teachers and practitioners, with key concepts and keywords useful in gathering publications through internet search engines. The technologies of desalination of water are advancing as rapidly as the cry of human kind for more availability of quality water supply while minimizing environmental pollution. Contributions to the knowledge-base of desalination are expected to continue to grow exponentially in the coming years",

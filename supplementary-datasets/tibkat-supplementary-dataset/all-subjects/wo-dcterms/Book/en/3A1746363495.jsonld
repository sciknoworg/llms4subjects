                "This book examines the State\u2019s duty to protect human rights in Asia amidst rising concern over the human rights impact of business organisations in the region, a topic which has hitherto been understudied. It analyses a range of inter-connected issues: the advent of international standards, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the challenges inherent in the formulation of National Action Plans on business and human rights, the need for improved legislation and policies, access to remedies, and conflicts with indigenous peoples over business activities. The book also covers innovative themes such as BHR in the era of smart cities, ethical consumer behavior, and a human rights management system, which are emerging areas of enquiry in this field concluding with a range of critical issues to be addressed, including the need for an assessment of COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on BHR in Asia and beyond. This book is part of Asia Centre\u2019s exploration of the nascent regional human rights architecture that is facing significant obstacles in protecting human rights and showcases the progress achieved and the ongoing challenges across Asia. James Gomez is Regional Director, Asia Centre (Bangkok, Thailand and Johor Bahru, Malaysia), a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to create human rights impact in the region. Dr. Gomez is a communications and human rights specialist having served in different academic and leadership roles in the last 25 years, working for international NGOs, intergovernmental organizations, public and private universities, research institutes and think-tanks. He represents the Centre in media and public speaking engagements and builds relationships with key stakeholders around the world. Robin Ramcharan is Executive Director, Asia Centre, Bangkok, Thailand. He specialises in human rights, intellectual property and security issues in Southeast Asia. Dr. Ramcharan is also Professor of International Relations with an extensive teaching and publications record. He has worked over the past two decades in the not-for-profit sector, the private sector, international organisations, and in research institutes and think-tanks.

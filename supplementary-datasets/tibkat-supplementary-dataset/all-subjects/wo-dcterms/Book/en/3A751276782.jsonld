                "The XIIIth Bialowieza Summer Workshop was held from July 9 to 15, 1994. While still within the general framework of Differential Geometric Methods in Physics, the XnIth Workshop was expanded in scope to include quantum groups, q-deformations and non-commutative geometry. It is expected that lectures on these topics will now become an integral part of future workshops. In the more traditional areas, lectures were devoted to topics in quantization, field theory, group representations, coherent states, complex and Poisson structures, the Berry phase, graded contractions and some infinite-dimensional systems. Those of us who have taken part in the evolution of the workshops over the years, feel a good measure of satisfaction with the excellent quality of the papers presented, in particular the mathematical rigour and novelty. Each year a significant number of new results are presented and future directions of research are discussed. Their freshness and immediacy inevitably leads to intense discussions and an exchange of ideas in an informal and physically charming environment. The present workshop also had a higher attendance than its predecessors, with ap\u00ad proximately 65 registered participants. As usual, there was a large number of graduate students and young researchers among them."

                "This book compiles the latest research, development, and application of VRF systems with contributions from various experts who pioneered and contributed to the development of the VRF system. This book presents the fundamental issues related to the real application and behaviour of the VRF system based on the long-term monitoring of the installed system. With our experience of pandemic which COVID-19 is an airborne, the spread of the virus is very fast. With this, the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is a major player in the maintenance and control of indoor environment to minimize the spread of the virus. As the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system is a versatile HVAC system in which it can operate at different conditions, the application of the VRF system is very important to control the indoor environmental conditions. Thus, the publication of this book is important with the present situation and the future possible situation which the control of indoor spaces is very important. With this, this book will serve as a reference for building designer, contractors, building regulators and students."

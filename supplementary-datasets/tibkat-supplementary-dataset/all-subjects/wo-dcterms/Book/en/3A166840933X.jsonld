                "\"Plant Pathogens: Detection and Management for Sustainable Agriculture addresses the most critical issues in the management of emerging diseases throughout the world. Experts in plant pathology from internationally renowned institutes share their research and examine key literature on vital issues in pathogen disease diagnosis and management. They look at both traditional pathology as well as new and advanced biotechnological and molecular diagnosis approaches. This book is divided into four parts, covering viral and fungal disease detection and management, nematode diseases and management, bio-control, and biotechnological approaches and impact of climate change. The authors look at the challenges of crop protection against diseases caused by plant pathogens for the most economically important crops, including fruits, vegetables, and cereals. The establishment and management of plant diseases using conventional and eco-friendly methods are discussed with an emphasis on the use of beneficial microbes and modern biotechnological approaches. Plant Pathogens: Detection and Management for Sustainable Agriculture focuses on expert disease diagnosis and integrated management practices with molecular diagnostic techniques to achieve disease free-plants from a wide array of pathogens. The volume will be a valuable source of information for those involved with and studying plant pathology and crop disease management\"--",

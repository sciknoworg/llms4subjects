            "abstract": "In An Overview of the Pre-suppression Society of Jesus in Spain, Patricia W. Manning offers a survey of the Society of Jesus in Spain from its origins in Ignatius of Loyola\u2019s early preaching to the aftereffects of its expulsion. Rather than nurture the nascent order, Loyola\u2019s homeland was often ambivalent. His pre-Jesuit freelance sermonizing prompted investigations. The young Society confronted indifference and interference from the Spanish monarchy and outright opposition from other religious orders. This essay outlines the order\u2019s ministerial and pedagogical activities, its relationship with women and with royal institutions, including the Spanish Inquisition, and Spanish members\u2019 roles in theological debates concerning casuistry, free will, and the immaculate conception. It also considers the impact of Jesuits\u2019 non-religious writings. Readership: Readers interested in the Society of Jesus, textual production by Jesuits, the Society\u2019s ties to women, early modern theological polemics, and early modern Spain, including undergraduate and graduate students",

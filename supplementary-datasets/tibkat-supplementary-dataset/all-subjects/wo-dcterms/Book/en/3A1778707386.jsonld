            "abstract": "During last couple of years there has been an increasing recognition that problems arising in biology or related to medicine really need a multidisciplinary approach. For this reason some special branches of both applied theoretical physics and mathematics have recently emerged such as biomechanics, mechanobiology, mathematical biology, biothermodynamics. This first section of the book, General notes on biomechanics and mechanobiology, comprises from theoretical contributions to Biomechanics often providing hypothesis or rationale for a given phenomenon that experiment or clinical study cannot provide. It deals with mechanical properties of living cells and tissues, mechanobiology of fracture healing or evolution of locomotor trends in extinct terrestrial giants. The second section, Biomechanical modelling, is devoted to the rapidly growing field of biomechanical models and modelling approaches to improve our understanding about processes in human body. The last section called Locomotion and joint biomechanics is a collection of works on description and analysis of human locomotion, joint stability and acting forces",

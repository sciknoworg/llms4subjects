            "abstract": "The success of ID projects goes beyond technology-people need to understand and trust the ID system, and governments require information to monitor, evaluate, and improve implementation. If a system is poorly designed and does not reflect the needs and views of the communities it is intended to serve, this can lead to inefficient solutions, trust deficits, low adoption, and exclusion of marginalized groups. Systematic engagement can help improve outcomes for both government and population by fostering confidence and providing early identification of potential problems. The importance of developing ID systems based on inclusion, trust, accountability, and transparency has been recognized by the international community in the Principles on Identification for Sustainable Development. This guidance note aims to inform practitioners undertaking civil registration and ID system projects about the benefits and importance of proactively and meaningfully engaging with civil society organizations (CSOs). Practitioners will also be equipped with leading practice tools and resources to effectively engage CSOs from design to deployment. The information contained in this note is intended to complement World Bank frameworks on stakeholder engagement, which explain how to consult intended beneficiaries and adversely affected populations as part of the planning, design, and implementation of ID projects. This discussion focuses on the specifics of engaging with CSOs, following the request for further guidance formulated by CSOs and ID authorities themselves; these organizations act as an important intermediary to provide a voice to communities and segments of the population that lack a platform or sufficient organization to influence public decisions",

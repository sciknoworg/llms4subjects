            "abstract": "\"The contribution of Edgar H. Schein to the field of management, organization studies and applied behavioural science is both extensive and deep. For almost seventy years he has creatively and systematically shaped theory and practice in areas including organization development and change, career dynamics, the cultural dynamics of complex systems, leadership, process consultation and the clinical inquiry/research paradigm. He has written extensively on the process of organizational change and framed the construct of the clinical approach to research. With such an extensive corpus over such a long period, Schein been termed a \"transcendent thought leader\" and it is in this spirit that a volume exploring his work offer a contribution how scholars and practitioner can come to understand their engagement in organizations. This singular volume is adopting a reflective perspective on the work of Edgar Schein as a social scientist and shows how he developed his craft as an engaged organizational scholar-practitioner through reflexive attention to his experience in working with managers and organizations and generating knowledge out of action. The intended contribution is to both present Schein's work to students and scholars of organization studies and to offer a reflexive methodological framework to engaged scholar-practitioner in any field\"--",

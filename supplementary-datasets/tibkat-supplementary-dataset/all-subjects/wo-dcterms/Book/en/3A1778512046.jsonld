            "abstract": "\u2018Thank you for your order, Mr Mainframe Customer. The cost is \u00a35 million and the lead-time for manufacture will be two years. In the meantime you will have to build a special computer centre to our specification. For our part, our project team will help you recruit and train potential programmers and we shall advise on how you might use the system.\u2019 How different from today when the customer will want to see a specific application running before he puts a hand in his/her pocket. Chris Yardley lived the changes as a computer salesman and tells his story of a career living and working in five countries. Warts and all. The ecstasies, the heartbreaks and idiocies of major corporations. His career was not a planned one. In a growing industry, opportunities presented themselves and Chris believes he grasped every one presented. Having written his story, he has had every chapter verified by at least one person who features in that narrative. His respondents have universally endorsed the facts with comments such as \u2018Wow, I\u2019d forgotten most of that\u2019. \u2018You have a fantastic memory.\u2019 \u2018I never knew before the full facts of what happened.\u2019 \u2018How have you remembered all the circumstances?\u2019 \u2018It really is a people business.\u2019 His career was not a planned one.

            "abstract": "Gradually emerged in England in the aftermath of the struggle between the House of Commons and the Crown, parliamentarism has widely circulated abroad, has been praised by many for its alleged capacity to resist authoritarianism, and is mainly concentrated in Europe as well as in former UK colonies. Likewise, presidentialism, originated for the \ufb01rst time from the US Constitution of 1787, is not a monolithic category. Committees, in particular the permanent ones, have famously been labelled as the \u201cbackbones\u201d of legislatures. In law-making, the strength of committees is what de\ufb01nes the strength of a parliamentary institution, in terms of capacity to shape the content of legislation and to oversee the executive. In presidential regimes, the capacity of the Parliament to in\ufb02uence the budget seems higher, also due to the lack of con\ufb01dence votes to be used by the executive as a leverage to pressure the legislature on budgetary procedures",

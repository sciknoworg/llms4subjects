                "\"Amid sweeping conversations about the future of artificial intelligence and its impact on US industry and economy, one economic domain has remained relatively insulated from the discussion: health care. How is it possible that an industry so bemoaned for inefficiency and expense, an industry so large that it now makes up a quarter of the US economy, could escape the efficiency- and cost-driven disruptions of AI? How are doctor's offices still relying on fax machines in the age of driverless cars? Why is it the one industry where we'd like to see AI try some things the one that machines can't seem to infiltrate? The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: Health Care Challenges convenes contributions from health economists, physicians, philosophers, and legal scholars to identify the primary barriers to entry for AI in America's biggest industry. Across original papers and wide-ranging written responses, they find five domains of barriers: incentives; management; data availability; regulation. They also find evidence of real opportunity: AI has promise to improve outcomes and lower costs, and if paths to intervention are seized upon, improvements will follow\"--",
                "A timely investigation of the potential economic effects, both realized and unrealized, of artificial intelligence within the United States healthcare system. In sweeping conversations about the impact of artificial intelligence on many sectors of the economy, healthcare has received relatively little attention. Yet it seems unlikely that an industry that represents nearly one-fifth of the economy could escape the efficiency and cost-driven disruptions of AI. The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: Health Care Challenges brings together contributions from health economists, physicians, philosophers, and scholars in law, public health, and machine learning to identify the primary barriers to entry of AI in the healthcare sector. Across original papers and in wide-ranging responses, the contributors analyze barriers of four types: incentives, management, data availability, and regulation. They also suggest that AI has the potential to improve outcomes and lower costs. Understanding both the benefits of and barriers to AI adoption is essential for designing policies that will affect the evolution of the healthcare system"

Thesedangers are highest where water is scarce and governance (at the domestic orinternational levels) is poor.\" Asia provides the most powerful illustrationof water security risks, with significant challenges that affect both the watersupply and demand sides, as well as important governance shortcomings. While thereare enormous disparities across Asia in terms of this issue, the continent's overallwater outlook is discouraging.\" Much of Asia suffers from the consequences ofinvestments in supply-side water infrastructure projects that have emphasised giganticscale over the efficient use of water. These investments have often been madewithout adequate consideration of their economic, social, diplomatic andenvironmental costs, nor with much concern for long-term impact.\" The rapidpace and massive scale of Asian urbanisation are placing new stresses on waterdemand, because city dwellers consume more waterthan their rural counterparts.\" ater experts and practitioners across Asia are fully aware of the continent's manyproblems and are diligently working to overcome them. There will be no easyfix, however, because of Asia's massive scale plus significant financial, political and institutional obstacles. As in other domains, there is no substitute for good governance. Widespread progress on thecontinent will occur when local, regional, and national leaders use good data andinformation to make the right decisions to manage water resources smartly andcooperatively over the long run",

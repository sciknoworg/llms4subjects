                "\"Elgar Research Agendas outline the future of research in a given area. Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. This insightful Research Agenda considers the current state of research into workplace stress and wellbeing and maps an innovative programme for future investigation that can advance understanding of the interrelationships between work and wellbeing. Bringing together international contributors to outline the field, the book examines the various costs and impacts of workplace stress on employers and employees. Chapters address key features of the workplace that influence employee wellbeing, including technology use, leadership, work-family relationships and aggression, as well as the unique contemporary effects of Covid-19 on wellbeing. Identifying both substantive and methodological questions that remain unanswered, the book considers the benefits of intervention strategies that are designed to enhance individual wellbeing in the workplace. Offering a unique picture of the field, this timely book is crucial reading for researchers and graduate students focused on work and wellbeing who are looking for new and innovative avenues for research. Managers and other practitioners will also benefit from its practical insights into the challenges posed by workplace stress and the potential strategies for managing stress\"--",

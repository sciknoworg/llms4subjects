                "The papers contained in this volume are an indication of the topics th discussed and the interests of the participants of The 9 International Conference on Probability in Banach Spaces, held at Sandjberg, Denmark, August 16-21, 1993. A glance at the table of contents indicates the broad range of topics covered at this conference. What defines research in this field is not so much the topics considered but the generality of the ques\u00ad tions that are asked. The goal is to examine the behavior of large classes of stochastic processes and to describe it in terms of a few simple prop\u00ad erties that the processes share. The reward of research like this is that occasionally one can gain deep insight, even about familiar processes, by stripping away details, that in hindsight turn out to be extraneous. A good understanding about the disciplines involved in this field can be obtained from the recent book, Probability in Banach Spaces, Springer-Verlag, by M. Ledoux and M. Thlagrand. On page 5, of this book, there is a list of previous conferences in probability in Banach spaces, including the other eight international conferences. One can see that research in this field over the last twenty years has contributed significantly to knowledge in probability and has had important applications in many other branches of mathematics, most notably in statistics and functional analysis.",

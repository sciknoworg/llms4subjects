            "abstract": "\"This book overviews recent advances in the development of lubricants and their usage in different tribological systems, starting from nanoscale contacts up to macroscale assemblies with specific focus on sustainable green lubrication choices including base fluids. Further, it covers advances and optimization of new type of lubrication systems according to their usage in various tribological systems as gears, bearings, micro-electromechanical systems, and production equipment. Furthermore, the few examples and case studies about utilization of synthetic lubricants in bearings, gears, dental and so forth has been included. Features: explores information on the present and future of sustainable lubricants due to its accelerated demands in industries, provides conceptual overview of lubricant application in manufacturing and automobile industries, discusses lubricants used in the micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), tribo-systems under extreme conditions and for biomedical applications, and reviews information about various types of additives and their role in lubricants, and their cost effectiveness. This text also includes case studies related to journal-bearing/gear drive systems. Finally, this shortform book is geared towards students and researchers in mechanical engineering, automobile engineering, chemical engineering and chemistry, manufacturing, mechanical, materials and metallurgy\"--",

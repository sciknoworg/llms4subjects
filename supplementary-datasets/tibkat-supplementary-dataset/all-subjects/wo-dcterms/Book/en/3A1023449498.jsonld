                "'The economics of immigration literature has grown in the last decade to reflect the complexity of economic issues arising from international migration. This collection is a comprehensive research resource which allows both the student and scholar to keep abreast with traditional topics and emerging economic issues in this field.'--Don De Voretz, Simon Fraser University, Canada. This essential collection brings together the most important papers covering the wide range of themes within the evolving field of the economics of international migration. The editors have selected seminal papers, published between 2000 and 2011, by leading academics which analyse immigration issues among the major destination countries across the globe. This timely two-volume set, along with an original introduction by the editors, will be of great value to students, academics and practitioners interested in the growing subject of international migration",

                "This book examines the extent to which the environment is addressed in the sustainability plans of Canadian cities. It assesses if and to what extent select leading environmental priorities are addressed in the sustainability plans of sixteen Canadian cities, followed by analysis of efforts towards each priority. It scores and ranks cities against each environmental priority and highlights what makes some cities lead and others lag in environmental sustainability. The book unravels the complexity, similarities, and differences in environmental sustainability planning across major cities in Canada. The book examines the policies that are working, who\u2019s leading, and which environmental priorities support the sustainable city model. This book makes a timely contribution to the on-going debate regarding the ways and means to become a sustainable city. It reflects the on-going sustainable development discourse and deliberations to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. It cut across many SDGs in particular SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities and provides a unique focus on environmental priorities within urban sustainability planning. This book is an invaluable resource for both scholars and practitioners at local, regional, national, and global scales.

                "\"The Global Financial Crisis and later crises clearly showed serious challenges faced by global capitalism in last decades. Focusing on successes and failures of contemporary state-led developmental experiments around the world this book provides a new fresh view on perspectives for economic development in dramatically changing world.\" --Andrei Yakovlev, HSE Institute for Industrial and Market Studies & Davis Center at Harvard University (United States) \"The volume offers a rich collection of inspiring readings to academics, policy makers, and students interested in the theories and paths of latecomer development. Its chapters cover a large variety of latecomer trajectories from China to Turkey, and from Central and Eastern Europe to Zimbabwe. The volume captures a historical turning point at which hegemony is challenged, development paths are altered, and the future is less predictable than ever.\" --B\u00e9la Greskovits, Central European University, Vienna (Austria) This volume is the continuation of our research on economic and developmental policy-making in the global semi-periphery in the post-crisis cycle (see our two recently published volumes titled \u2018Market-Liberalism and Economic Patriotism in Capitalist Systems\u2019 edited by Ger\u0151cs and Szanyi, 2019, Palgrave Macmillan and \u2018The Post-Crisis Developmental State \u2013 Perspectives from the Global Periphery\u2019 edited by Ger\u0151cs and Ricz, 2021). Our new volume aims to be a contribution to the analysis of emerging market economies\u2019 alternative development trajectories, as we explore the new perspectives on semi-peripheral dependent development since the Global Financial Crisis and especially amidst the new global pandemic, the COVID-19. The volume extends on topics inherently linked to the changing global context and theoretical framework of latecomer development aiming at expanding both thematic and regional focus of Comparative Capitalism research.

            "title": "Natural Gas : Extraction to End Use",
            "abstract": "Natural gas has traditionally been used as a feedstock for the chemical industry, and as a fuel for process and space heating. Recent advances in exploration, drilling techniques and hydraulic fracturing have made it possible for natural gas to become available in abundance (as of 2012). As natural gas displaces traditional petroleum use in various sectors, a certain amount of disruption is likely. In such a changing landscape, this book tries to chronicle the state-of-the-art in various aspects of natural gas: exploration, drilling, gas processing, storage, distribution, end use and finally the impact on financial markets. Review articles as well as research papers contributed by leading authorities around the world comprise individual chapters of this book. Modeling approaches, as well as, recent advances in specific natural gas technologies are covered in detail",

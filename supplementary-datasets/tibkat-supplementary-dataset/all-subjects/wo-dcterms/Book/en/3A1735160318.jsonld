                "\"Elgar Research Agendas outline the future of research in a given area. Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. This exciting Research Agenda expertly addresses the question: What will be important within the family business field and for family businesses in practice over the next decade? Top international contributors explore farsighted theories, methods and topics, often taking a multi-disciplinary approach in order to outline the potential routes for further advancing family business research. Chapters cover the significance of new family trends, entrepreneurial legacy, board diversity, spatial-familiness, corruption, innovation and digital business transformation, challenging core assumptions surrounding the family business phenomenon and mapping the future of the discipline. A Research Agenda for Family Business will prove a stimulating read for family business and entrepreneurship scholars, as well as academics focusing on strategy, HR, organisational behaviour and corporate governance. Practitioners will also find this book valuable for reflecting on challenges that they are facing and navigating developments in the family business field\"--"

            "abstract": "The world of presences is simulated, presented and represented on digital environments. In the context of digital-virtual communication, and from the recent transformations on their supports, information multimodal collections move to a state in which informational subjects\u2019 access to information can be facilitated and expanded.  In such a universe, represented information and data need conceptual and technical treatments that respect the nature and particularities of the media and languages that transit through them. In addition, as they are processed on a fragile medium such as the digital medium, information encoded on electronic media also needs procedures and curation aimed at its integral preservation.  In Information Science, the set of continuous and iterative procedures aimed at meeting the demands of curation to optimize access and preservation is named Digital Curation: a complex of processes that range from the initial design and conceptualization, to metadata designation, appraisal for preservation or disposal decisions, transformation, access, sharing and re-appraisal of digital objects.  When it comes to gender issues, conditions are more acute as the need for Digital Curation becomes more pressing when we are faced with the dramatic events concerning its multiple territories. In them, information must be processed with the socio-cultural purpose of creating strategies and instruments to overcome numerous challenges and current injustices.  The book Digital Curation and Gender in Information Science: access and preservation addresses, through the combined vision of authors from the national and international panorama, issues concerning some gender issues in the perspective of improvements provided by Digital Curation actions and the particulatiries of preservtion and acces that apply.  This book is the result os discussions and collaborations intiated in 2020, the period one of the organizers was, as a Visiting Professor, at Universidade Carlos III de Madrid, grated by Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (Capes), under the Capes-Print Program, No. 88887.310463/2018-00, International Cooperation Project No. 88887.468796/2019-00. We thank Capes for providing the opportunity for meetings with the involved scholars and for funding this collection",

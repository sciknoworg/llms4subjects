                "\u201cThis book provides a thorough and well needed analysis of the dynamics of power in Central Asian republics. By focusing on the role played by neopatrimonialism, these contributions are able to shed light on the fundamental features of governance in the \u201cStans\u201d: clientelism, corruption, crony capitalism, concentration of power in the hands of a closed circle of ruling elites and the absence of democracy. A must read for any scholars studying this part of the world.\u201d \u2013 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Caron, Associate professor in Political Science and International Relations at Nazarbayev University This book adopts a sociological approach in understanding how power structures emerged in Central Asia since the Soviet collapse. The independencies in Central Asia did not happen as a consequence of a nationalist struggle, but because the USSR imploded. Thus, instead of the elites being replaced, the same Soviet elites who had competed for power in the previous system continued to do so in the new one, which they had to build, adapting themselves and the system to their needs. Additionally, the social movements and capacity to mobilize the people were very weak in the new Central Asian states. For this reason, the configuration of the new systems was the product of a competition for power between a very small number of elites who did not have to answer to the people and their demands. Thus, the new power regimes acquired a strong neopatrimonial component. Analyzing the structure of societies, economies and polities of post-socialist states, this book will be of great interest to scholars of Central Asia, to sociologists, and to scholars of China's rise. Ferran Izquierdo-Brichs is Professor on International Relations at Autonomous University of Barcelona. His research is focused on the Sociology of power and the Arab and Muslim world. Francesc Serra-Massansalvador is lecturer on International Relations at Autonomous University of Barcelona. His research focuses on Russia's foreign policy and its relations with the EU, national minorities, ethnic conflicts and human rights in the post-Soviet space.",

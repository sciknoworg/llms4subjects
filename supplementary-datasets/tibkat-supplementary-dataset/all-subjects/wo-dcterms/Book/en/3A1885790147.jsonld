            "abstract": "The demand for advanced materials with complex shapes and perfectly adapted to a specific application in industry is becoming more complex and more challenging every day. The use of fast and eco-friendly sintering technologies to produce materials is a necessary challenge in the next few years. Therefore, advanced ceramic materials without defects, with exceptional properties and adapted to new demands of the market, are the future of this emerging industry. A challenging issue in this field is reducing, reusing, and recycling, and how the ceramic industry can become greener. Sustainability of the planet is not an option, it is an obligation, and scientists must change the future of industry with new techniques, new processing, and new challenges around ceramic materials. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of ceramic materials in an easy-to-follow format and based on processes and techniques that focus on the most important evidence-based advances in this critically important area",

            "abstract": "\"The next time you want to integrate engineering practices into your classes, consider this book your own personal idea-starter. The 13 units in Creating Engineering Design Challenges provide innovative ways to make science and math relevant to middle and high school students through challenge-based learning and the engineering design process. Content areas include biology, chemistry, physical science, Earth science, and environmental science. Topics range from developing a recipe for cement to implementing geocaching to calculating accurate aim with slingshots and water balloons. You can be sure the units are classroom-ready because they were contributed by the same teachers who developed, used, and revised them. The teachers were participants in the Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Math and Science program, a project funded by the National Science Foundation. They provide detailed accounts of their units as well as lesson plans and handouts. The book also offers guidance on fostering professional development to support and grow your school's engineering education practice. Creating Engineering Design Challenges can help you change your classroom environment, empower students, and move toward a more student-centered classroom culture that leads to deeper learning\"--",

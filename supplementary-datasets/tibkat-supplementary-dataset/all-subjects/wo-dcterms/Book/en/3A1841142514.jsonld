            "abstract": "Progress in Africa\u2019s economic growth in the new millennium has been uneven across countries, and has not translated into structural transformation. The same can be said about the evolving China\u2013Africa economic relations. Although economic ties between China and Africa have made a positive contribution, the impact of this dynamic engagement has been uneven, shaped by variations in strategic approach, policy ownership, and implementation capacity among African governments. As China undergoes major economic rebalancing to upgrade to an innovation-driven economy, this is bound to affect China\u2013Africa relations, offering both opportunities and challenges. Authored by leading scholars on Africa, China, and China\u2013Africa relations, this volume brings together stimulating and thought-provoking perspectives, and deeper analyses on the evolving China\u2013Africa relations. Focusing on Africa\u2019s economic development, the volume looks at core areas of structural transformation: productive investment and industrialization, international trade, infrastructure development, and financing. China\u2013Africa relations are considered in the context of the global division of labour and power, and the particular role of both China and the continent of Africa in the evolving global hierarchy. This volume seeks to fill the gap in the existing literature, steer policy and scholarly debate on the progress and trajectory of China\u2013Africa cooperation, and analyse China\u2019s development path as a source of learning for Africa",

            "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks, due to their various applications in many fields and limited power consumption, have attracted much attention recently. Most previous methods have focused on providing energy-saving strategies to elevate the lifetime of sensor networks. Another aggressive but different approach is to wirelessly recharge sensor nodes to increase the lifetime of the sensor networks. This book collects articles that address state-of-the-art technologies and new developments for wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), including the latest hot topics such as charger deployment, charger scheduling, wireless energy transfer, mobile charger design, energy-harvesting technique, and energy provisioning. We believe that the accepted articles present the most up-to-date progress in algorithms and theory for robust wireless sensor networks with respect to different networking problems",

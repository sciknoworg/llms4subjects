            "abstract": "The scientific community has made significant progress in our molecular understanding of sporadic and hereditary colorectal carcinogenesis and progression. Thie pertains to, e.g., the discovery of (mutated) oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, microsatellite instabilities, modifications in DNA repair, cellular aging, signaling cascades, genomic, epigenetic, transcriptional, translational, and protein modifications, as well as microbiotic factors and further parameters. Progression and metastasis have been more intensively studied, especially during recent years, leading to an intensified knowledge on molecular protagonists and microenvironmental interactions contributing to invasion, dissemination, and metastasis; still, more concerted efforts need to be made to better understand issues such as metastasis to different sites or the metastatic heterogeneity of single cells. Nevertheless, based on actual discoveries, personalized medicine, together with highly interdisciplinary therapeutic strategies combining advanced levels of surgical techniques, oncology, and radiation in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or palliative settings, has started to improve the clinical prognosis of individual patients with colorectal cancer. The present Special Issue features articles of excellent international experts with the latest data in the fields mentioned. With this Special Issue, we aim to deepen discussions amongst colleagues in all kinds of disciplines working on this disease and to intensify interdisciplinary collaborations aimed at an ultimate understanding of strategies to defeat and prevent, colorectal cancer, and its progression",

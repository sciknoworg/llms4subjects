            "title": "Plasma Nanoengineering and Nanofabrication",
            "abstract": "With the recent advances in nanotechnology, plasma nanofabrication has become an exciting new niche because plasma-based approaches can deliver unique structures at the nanoscale that cannot be achieved by other techniques and/or in a more economical and environmentally friendly manner. Over the last decade, there have been exiting breakthroughs in the utilization of plasma processes in the fabrication of a rich diversity of nanomaterials and nanoengineered coatings. Examples include nanowires, nanotubes, nanoparticles, and nanotextured coatings. Some of these materials can simply not be derived by conventional means while many others have remarkable plasma-induced properties setting them apart from their traditional analogue. These materials are revolutionizing a spectrum of fields, ranging from electronics to biology and medicine. The goal of this Book is to present some of the latest advances in the fields of plasma assisted nanoengineering and nanofabrication and their application to modern technologies. In addition, the Book aims at highlighting current challenges and obstacles that lie on the path to fully understand the fundamental physical phenomena underlying the plasma facilitated fabrication of nanomaterials. Further, this Book intends to provide guidance to researchers in the field and inform the community of exciting future directions",

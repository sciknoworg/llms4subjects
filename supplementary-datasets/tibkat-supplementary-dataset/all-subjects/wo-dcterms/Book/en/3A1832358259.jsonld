            "abstract": "Meat composition and quality are not independent of the effects of animal production systems. This is important-especially as we transition into a future where meat production, quality, and value are considered within the context of sustainable feed and supplementation selection, the enhanced management of animal genetics and husbandry practices, and the improved processing and packaging of meat products. In this book, we have presented a curated collection of research investigating animal production systems and strategies for meat processing with innovative applications to the delivery of meat products that match consumer demands (i.e., from farm to fork). This book is a valuable resource to animal and food scientists, students of agricultural science, livestock producers and farmers, as well as readers with an interest in the efficient and ethical conversion of animals into meat products for human consumption",

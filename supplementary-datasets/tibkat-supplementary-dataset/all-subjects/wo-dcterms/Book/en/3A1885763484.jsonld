            "abstract": "Method, Methodology and Research Design in Artistic Research: Between Solid Routes and Emergent Pathways offers a rich and innovative approach to method, research design and methodology of research in and through the arts. It spans the process from initial research design, ongoing and continuous decisions that need to be made while designing and carrying out research up to the analysis and reflection on this process when finished.  Drawing on a huge body of experience, examples of renowned artist-researchers in the international field, as well as on contemporary posthumanist philosophy and methodological literature in the humanities and social sciences in particular, the conceptual core of the book is the author's Common Ground model for research design: H\u00fcbner suggests a flexible approach both for the overall research design as well as for the from-scratch design of distinct methods. This means in particular to provide space for the unknown, and for the occasional messiness of research in and through the arts; the book provides a thorough exploration of the emergent aspects and unforeseen paths that come up during a research trajectory.  Transdisciplinary in scope, this is not just a book \"about\", but \"to work with\" methodology, supporting both seasoned and early career researchers, as well as supervisors in graduate, post graduate and doctoral education contexts",

            "title": "Institutional Approaches to Electrification : The Experience of Rural Energy Agencies/Rural Energy Funds in Sub-Saharan Africa",
            "abstract": "Energy poverty is a global problem: access to energy services is crucial to meet basic household needs, deliver and access public services, and generate income. Less than 10 percent of Sub-Saharan (SSA) rural households have access to electricity, with an overall access rate below 25 percent. One of the main obstacles for SSA electrification practitioners is the difficulty in obtaining practical and timely knowledge on how to overcome economic, technical, institutional, and political barriers to electrification in their day-to-day work. Launched in 2008, the Africa Electrification Initiative (AEI) seeks to create and sustain a living body of practical knowledge and a network of SSA practitioners for the design, development, and implementation of rural, peri-urban, and urban on-grid and off-grid electrification programs. AEI supports the network by organizing workshops and promoting online discussions and knowledge exchanges on topics important for its members. The workshop set out to address a number of relevant electrification topics previously identified through in-depth discussions and ongoing knowledge exchanges among a growing network of SSA practitioners. The workshop's main focus was on ground-level implementation of different institutional approaches to electrification, with particular focus on the experiences of rural energy agencies/rural energy funds (REAs/REFs) across SSA. The workshop lasted two and a half days, comprising 21 sessions, including regular session panels and discussion clinics with a longer duration. It also featured exhibition space for posters submitted by participating institutions, an expo of approved lighting products from the lighting Africa program, and an awards ceremony to recognize the best papers submitted by SSA electrification practitioners in response to the AEI call for papers",

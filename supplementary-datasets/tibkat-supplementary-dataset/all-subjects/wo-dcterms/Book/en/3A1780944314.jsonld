            "abstract": "Close to one million people are unhoused in the United States today. Millions and millions are illhoused - people living in shanties or leaky, moldy trailers. And millions more are mishoused - in houses that are abusive in their loneliness, forlorn and empty at so many levels. We can do something about it. Actually, it's low hanging fruit, should we choose to do something; impossible, if we do not. And it's essential, not only for the wellbeing of the individual, but also for the wellbeing of the State, and the society.0Current studies are overwhelmingly show that it is more cost effective, in terms of tax dollars earmarked for city, county, state, and federal governments, to house people than it is to just leave them outside. About $20k to $40k cheaper for each person per year. In the case of the unhoused, it also taxes our psyches and our emotions to see our neighbours sleeping on the sidewalk. It is difficult, if not impossible, to explain to our children and grandchildren how we Americans leave people outside in the cold - mentally challenged or not. Then, there is the moral issue. If you are motivated to get a new homeless housing project moving in your town, this book is the best place to start",

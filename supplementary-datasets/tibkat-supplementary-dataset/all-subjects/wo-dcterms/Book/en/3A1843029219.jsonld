                "This book analyzes the transformation of Turkey\u2019s international and domestic politics in the past two decades through a comprehensive domestic- international nexus. It examines the domestic system and the main historical challenges without neglecting their international drivers and looks into main foreign policy areas and issues by accounting for the domestic developments that affected them. Looking inside Turkey\u2019s transformation on the basis of an interplay of external and internal factors, through the prism of critical scholars who all agree on the interdependency of national and international politics, it is designed to provide a thoughtful look into the future of Turkey through themes and regions. Harun Arikan is Professor of International Relations at \u00c7ukurova University, Turkey. He was a research fellow at Oxford University in the UK, and a visiting scholar at the University of Southern Maine in the USA. Zeynep Alemdar is Professor of Political Science at Istanbul Okan University, Turkey, where she currently acts as Dean of the Business and Administration Faculty and directs the Gender Studies Research Center.",

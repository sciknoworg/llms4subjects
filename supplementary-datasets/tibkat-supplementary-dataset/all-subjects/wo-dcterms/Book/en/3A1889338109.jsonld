                "This book presents a comprehensive exploration of tribology concepts and their real-world implications, delving into introductory principles as well as advanced topics such as friction, lubrication, and wear. Tailored for engineers across diverse disciplines, it serves as a fundamental resource for both undergraduate engineering courses and postgraduate studies focused on tribology. Moreover, it caters to the needs of mechanical, materials, and biomechanics researchers, engineers, academics, and industry professionals alike. Noteworthy features include unique engineering perspectives, practical discussions on lubrication principles for minimizing friction and wear, and guidance on selecting optimal lubricants and materials for various tribological applications."

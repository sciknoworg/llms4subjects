            "abstract": "Complex infrastructures such as railway networks face increasing challenges related to resource allocation, external events, constraints, and demands. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize the Asset Management (AM) phase to ensure the value and functionality of the assets. The integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can support this phase, but it can only yield benefits with a comprehensive approach that considers and addresses the specific needs and resources of the assets and their AM organization. The main benefits include improved data management, manipulation, information visualization and optimized resource allocation. This study describes an intermediate step towards developing a BIM/GIS integration framework for AM that can guide both researchers and practitioners. The framework aims to bridge theory and practice by incorporating insights from literature reviews and case studies. Its main objectives are to provide a comprehensive multi-stakeholder view and methods for effectively integrating BIM and GIS in this context. To develop the framework, the study employed focus groups, interviews, and practical BIM/GIS tests, which provided insights reported in this article. Furthermore, the study provides research directions for effective BIM/GIS integration in infrastructure AM",

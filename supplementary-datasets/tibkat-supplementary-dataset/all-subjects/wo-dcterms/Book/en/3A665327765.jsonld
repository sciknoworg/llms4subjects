            "abstract": "In this Occasional Paper the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs publishes its overview and assessments of the 2011 Economic and Fiscal Programmes (EFP) of the potential candidate countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia). In 2001 a regular economic fiscal surveillance procedure was established for the candidate countries. It aims at preparing countries for the participation in the multilateral surveillance and economic policy co-ordination procedures currently in place in the EU as part of the Economic and Monetary Union. The Pre-Accession Economic Programmes (PEPs) are part of this procedure. The PEPs have developed, since their start in 2001, into increasingly important platforms for the authorities to develop and communicate appropriate economic, fiscal and structural policies over the medium term, consistent with their EU membership aspirations. For this reason a similar, though reduced, exercise was started in 2007 with the potential candidate countries, with the submission and assessment of annual EFPs as important element. The EFPs have two objectives: first, to outline a medium-term policy framework, including public finance objectives and structural reform priorities needed for EU accession; and, second, to offer an opportunity to develop the institutional and analytical capacity necessary to participate in EMU with a derogation in regards to the adoption of the euro upon accession, particularly in the areas of multilateral surveillance and co-ordination of economic policies. The development of the institutional capacity to co-ordinate between the various ministries, government agencies and the central bank is a particularly important aspect ensuring the success of the Pre-Accession Fiscal Surveillance Procedure. Almost all countries broadly complied with the deadline of 31 January 2011 for submitting the programmes",

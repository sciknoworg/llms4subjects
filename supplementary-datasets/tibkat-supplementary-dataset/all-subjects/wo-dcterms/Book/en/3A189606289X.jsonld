                "\u201cThis landmark text provides an informed, accessible and essential guide to the politics of migration and asylum in Italy and, by doing so, highlights the tensions, ambiguities and, at times, contradictions, that characterise both Italian and wider European migration policies and politics.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Geddes, Professor of Migration Studies, European University Institute, Italy \u201cBy taking an original constructivist approach and combining qualitative and quantitative methods, the book shows how migration policy is shaped by policymakers\u2019 cognitive frames and sensemaking, profoundly innovating theoretical debates on migration governance in Europe and beyond.\u201d \u2014 Tiziana Caponio, Associate Professor, University of Turin and Collegio Carlo Alberto, Italy \u201cWhilst many contributions have been written about migration policy and politics, this book stands out. It explores a key part of the puzzle on migration and its governance largely ignored so far: interpretations of the causes and effects of migration by decision makers. In doing so it connects the dots between public attitudes and migration governance. A must read for everyone who aims to understand responses to migration not only in Italy but in Europe.\u201d \u2014 Leila Hadj Abdou, Part-Time Assistant Professor, European University Institute, Italy This book examines the various ways in which policymakers and political actors across different governmental levels have developed responses to the recent European refugee \u2018crisis\u2019, and the effects of these responses. Whereas previous studies have often focused on the discourses and policies implemented by national and local governments, this book shifts the focus to knowledge formation and decision-making processes. Drawing on evidence from Italy \u2013 a country that has been centrally affected by the refugee \u2018crisis\u2019 \u2013 the book examines policy processes regarding asylum-seeking migration at sub-national, national and EU level. It argues that policymakers at all levels of government can be influenced by perceptions of public attitudes towards immigration, and that these perceptions are often divorced from objective evidence. The book will appeal to all those interested in multilevel governance, migration studies, public policy, and European politics. Andrea Pettrachin is Researcher at the University of Turin, and Collegio Carlo Alberto, Italy."

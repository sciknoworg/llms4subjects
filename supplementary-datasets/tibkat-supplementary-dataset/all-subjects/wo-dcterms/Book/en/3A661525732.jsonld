The authors included in this book represent multiple perspectives including Christian, Jewish, Hindu, philosophical, and others. This volume will be of interest to both academics and business practitioners who promote a contemporary re-integration of business and religious values and for those concerned about the dangers inherent in this project. In the end, this volume suggests that in a pluralistic and democratic society the only justification for going back home again to traditional religious texts is to help us all move forward together. If the real reason we're invoking religion in the public sphere is to strengthen our own religious communities and our own identities as members of particular religious communities, we are making a fundamental error in judgement. The goal of a legitimate religiously grounded business ethics can and must be the desire to critique, enhance, and strengthen the democratic values and institutions of society including business. These values include noncoercion, transparency, equal rights, pluralism, compromise, individual and communal responsibility, and many others",

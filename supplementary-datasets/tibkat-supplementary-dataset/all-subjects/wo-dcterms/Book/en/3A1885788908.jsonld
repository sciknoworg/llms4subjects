            "title": "South Africa Pushed to the Limit : The political economy of change",
            "abstract": "South Africa\u2019s democratic government has worked hard at improving the lives of the black majority, yet close to half the population lives in poverty, jobs are scarce, and the country is more unequal than ever. For millions, the colour of people\u2019s skin still decides their destiny. In its wide-ranging, incisive and provocative analysis, South Africa Pushed to the Limit shows that although the legacies of apartheid and colonialism weigh heavy, many of the strategic choices made since the early 1990s have compounded those handicaps. The big winners of the transition, Marais demonstrates, have been the country\u2019s conglomerates, especially those active in the finance sector. The basic structure of Africa\u2019s biggest economy, however, remains largely intact and continues to serve a gilded minority, which now accommodates sections of the new political elite. The government, meanwhile, has squandered crucial leverage in a series of errors and miscalculations \u2013 at huge detriment to efforts to reduce poverty and inequality. The book explains why those choices were made, where they went awry, and why South Africa\u2019s vaunted formations of the left \u2013 old and new \u2013 have failed to prevent or alter them. Building on his acclaimed book Limits to Change, Marais examines South Africa\u2019s most pressing issues \u2013 from the real reasons behind President Jacob Zuma\u2019s rise and the purging of his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, and how the African National Congress replenishes its power, to piercing analyses of the country\u2019s continuing AIDS crisis, its economic path, the changes wrought in the world of work, and the unfolding struggles over belonging and identity. South Africa Pushed to the Limit presents a riveting, benchmark analysis of the incomplete journey beyond apartheid",

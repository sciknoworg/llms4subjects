            "abstract": "The Apologia respondens ad ea quae Jacobus Lopis Stunica taxauerat in primaduntaxat Noui Testamenti aeditione is Erasmus' first apology against the SpaniardStunica. Erasmus himself classed it under the eighth 'ordo' of his works, that is,the 'ordo' of his apologies; see Ep. I to Botzheim, 30 January 1523, p. 4 I, 1. 22,and cf. Ep. 2283 to Boece, 15 March 1530, 1. 189. Since the editors of BASreserved the seventh 'ordo' ('tomus' in their terminology) for the Paraphrasis inNouum Testamentum, in accordance with Erasmus' direction in the letter toBotzheim (Ep. I, p. 41, 1. 8), and the next 'ordo' for the translations from theChurch Fathers, in accordance with the letter to Boece (Ep. 2283, 1. 155), thecollected apologies eventually became the ninth 'ordo', not the eighth. In thepresent edition, the ~rst apology against Stunica is the second volume of theninth 'ordo'. Four further apologies against Stunica and that against Carranzawill form, or form part of, another volume.Interestingly enough, the first apology against Stunica is the first work ofErasmus whose final authentic redaction turns out not to be contained in anedition printed during Erasmus' lifetime, but in BAS. This remarkable fact aswell as its consequences for the pres~nt edition will be discussed in detail in theIntroduction, chapter VI.In addition to those who, at the request of the editorial board, took chargeof the supervision of this volume and whose names are recorded on the versoof the title-page, M. de Jonge of Leiden has kindly read and criticized thetypescript.The editorial board and the editor of the present volume thank all librarieswho put books, photostats, microfilms and bibliographical material at theirdisposal. They would also like to thank Mrs Anna de Haas of the NorthHollandPublishing Company for the valuable assistance she has rendered inseeing this volume through the press",

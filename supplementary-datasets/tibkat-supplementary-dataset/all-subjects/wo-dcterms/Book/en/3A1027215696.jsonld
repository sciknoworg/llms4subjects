                "\"'Autism from the Inside Out' is the first book to focus on providing Irish parents, early years practitioners and primary, post-primary and special school teachers with effective strategies for supporting children with autism spectrum difference at home and in education settings. Presenting contributions from a range of national and international experts in education and psychology, the volume emerged from a national evaluation of education provision commissioned by the National Council for Special Education, which clearly identified a need for additional guidance, advice and support for parents and teachers. The book rejects 'disorder' in favour of 'difference', emphasising the importance of a child-centred approach and the dangers of overgeneralising. It includes chapters on effective teaching strategies to promote learning; responding to children's strengths and needs through individualised planning; assessment practices; the role of the special needs assistant; managing transitions; the environment as the third teacher; promoting children's well-being; and effective leadership for inclusion.\"--"

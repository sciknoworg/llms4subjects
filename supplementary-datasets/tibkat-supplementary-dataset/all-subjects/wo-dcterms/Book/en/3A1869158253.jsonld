            "abstract": "In 1884, an article entitled \u2018Hospital Nurses\u2019, describing the role and responsibilities of nursing staff in hospital wards, appeared in the Leisure Hour. The author, who signed herself simply \u2018M. E. H.\u2019, was Margaret Elise Harkness, who, a few years later, would publish a series of novels on the conditions of the urban working poor under the pseudonym \u2018John Law\u2019. Harkness had been working as a professional writer, mainly for the periodical press, since 1881; prior to this she had spent several years training and working as a nurse and dispenser in various London hospitals. \u2018Hospital Nurses\u2019 describes nursing as a profession, stating: \u2018Let no one imagine that this is work which all women can do.\u2019 Nurses, Harkness explains, are marked out by their abilities, not their social class, as the work relies on cooperation and equal interaction between nurses of different class backgrounds. Although she gave up professional nursing, the voices of nurses and other medical practitioners are heard throughout Harkness\u2019s long writing career. Nurses appear as characters and commentators in her work; but she also continued to invoke her own medical knowledge for decades after she abandoned her training. For instance, she used periodicals as platforms to give medical advice on epidemics she witnessed in Australian mining communities around the turn of the twentieth century. This chapter traces the voices of nurses as female professionals through Harkness\u2019s contributions to periodicals from the 1880s to the beginning of the twentieth century",

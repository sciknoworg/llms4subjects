            "abstract": "Concrete is one if the most used building materials worldwide. With up to 80% of volume, a large constituent of concrete consists of fine and coarse aggregate particles (normally, sizes of 0.1mm to 32 mm) which are dispersed in a cement paste matrix. The size distribution of the aggregates (i.e. the grading curve) substantially affects the properties and quality characteristics of concrete, such as e.g. its workability at the fresh state and the mechanical properties at the hardened state. In practice, usually the size distribution of small samples of the aggregate is determined by manual mechanical sieving and is considered as representative for a large amount of aggregate. However, the size distribution of the actual aggregate used for individual production batches of concrete varies, especially when e.g. recycled material is used as aggregate. As a consequence, the unknown variations of the particle size distribution have a negative effect on the robustness and the quality of the final concrete produced from the raw material. Towards the goal of deriving precise knowledge about the actual particle size distribution of the aggregate, thus eliminating the unknown variations in the material\u2019s properties, we propose a data set for the image based prediction of the size distribution of concrete aggregates. Incorporating such an approach into the production chain of concrete enables to react on detected variations in the size distribution of the aggregate in real-time by adapting the composition, i.e. the mixture design of the concrete accordingly, so that the desired concrete properties are reached.",

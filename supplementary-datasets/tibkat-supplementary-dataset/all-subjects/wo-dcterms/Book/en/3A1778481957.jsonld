            "abstract": "Across his cinema, the US, Mormon director Jared Hess has represented the Mexican Other in ambiguous ways that affirm the humanity of the US\u2019s southern neighbors while at the same time signaling them as irreconcilably different from\u2014and perhaps simpler than\u2014their North American counterparts. This holds especially true in Napoleon Dynamite (2004) and Nacho Libre (United States 2006), his two most commercially successful films. The Mexican protagonists of both movies win the audience\u2019s affection in part by playing to stereotypes that rigidly separate them from US culture at large. Mexico\u2019s oversized role in Hess\u2019s aesthetic is obvious even to the casual viewer; however, few critics have attempted to reconcile the director\u2019s combination of paternalism and solidarity with people from south of the US border. In this article, I argue that Hess\u2019s ambiguous representation of Mexican peoples and cultures reflects a type of \u201cbenevolent racism\u201d that is common within white, North American Mormon communities who paradoxically view people of Mexican descent both as Others and as the physical and spiritual heirs of the peoples of the Book of Mormon",

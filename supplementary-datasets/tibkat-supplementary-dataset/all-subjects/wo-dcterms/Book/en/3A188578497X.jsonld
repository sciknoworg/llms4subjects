Pacheco reminds us that \u201ccurriculum study is a normative question,\u201d now necessarily \u201cwith its technological dimension.\u201d Then in a stunningly synoptic sentence that students could usefully study all semester, he summarizes: \u201cthe curriculum as a socially, culturally, ideologically, politically and economically constructed practice, is a formal and informal dispositive of interwoven relationships between knowledge, power, and technology.\u201d (\u2026) Penetrated, we become impregnated with the structures of software, as Pacheco appreciates: \u201cTechnological devices are powerful instruments of subjectivity production, moving the subject into predefined ways of knowing (\u2026) Old-fashioned rhetoric alright, but insightfully implying we need to return to the past, when were still \u2013 sort of \u2013 human, before we were seduced by supranational \u201ccitizenship\u201d in the software state, before we became submerged in the \u201ccurriculum of everything.\u201d Step back from the brink.

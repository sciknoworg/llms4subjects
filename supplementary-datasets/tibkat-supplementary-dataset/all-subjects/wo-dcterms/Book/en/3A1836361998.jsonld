            "abstract": "To summarise our findings, the Hippocratic Epidemics case reports is an example of a text whose intended audiences, despite the ambiguities and historical uncertainties about the texts\u2019 composition and transmission, were very firmly delimited as professional and medical. Such closure defines this phase of ancient medicine as particularly territorial and \u201ctechnical\u201d, on the one hand \u2013 no literary pretence, nor broader intellectual appeal of the kind shown by Galen is on the horizon of these writers, nor any explicit attempt to win over lay audiences, at least in the Epidemics.77 Also, it tells us something about the epistemology and didactics at work in the Hippocratic handling of patients, which we can summarise as follows: non-theoretical, observation-based and data-centred; self-standing, i.e. not relying on a system of knowledge or a \u201csyllabus\u201d (compare Galen\u2019s frequent recommendation on which of his books one should read first, which are for beginners, what should follow, etc.), but needing to \u201csupport itself\u201d by insuring the memorisation of the repertoires of observations, procedures, risks and mistakes; lack of a synthesis of the empirical data, such as a form of diagnosis, or of the \u201cepistemological extension\u201d that might turn the observed case into an \u201cexperiment\u201d.78 The Hippocratic use of individual evidence \u2013 the patient case \u2013 remained in this early stage a communication of pure data. Individual memory, in conclusion, the reception of an individual intellect \u2013 a future student, a training doctor \u2013 characterises the audience of these texts, motivates and even determines, concretely, their very existence",

                "This edited volume presents a broad range of original practice-oriented research studies about tertiary mathematics education. These are based on current theoretical frameworks and on established and innovative empirical research methods. It provides a relevant overview of current research, along with being a valuable resource for researchers in tertiary mathematics education, including novices in the field. Its practice orientation research makes it attractive to university mathematics teachers interested in getting access to current ideas and results, including theory-based and empirically evaluated teaching and learning innovations. The content of the book is spread over 5 sections: The secondary-tertiary transition; University students' mathematical practices and mathematical inquiry; Research on teaching and curriculum design; University students\u2019 mathematical inquiry and Mathematics for non-specialists.",

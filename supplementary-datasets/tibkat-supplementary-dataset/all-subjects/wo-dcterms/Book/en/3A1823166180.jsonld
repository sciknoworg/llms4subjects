                "Learn how to automate processes, visualize your data, and improve productivity using Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, SharePoint, Forms, Teams, and more. This book will help you build complete solutions that often involve storing data in SharePoint, creating a front-end application in Power Apps or Forms, adding additional functionality with Power Automate, and effective reports and dashboards in Power BI. This new edition greatly expands the focus on Power Apps, Power BI, Power Automate, and Teams, along with SharePoint and Microsoft Forms. It starts with the basics of programming and shows how to build a simple email application in .NET, HTML/JavaScript, Power Apps on its own, and Power Apps and Power Automate in combination. It then covers how to connect Power Apps to SharePoint, create an approval process in Power Automate, visualize surveys in Power BI, and create your own survey solution with the combination of a number of Microsoft 365 tools. You\u2019ll work with an extended example that shows how to use Power Apps and SharePoint together to create your own help ticketing system. This book offers a deep dive into Power BI, including working with JSON, XML, and Yes/No data, as well as visualizing learning data and using it to detect inconsistencies between Excel files. You\u2019ll also see how to connect to Remedy and to the help system you will have created. Under author Jeffrey Rhodes\u2019s guidance, you\u2019ll delve into the Power Apps collection to learn how to avoid dreaded \"delegation\" issues with larger data sets. Back on applications, you will create a training class sign-up solution to only allow users to choose classes with available seats. Digging deeper into Teams, you\u2019ll learn how to send chats, posts, and \"adaptive cards\" from Power Automate. Rounding things out, you\u2019ll save Forms attachments to SharePoint with Power Automate, create your own \"Employee Recognition\" app with all of the Power Platform and Teams, add or edit weekly status reports, and learn how to create reservation and scoring applications. After reading the book, you will be able to build powerful applications using Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, SharePoint, Forms, and Teams. You will: Create productivity-enhancing applications with Power Apps, Power Automate, SharePoint, Forms, and/or Teams Transform and visualize data with Power BI to include custom columns, measures, and pivots Avoid delegation issues and tackle complicated Power Apps issues like complex columns, filtering, and ForAll loops Build scheduled or triggered Power Automate flows to schedule Teams Meetings, send emails, launch approvals, and much more.",

                "Everyone deserves to use the Internet. An estimated 1.3 billion people experience significant disability. That\u2019s 16percent of the world\u2019s population, or one in six of us. At the same time, over 96 percent of the one million most popular websites have an accessibility issue. Add to this the massive rise in legal cases around sites not being accessible, including Beyonc\u00e9, Disney, and Netflix, and you have an important topic that more and more people are starting to engage with. In this updated and revamped second edition of the Amazon technology chart-topping Practical Web Accessibility, you\u2019ll be guided through a broad range of disabilities and access needs. You\u2019ll understand the ways these users typically engage with the web, the barriers they often face, and practical advice on how your websites and content can be compliant, but more than that, inclusive and enjoyable to use. There\u2019s also a new chapter on \u201cOutsourcing Accessibility,\u201d exploring third party \u201cbolt-on\u201d tools, \u201cbuild your own website\u201d platforms like Wix, and popular design systems. You\u2018ll explore whether they\u2019re helpful or detrimental in the fight to make the web more accessible. Throughout this book you\u2019ll learn to test for, spot, and fix web accessibility issues for a wide range of physical and mental impairments. Featuring content from the latest compliance frameworks, including the newly released WCAG 2.2 and exploratory concepts in WCAG 3, you\u2019ll see how to go beyond the basic requirements in order to help your users. You\u2019ll also learn that an accessible approach won\u2019t just help people with disabilities, it will improve your website for everyone. This book comes complete with practical examples you can use in your own sites, along with a brand-new approach to auditing and improving a website\u2019s accessibility, and a team\u2019s approach to it, based on tools created by the author and refined over years as a consultant \u2014 The FAIR framework and ACCESS checklist. With these tools, you can set up processes for yourself and your team that will drastically improve the accessibility of your sites and, importantly, keep them that way in the future. Suitable for those of any profession or experience level, Practical Web Accessibility gives you all the information you need to ensure that your sites are truly accessible for the modern, inclusive web. If you would like to learn about web accessibility in a clear and actionable way, this book is for you.",

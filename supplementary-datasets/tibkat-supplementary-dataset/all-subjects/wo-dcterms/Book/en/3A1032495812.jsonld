                "\"This book is devoted to the computer modeling of two-dimensional materials consisting of no more than two sheets of graphene or silicene. The results of the investigation of the mechanical and thermal properties of such ultrathin films that are in a free-standing state and, also, located on substrates of silver, copper, and graphite are presented. The thermal stability of copper, nickel, and aluminum films of monatomic thickness on graphene has been studied. The calculated data on the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of single-layer graphene and silicene are presented. The excellent adsorption properties of graphene allow one to use it as a filter. A method for purifying graphene from heavy metals (copper, lead, and mercury) is proposed and implemented in a computer experiment by bombarding a contaminated graphene film on a copper substrate by clusters of noble gases with energies from 5 to 30 eV at various angles of incidence. This method of purifying graphene from mercury is compared with the method of heating this toxic metal deposited on graphene. The book is aimed at creating new composite materials with the use of graphene and silicene. Considerable attention is paid to the creation of high-capacity, rapidly cyclic, long-lived anodes of ionic batteries. Graphene and silicene can be used as anode materials of lithium-ion batteries, while their charge capacity sharply increase and the charging time is shortened. Here, the authors describe the results of the passage of lithium ions through graphene and silicene membranes.This book describes computer experiments involving the passage by lithium ions through the graphene, silicene, and silicene-graphene channels formed by corresponding perfect sheets and sheets containing vacancy defects\"--",

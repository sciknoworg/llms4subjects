            "abstract": "Approaches to world literature often think through binaries of local/global, major/minor, provincial/cosmopolitan, taking them as given positions on a single world map. To an extent, this is true of Amitav Ghosh\u2019s prize-winning essay \u201cThe testimony of my grandfather\u2019s bookcase\u201d (1998), which reflects on his grandfather\u2019s collection of world literature books to think about the relationship between his grandfather\u2019s provincial location in Calcutta and the world. Yet in The Shadow Lines Ghosh takes a much more complex and interesting approach to space, the world, perception and narration. In the novel\u2019s complex narration, space, time, and self always appeared mirrored through other people, times, and spaces. Places also acquire reality and meaning only after they are first narrated and imagined, often several times, and before they are experienced directly. This is a stance that has deep existential but also epistemological implications that go beyond \u201csimply\u201d critiquing colonial and national border-making. This essay explores how (and which) spaces become \u201csignificant\u201d in the novel, and how the novel\u2019s approach to space can be productive for thinking about world literature",

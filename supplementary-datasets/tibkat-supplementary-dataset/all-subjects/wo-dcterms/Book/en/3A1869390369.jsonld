            "title": "Problems and solutions in thermal engineering : with multiple-choice type questions",
            "abstract": "This book is a collection of over 225 multiple choice type questions (MCQs) and more than 40 practice/exam questions with solutions. This book complements a 2-volume textbook set titled Thermal Engineering by the same author. The answers are adequately supported by well-illustrated diagrams wherever necessary for better understanding of the concepts. The book also included steam tables as an appendix to aid in problem solving .This book proves useful for undergraduate students of mechanical engineering and related disciplines. The book is used in conjunction with the author's textbook set on thermal engineering or as a supplement to other core textbooks and lecture materials. It is used to support classroom teaching or as a self-study guide. The problem-solution format also proves useful for students and professionals involved in exam prep for graduate university entrance tests and professional certifications. .",

            "abstract": "This publication is a resource book for Social Workers engaging in the \ufb01eld of migration. It aims to, on the one hand, display facts about the living realities on the ground migrants and Social Workers active in the \ufb01eld are facing, circumstances presented by experienced practitioners and researchers of this \ufb01eld. On the other hand, it presents methods and approaches, extracting them from these experiences and re\ufb02ections insights, relevant for Social Work and consequently, also signi\ufb01cant for Social Work educational practice. The new challenges of the 21st century ask Social Work education for a change, adapting curricula towards more experienced based teaching practices, intercultural, participatory learning sites and exchange, and future oriented personal empowerment and resilience training. International Social Work could take on a transformational leading role, as our global security and well-being of tomorrow depends on the educational foundations laid down today",

                "This book celebrates the life and work of the late Giovanni Morchio (1948\u20132021). It features scientific and anecdotal contributions written by his former colleagues, co-authors, and students, as well as senior scientists who were active witnesses to the dramatic advances in physics and in mathematics that took place during his 50-year-long career. The volume begins with a biographical introduction, detailing Giovanni Morchio\u2019s life and his role as a physicist, mathematician, teacher, and scientist. The core of the book covers a vast spectrum of ideas, reflecting Dr Morchio\u2019s scientific interests. Each chapter develops a specific topic of modern research, ranging from quantum mechanics and quantum field theory to additional themes such as the connection between general relativity and Newtonian gravitation. Every contribution provides a historical retrospective, a survey of advances, an outlook of future perspectives and challenges, and an updated bibliography. The last part collects the authors\u2019 recollections of their professional and personal interactions with Dr Morchio, in recognition of his deep achievements, his exceptional pedagogical qualities, and his praiseworthy social and pro bono commitment. Authored by physicists of international calibre covering a broad range of subjects, the book will be a valuable reference for researchers and students of theoretical and mathematical physics.",

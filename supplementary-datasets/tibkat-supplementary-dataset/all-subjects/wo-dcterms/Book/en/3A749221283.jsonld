            "abstract": "The range of applications in the area of motion analysis and image sequence processing is expanding with the steady increase in the use of video and television systems in a variety of different fields. A consequence of this expansion is the increased interest in research in this area. Motion Analysis and Image Sequence Processing brings together the fundamentals of various aspects of image sequence processing, as well as the most recent developments and applications. An image sequence is a series of two-dimensional images that are sequentially ordered in time. The analysis of image motion, and processing of image sequences using the motion information is becoming more and more important as video and television systems are finding an increasing number of applications in the areas of entertainment, robot vision, education, personal communications, multimedia, and scientific research. The importance of motion analysis and image sequence processing is due to two major factors. First, the information that needs to be obtained from the sequence may be inherently time-dependent. In that case, spatial information that can be obtained from a single image frame may not bear any useful information, and hence one must utilize temporal information by considering a sequence of images. Second, in some applications it may be advantageous to consider the processing of a sequence of images instead of individual images. This is because one can utilize the naturally existing temporal relationship among the frames of an image sequence to obtain results that are superior to those obtained by frame-by-frame processing of the sequence. Motion Analysis and Image Sequence Processing contains a coherent and rigorous discussion of recent fundamental developments, as well as applications of motion estimation and image sequence processing. Motion Analysis and Image Sequence Processing is a useful reference for engineers, industrial and academic research scientists, graduate students and faculty who are either already active in research in the field or planning to pursue research in one or more aspects of image sequence processing. This book can be used as the textbook in an advanced level course and as a reference.

            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, The importance of nanotechnology related research and development has become recognised worldwide. Substantial public and private investment is now being ploughed into research and development in a number of industrial sectors, where nanotechnology has become established and has led to new commercial products. The construction industry, having major economic significance with nano-scale research and development which is only emerging, offers a wide scope for exploitation of nanotechnology. With international contributions from experts in the field, Nanotechnology in Construction amalgamates previously fragmented research and emerging trends. It reflects the inherent multi-disciplinary nature of nano-scale research in construction and contributions cover a wide spectrum, from highly scientific investigations to futuristic applications.  The book is organised into four broad sections, the first reviews and analyses the prospects of exploitation of nanotechnology in construction, the second discusses novel tools and their capabilities, the final two sections show existing significant products where nanotechnology has been already been exploited or where product development is under-way. Nanotechnology in Construction will appeal to researchers already working in this field as well as those wishing to enter it. It will also inform governmental and other funding agencies of the most promising future directions and their related timescales. Practical applications are considered and explanations of the underlying basics are given, raising awareness and understanding of what nanotechnology can offer to construction professionals in general",

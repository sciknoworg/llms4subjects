            "title": "Defect Interaction and Clustering in Semiconductors",
            "abstract": "Modern semiconductor devices rely upon precise defect engineering. On the one hand: defects are the components needed to generate the electronic architecture of the device. On the other hand: they may \u2013 if not carefully controlled\u2013 induce failure of that device. During the past fifty years, the electrical and optical properties of defects, their generation, transport, clustering and reactions between them have been investigated intensively. Yet the development of semiconductor technology remains closely connected to the advances made in defect science and engineering. Compared to metals, defect control in silicon is significantly complicated by the open structure of its lattice. As a result, reactions between defects, even at room temperature, have become a central issue in defect engineering. The aim of this book is to take into detailed consideration a few selected topics concerning the chemical, structural, electrical and mechanical consequences of the interaction of atomic defects and impurities with extended defects, the clustering of defects and impurities in semiconductors, and the interaction of small molecules on the silicon surface; the latter being chosen as examples of a type of interaction in which the chemistry of the interaction plays the major role.Written by experts who have made major contributions to the field, the chapters introduce each subject at textbook level and then develop it right up to its present-day level of understanding",

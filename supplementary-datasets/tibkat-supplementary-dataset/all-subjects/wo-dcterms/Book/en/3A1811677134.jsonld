                "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) consist of software-controlled computing devices communicating with each other and interacting with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Typical examples are a water treatment plant, an unmanned aerial vehicle, and a heart pacemaker. Because most of the functionality is implemented in software, the software is of crucial importance for the safety and security of the CPS. As software engineering becomes disciplined and mature, generally accepted principles have emerged. This book advocates principle-based engineering for the development and operation of dependable software. A total of 62 principles are introduced and cataloged into five categories: Business & organization, general principles, safety, security, and risk management principles. The principles are rigorous, teachable, and enforceable. The terminology used is precisely defined. The material is supported by numerous examples and enriched by illustrative quotes from celebrities in the field. The material addresses organizations that want to improve their methodologies to build safe and secure software for mission-critical cyber-physical systems and is suitable for a two-semester, advanced computer science lecture at a Technical University. The book Presents a successful strategy for the management of vulnerabilities, threats, and failures in mission-critical cyber-physical systems Offers deep practical insight into principle-based software development Provides direct guidance on architecting dependable cyber-physical systems for software managers and architects The Author Prof. Dr. Frank J. Furrer is a longstanding consultant for very large information systems, author or co-author of 6 books, and a computer science teacher at the Technical University of Dresden, Germany.",

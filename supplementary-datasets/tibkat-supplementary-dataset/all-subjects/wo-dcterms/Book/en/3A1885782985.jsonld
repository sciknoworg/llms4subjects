            "abstract": "Write your program! is an introduction to programming. The book is based on the practical experience of basic computer science courses at universities and the training of professional developers. The approach of the book differs radically from other introductions to programming and consistently relies on didactically proven and comprehensible methods. The authors have continuously improved the selection of material and presentation over many years. The material has also benefited from the fact that it has been used in numerous courses in T\u00fcbingen and elsewhere and the feedback from these courses has been incorporated into improvements. It also forms the basis for almost all Active Group GmbH training courses on the subject of \"Functional Programming\"",

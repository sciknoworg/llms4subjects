            "abstract": "Guinea's ITC sector, the pilot project for the establishment of a national digital identification system must be more clearly defined; clarification is required regarding the status of the project signed at the end of March 2015, for the establishment of a civil registry and the production of National Identity Cards. Notwithstanding the solution chosen by the Guinean authorities, the terms of reference must be drafted in such a way as to ensure that: the needs of all sectors are duly taken into account; the right of all to civil registration is respected; resources already invested are re-utilized; the system to be put in place is perfectly well organized and in conformity with an existing legal framework, or one to be defined; the system will be interoperable; the system is sustainable.a comprehensive assessmentof eID initiatives, in order to avoid launching an eID project in an uncoordinated manner. Therefore, the National Digital Identification Register, herein after referred to as the Project, must constitute the backbone of allservices to citizens and be a flagship project in the area of civil registration. The most difficult phase of the Project is the initial development of the register, which must be constituted while ensuring that the rights of all citizens are respected. This may only be achieved if there is full transparency at all stages of the process and if all citizens understand the issues involved. As part of the preliminary study on the implementation of a national digital identification system, we have conducted an analysis of the current situation, gathering information on systems already in place or in the process of implementation, as well as the needs of the various Ministries. This report should serve as the basis for recommendations to be made for the implementation of a national digital identification system. This document is intended for all stakeholders who have participated in this study. It could be used in the event of arbitration by the Guinean authorities in relation to the development and implementation of the Project",

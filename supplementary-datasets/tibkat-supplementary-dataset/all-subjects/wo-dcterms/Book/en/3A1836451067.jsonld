            "abstract": "Learn how to accelerate C++ programs using data parallelism. This open access book enables C++ programmers to be at the forefront of this exciting and important new development that is helping to push computing to new levels. It is full of practical advice, detailed explanations, and code examples to illustrate key topics. Data parallelism in C++ enables access to parallel resources in a modern heterogeneous system, freeing you from being locked into any particular computing device. Now a single C++ application can use any combination of devices\u2014including GPUs, CPUs, FPGAs and AI ASICs\u2014that are suitable to the problems at hand. This book begins by introducing data parallelism and foundational topics for effective use of the SYCL standard from the Khronos Group and Data Parallel C++ (DPC++), the open source compiler used in this book. Later chapters cover advanced topics including error handling, hardware-specific programming, communication and synchronization, and memory model considerations. Data Parallel C++ provides you with everything needed to use SYCL for programming heterogeneous systems. What You'll Learn Accelerate C++ programs using data-parallel programming Target multiple device types (e.g. CPU, GPU, FPGA) Use SYCL and SYCL compilers Connect with computing\u2019s heterogeneous future via Intel\u2019s oneAPI initiative Who This Book Is For Those new data-parallel programming and computer programmers interested in data-parallel programming using C++",

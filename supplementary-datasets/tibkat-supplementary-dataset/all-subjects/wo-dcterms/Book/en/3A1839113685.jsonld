                "Urgent deadlines, constant lack of time, permanent delays - these are the most faithful companions and, at the same time, the greatest enemies of the project manager. Even certified project managers, people with enormous knowledge and a lot of experience, find themselves in a situation where they need great mental resilience in order not to give up. The book is a complete manual for all critical situations a project manager might need to handle along the project\u2019s lifecycle. Written by a project manager with many years of experience, each chapter contains real-life examples with analysis and guidelines. You\u2019ll benefit from the down-to-earth knowledge that usually project managers learn over the course of years in critical and stressful situations with no preparation beforehand. It\u2019s not about academic methodologies \u2013 it\u2019s about pragmatic solutions that work in real-life. Far too often, the wise theory of IT project management has nothing to do with reality. Managing IT Projects is your special compendium of knowledge, featuring \"project management black magic,\u201d chock full of proven recipes for project managers and IT organization managers, as well as advice on how to act in critical situations. You will: Examine the main reasons for delays in projects and see where they come from Review the key success factors in managing projects beyond project management methodologies and techniques Understand the critical moments of projects and see how to prepare for them Apply a pragmatic strategy and philosophy for successful project delivery and cooperation with customers."

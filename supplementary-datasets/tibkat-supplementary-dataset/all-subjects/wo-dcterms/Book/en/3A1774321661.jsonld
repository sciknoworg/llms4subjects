            "title": "2017 Vietnam Post-Typhoon Damrey Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment",
            "abstract": "Vietnam is one of the most hazard-prone countries in the East Asia and Pacific region. In recent years, Vietnam has experienced an upsurge in intensity of these natural disasters. Khanh Hoa province has suffered the most, accounting for approximately 69 percent of the total economic losses of Typhoon Damrey's impact. The sectors covered under this rapid assessment are housing, agriculture, irrigation and flood control, and transportation. However, agricultural losses were assessed for crop, livestock and fishery and production forest, only. Cross-sectoral issues such as disaster risk management (DRM), climate change (CC) and gender were also included in the rapid assessment, in addition to macro-economic impact in Khanh Hoa province. The central and provincial governments and the affected communities have been proactive in emergency response. Warnings and operational directives that were disseminated publicly via the media (TV and radio) were successful in guiding the preparedness and response efforts. As of March 2018, Khanh Hoa province has mobilized a billion to support the emergency repair of key public infrastructures and of houses, for flood prevention, and for the restoration of livelihoods of the affected communities. The joint United Nation (UN) approach provided humanitarian aid through the distribution of cash grants and vouchers, technical equipment and non-food items in the sectors of food security and the restoration of livelihoods, shelter, and water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) to more than 150,000 affected people, a substantive amount of which were beneficiaries in Khanh Hoa",

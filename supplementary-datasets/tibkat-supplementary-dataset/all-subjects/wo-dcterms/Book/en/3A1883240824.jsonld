            "abstract": "\"This book includes concepts, methodologies, and techniques used in soil nutrients and irrigation water management with regional and global prospects. This book accommodates up-to-date approaches to agricultural technologies along with future directions and compiles a wide range of articles ranging from soil moisture flow, nutrient dynamics, crop water estimation techniques, approaches to improve crop water productivity and soil health, crop simulation modelling, and remote sensing/GIS applications. The book also includes chapters on climate-resilient agriculture, advances in big data and machine-learning techniques, IoT, plasma technology, seed priming, and precision farming techniques and their environmental/economic impacts. Features: Discusses applications sustainable technologies for soil nutrients and irrigation water management at multi-scale. Covers application of remote sensing/GIS, big data and machine learning, IoT, plasma technology, seed priming, and precision farming techniques for nutrients and water management. Reviews concepts and methodologies and techniques being used in soil nutrients and irrigation water management. Provides up-to-date information as well as future directions in the field of nutrients and agricultural water management. This book is aimed at researchers and graduate students in agriculture, water resources, environment, and irrigation engineering\"--Provided by publisher",

                "This book offers a cutting-edge perspective of design for space to increase astronauts\u2019 wellbeing and performance creating a more sustainable and inclusive environment, but without to forget beauty. The relevant aspect is that these design principles are now also supported and promoted by the European Community with the New European Bauhaus project. It is legitimate to affirm that Space Design is a precursor and inspiring these principles. Space exploration has shown us how results of space research inspire management policies addressing important earth issues such as the responsible use of resources as well as ethical behavior leading to sustainable and inclusive choices. The International Space Station (ISS) is the most successful virtuous example of circular economy and sustainability by almost totally recycling the waste produced. Recently the European Space Agency (ESA) launched the first call for \u201cparastronauts\u201d opening the fly possibilities to people with physical disabilities and thus affirming the principle of inclusion in space. Thanks to design\u2014a bridge between science, technology, and beauty\u2014space opens up to new creative experiments, placing the human being at the center of the interplanetary exploration programs to ensure extra-terrestrial habitats safer, more comfortable, and efficient, where crew will feel \u201clike at home\u201d. .",

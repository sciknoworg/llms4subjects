            "title": "Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering",
            "abstract": "Few events in science have captured the same level of sustained interest and imagination of the nonscientific community as Stem Cells, Tissue Engineering, and Regenerative Medicine. The fundamental concept of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine is appealing to scientists, physicians, and lay people alike: to heal tissue or organ defects that the current medical practice deems difficult or impossible to cure. Tissue engineering combines cells, engineering, and materials methods with suitable biochemical and physiochemical factors to improve or replace biologic functions. Regenerative medicine is a new branch of medicine that attempts to change the course of chronic disease, in many instances regenerating failing organ systems lost due to age, disease, damage, or congenital defects. The area is rapidly becoming one of the most promising treatment options for patients suffering from tissue failure. This book of Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering fairly reflects the state of the art of these two disciplines at this time as well as their therapeutic application. It covers numerous topics, such as stem cells, cell culture, polymer synthesis, novel biomaterials, drug delivery, therapeutics, and the creation of tissues and organs. The goal is to have this book serve as a reference for graduate students, post-docs, teachers, scientists and physicians, and as an explanatory analysis for executives in biotech and pharmaceutical companies",

                "Introduction / Alexander J. Field -- Made in Germany : the German currency crisis of July 1931 / Thomas Ferguson, Peter Temin -- Can incomes policies reduce real wages? : micro-evidence from the 1931 Australian award wage cut / Andrew J. Seltzer -- Decaying at the core : urban decline in Cleveland, 1915-1980 / Fred H. Smith -- Wage-stickiness, monetary changes, and real incomes in late-medieval England and the Low Countries 1300-1500 : did money matter? / John H. Munro -- What protected peasants best? : markets, risk, efficiency, and medieval English agriculture / Gary Richardson -- The Hesse-Cassel emigrants : a new sample of transatlantic emigrants linked to their origins / Simone A. Wegge -- The household balance sheet, credit, and uncertainty at the onset of the great depression in the USA / David Greasley, Jakob B. Madsen -- Coping with financial catastrophe : the San Francisco clearinghouse during the earthquake of 1906 / Ronnie J. Phillips. - Volume 21 of Research in Economic History is a substantial contribution in several respects. Its heft reflects the continuing increase in quality submissions to this series, which invites (although it does not require) authors to take advantage of less stringent space limitations than is typically true in a journal article. The papers offer regional diversity: two papers with principal focus on England, one on Germany, one on Australia, and three on the United States. There are some commonalities in themes: we have three papers on 1931, three papers that have something to do with banks, two on urban economic history, and two on wage stickiness, albeit in different countries and addressing labor markets several centuries apart. What can be said of all of these inquiries, however, is that each involves the careful consideration of quantitative and qualitative data within a well articulated theoretical framework. And in almost every case, we have original analysis of primary source material. It's a pleasure in this volume to publish work of scholars at all stages of their careers. We have contributions ranging from those of recently minted Ph.Ds to those of distinguished senior scholars. Each of these articles is written with care, polish, and often passion. Academic disciplines flourish - and economic history is no exception - when scholars immerse themselves in their subjects and combine this with commitments to logic and evidence, detail, and clarity of exposition. The consequences are the fascinating papers and great scholarship evident here. We look forward to continuing to publish innovative, well written and carefully considered contributions to economic history, providing a niche which complements outlets such as the Journal of Economic History, Explorations in Economic History, and the Economic History Review. Potential contributors are urged to contact the editor for information on submission requirements",

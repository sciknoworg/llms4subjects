            "title": "Neuroblastoma : Present and Future",
            "abstract": "Neuroblastoma, once called \"enigmatic\", due to \"unpredictable\" clinical behaviors, is composed of biologically diverse tumors. Molecular/genomic properties unique to the individual tumors closely link to the clinical outcomes of patients. Establishing risk stratification models after analyzing biologic characteristics of each case has made a great success in patient management. However, the trend of improving survival rates in neuroblastoma over the last 30 years has started to level off, and currently available treatment modalities have almost reached to their maximized intensity. Furthermore, aggressive treatment causes significant long-term morbidities to the survivors. We really need to make the next step to the level of personalized medicine with more precise understanding of neuroblastoma biology. This book includes useful data and insights from the world's experts in this field. I believe this book can make an excellent contribution to all the investigators working hard and fighting for the children stricken by this disease",

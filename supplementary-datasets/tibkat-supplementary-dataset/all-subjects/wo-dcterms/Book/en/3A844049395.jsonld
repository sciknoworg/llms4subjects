            "abstract": "Entrepreneurship& Small Business examines the life cycle of firms tracing development from initial start-up, through to growth and maturity. It studies entrepreneurs - what motivates them, how they manage and lead, and how certain defining characteristics they possess can help shape the businesses they run, and the wider environment of entrepreneurship to include family business, and social, civic, philanthropic and corporate enterprises.  The book expertly synthesises research foundations and academic studies with real-life practical knowledge and examples. Richly resourced with insights from a wide range of international entrepreneurs and industries, while remaining grounded in academic theory, the text fosters entrepreneurial talent, thinking and skills. Case studies, practice insights, video interviews and discussion scenarios are used to practically demonstrate how concepts are implemented in successful small and growing companies. Clearly structured and accessibly presented throughout, the vitality and expertise of the author make this an engaging and informative read.  Burns' text is ideal for undergraduates, MBA students, and students taking specialist postgraduate modules on Entrepreneurship, Enterprise, Small Business Management and New Venture Creation within business and management courses.",

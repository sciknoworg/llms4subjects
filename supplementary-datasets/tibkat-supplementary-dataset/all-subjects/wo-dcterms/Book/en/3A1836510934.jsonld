            "abstract": "Since Roy Porter\u2019s pioneering work on the \u2018patient\u2019s view\u2019, historians have taken up the challenge to rewrite medicine\u2019s past \u2018from below\u2019. However, this chapter argues that they have not been radical enough and have neglected a key part of Porter\u2019s agenda for the new social history of medicine. He wrote: \u2018We should stop seeing the doctor as the agent of primary care. People took care before they took physick. What we habitually call primary care is in fact secondary care, once the sufferer has become a patient, [and] has entered the medical arena.\u2019 In other words, the beliefs, behaviour and actions of sick people who did not go to the doctor and remained \u2018non-patients\u2019. To explore the \u2018non-patient\u2019s view\u2019, we have to look beyond self-care and the use of proprietary remedies and alternative medicine. The sociological term of the \u2018symptom iceberg\u2019, which refers to the aches and ailments that never reach the doctor, is used as a guide. In turn, historical examples to the following responses to symptoms are discussed: doing nothing; prayer; finding information; looking to family and friends; over-the-counter medicines. The chapter suggests how historians can research the \u2018non-patient\u2019s view\u2019, by interrogating familiar sources in new ways and finding novel sources, many of which will have previously been regarded as non-medical. Finally, the chapter considers the policy implications of this work in terms of recent attempts to ease pressures on healthcare systems that encourage people \u2018not to see the doctor\u2019 and opt for self-care",

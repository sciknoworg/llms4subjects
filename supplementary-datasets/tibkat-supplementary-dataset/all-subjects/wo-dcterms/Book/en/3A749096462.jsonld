            "title": "Error-Control Coding for Data Networks",
            "abstract": "The subject of error-control coding bridges several disciplines, in particular mathematics, electrical engineering and computer science. The theory of error-control codes is often described abstractly in mathematical terms only, for the benefit of other coding specialists. Such a theoretical approach to coding makes it difficult for engineers to understand the underlying concepts of error correction, the design of digital error-control systems, and the quantitative behavior of such systems. In this book only a minimal amount of mathematics is introduced in order to describe the many, sometimes mathematical, aspects of error-control coding. The concepts of error correction and detection are in many cases sufficiently straightforward to avoid highly theoretical algebraic constructions. The reader will find that the primary emphasis of the book is on practical matters, not on theoretical problems. In fact, much of the material covered is summarized by examples of real developments, and almost all of the error-correction and detection codes introduced are attached to related practical applications. Error-Control Coding for Data Networks takes a structured approach to channel-coding, starting with the basic coding concepts and working gradually towards the most sophisticated coding systems. The most popular applications are described throughout the book. These applications include the channel-coding techniques used in mobile communication systems, such as: the global system for mobile communications (GSM) and the code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system, coding schemes for High-Definition TeleVision (HDTV) system, the Compact Disk (CD), and Digital Video Disk (DVD), as well as the error-control protocols for the data-link layers of networks, and much more. The book is compiled carefully to bring engineers, coding specialists, and students up to date in the important modern coding technologies. Both electrical engineering students and communication engineers will benefit from the information in this largely self-contained text on error-control system engineering",

                "This book discusses a crucial paradigm shift in urban planning and architectural design, addressing the urgent need for sustainability and adaptation in the face of rapidly changing climate and urban landscapes. Ideal for urban planners, architects, researchers, and policymakers, this book weaves together cutting-edge research and innovative applications from the 7th edition of the international conference on Urban Planning and Architectural Design for Sustainable Development organized by IEREK in collaboration with the Architecture Department at the University of Florence, Italy. Through a collection of double-blind peer-reviewed papers, it offers a cohesive narrative emphasizing the vital role of spatial design at all scales. Readers will explore diverse case studies, from bustling megacities to forgotten villages, showcasing the local impacts of global challenges and the efforts to prevent, neutralize or mitigate them. With an insightful blend of qualitative and quantitative methods, the book uncovers the multi-functionality of blue-green infrastructure, the potentials of urban voids, and the urgent need for ecological transition. Unveiling the gap between current governance instruments and pressing challenges, this book serves as a compass for crafting inclusive, livable, and environmentally conscious cities and communities."

                "This open access book explores different landscapes of Lifelong Learning policies (LLP), producing case-based examinations of their institutional, discursive, and relational dimensions. Across Europe, young people develop their life courses amidst diverse living conditions and are confronted with a variety of institutional and structural arrangements that impact on their opportunities in education and labour. Considering the relevance of LLP in shaping those opportunities, the chapters draw from multi-level, mixed-methods research and offer original insights on the interplay of discourses and governance patterns in the processes of policy-making and deliverance. The book yields noteworthy insights into the widely differing realities across the European landscape, and also into the diverging ways young people deal with and actively participate in LLP. Sebastiano Benasso is Senior Assistant Professor at the Department of Educational Sciences, University of Genoa, Italy. His research focuses on biographical transitions, generations and youth cultures. Dejana Bouillet is Professor at the Faculty of Teacher Education, University of Zagreb, Croatia. She teaches inclusive and social pedagogy and researches a wide range of etiological, phenomenological and intervention aspects of socialisation problems of youths. Tiago Neves is Associate Professor at the Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences at the University of Porto, Portugal. His research focuses on social and educational inequalities, in particular on compensatory education and access to higher education. Marcelo Parreira do Amaral is Professor of International and Comparative Education at the University of M\u00fcnster, Germany. His main research interests include international comparative education, education policy, international educational governance and its implications for educational trajectories. ."

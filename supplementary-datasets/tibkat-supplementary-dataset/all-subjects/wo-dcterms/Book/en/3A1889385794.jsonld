            "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are increasingly placing significant health and economic burdens on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Primary care serves as the initial point of contact for individuals seeking medical assistance and plays a pivotal role in promoting health, preventing diseases, and managing chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory illnesses. By embedding NCD services within primary health care (PHC) settings, individuals receive timely screening, diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing support, leading to improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. The World Bank has significantly increased its investments in NCD management, particularly over the past decade. The aim of this report is to collate real-world examples showcasing the integration of best practices for managing NCDs within PHC systems. This anthology accompanies the NCD system assessment tool, which aims to support World Bank country teams to a rapidly (~3 months) assess gaps implementation of a set of best practices for NCD prevention and management. Specifically, the tool evaluates health systems against 43 best practices - practical policies, plans, programs or structures - recommended by global consensus panels or proven to be effective in meta-analyses, systematic reviews and Cochrane reviews. These best practices that make up the assessment tool are the foundation of the case studies in this anthology. Drawing on desk-based review of available data, peer-reviewed and grey literature, and a small set of key informant interviews, the cases in this anthology detail the successes, challenges, and lessons learned from the adoption of these best practices in diverse country contexts",

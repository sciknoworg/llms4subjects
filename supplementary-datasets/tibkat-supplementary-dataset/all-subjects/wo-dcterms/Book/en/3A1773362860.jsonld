                "A decade since deforestation was taken up by climate negotiators, an internationally agreed-upon framework of rules and protocols shapes the simple pay-for-performance approach to reducing deforestation and encouraging sustainable forest management. But deforestation of the world's tropical forests continues apace, and relatively little of the money available for forest conservation and sustainable management \"pays for performance.\" Yet forests occupy a unique space in the pay-for-performance discussion. Changes in forest cover are now relatively easy to observe and measure, thanks to satellite-based technologies and the growing capacity of forested countries for on-the-ground verification. And forests are a double win, twice over: They are a win for both climate and development, at the global level and the forested country level. Though currently undervalued in the race to avert catastrophic global climate change, in forested countries forests are a key to reducing drought and flooding, protecting watersheds, and supplying sustainable livelihoods to people living in and around them. They simultaneously fix carbon, a global benefit, and increase resilience to climate change, protecting agriculture, water supplies, and the people most vulnerable to extreme weather and natural disasters, a local benefit",

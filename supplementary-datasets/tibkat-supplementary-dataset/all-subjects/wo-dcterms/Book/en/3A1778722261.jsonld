            "abstract": "Robotic surgery is still in the early stages even though robotic assisted surgery is increasing continuously. Thus, exact and careful understanding of robotic surgery is necessary because chaos and confusion exist in the early phase of anything. Especially, the confusion may be increased because the robotic equipment, which is used in surgery, is different from the robotic equipment used in the automobile factory. The robots in the automobile factory just follow a program. However, the robot in surgery has to follow the surgeon\u2019s hand motions. I am convinced that this In-Tech Robotic Surgery book will play an essential role in giving some solutions to the chaos and confusion of robotic surgery. The In-Tech Surgery book contains 11 chapters and consists of two main sections. The first section explains general concepts and technological aspects of robotic surgery. The second section explains the details of surgery using a robot for each organ system. I hope that all surgeons who are interested in robotic surgery will find the proper knowledge in this book. Moreover, I hope the book will perform as a basic role to create future prospectives. Unfortunately, this book could not cover all areas of robotic assisted surgery such as robotic assisted gastrectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy. I expect that future editions will cover many more areas of robotic assisted surgery and it can be facilitated by dedicated readers. Finally, I appreciate all authors who sacrificed their time and effort to write this book. I must thank my wife NaYoung for her support and also acknowledge MiSun Park\u2019s efforts in helping to complete the book",

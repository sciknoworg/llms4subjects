                "\"Simplify the estimating process with the latest data, materials, and practicesElectrical Estimating Methods, Fourth Edition is a comprehensive guide to estimating electrical costs, with data provided by leading construction database RS Means. The book covers the materials and processes encountered by the modern contractor, and provides all the information professionals need to make the most precise estimate. The fourth edition has been updated to reflect the changing materials, techniques, and practices in the field, and provides the most recent Means cost data available. The complexity of electrical systems can make accurate estimation difficult, but this guide contains all the necessary information in one place.An electrical estimate represents the total cost for materials, labor, overhead and profit, but accuracy is virtually impossible without a basic knowledge of the field, and real-world experience in the type of work required. Inaccurate estimates lead to problems with customer satisfaction, which often create payment issues. A thorough, complete, and accurate estimate is in the best interest of all parties involved in the work. Electrical Estimating Methods provides more than just data. Detailed discussions about the work itself help highlight factors that may escape notice, and access to the latest cost data helps tie everything together. Features include:  Discussion of current equipment, materials, and processes  Means data for both residential and commercial projects  Case studies that illustrate best practices  Online access to the latest Means data for fast access on the job  The book discusses specific situations as well as general practices, and provides comprehensive guidance to the creation of a true, current, estimation of costs. For electrical contractors and estimators, Electrical Estimating Methods contains must-have content that simplifies the estimating process\"--"

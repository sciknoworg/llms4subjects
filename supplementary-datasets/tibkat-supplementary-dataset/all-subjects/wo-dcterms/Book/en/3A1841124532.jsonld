            "abstract": "In 2011, the Pomerania region of Poland set up Invest in Pomerania (IiP) as its regional investment promotion agency. Several local institutions together launched IiP to ensure regional coordination of FDI attraction and investment promotion opportunities. The goal was to create a single entity that would effectively attract and facilitate FDI in the region and that would also act as an interface between investors, local authorities, and other stakeholders. While starting off small, the agency has developed significantly since its inception. With a total of twenty-two employees, the agency today has a number of functions, including promoting investment, providing matchmaking services, promoting innovation, developing local suppliers, functioning as a one-stop-shop, and promoting domestic investment. This report assesses the impact of IiP on Pomerania's economic performance in the period from 2011 to 2021. Upon reaching its ten-year anniversary, the agency seeks to better understand its contributions to attracting FDI and to the region's economic development objectives. Currently, IiP is developing its new investment promotion strategy for 2022-2027. By looking back to assess the agency's impact while also drawing out major IiP's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, this report evaluates past performance while also informing the agency's future development path",

This unique and original book improves upon the shortcomings of competitive titles by providing complete, in-depth coverage of the equipment and techniques used in the most popular welding processes: oxyacetylene, stick welding, MIG welding and TIG welding. What's more, it presents information in a lively, easy-to-follow design. Each chapter contains the pros and cons of each process and information on equipment, setup, materials, safety and welding techniques. To provide a solid footing for the novice welder, there is a chapter that provides an overview of welding and another on tools and materials. The bulk of the book is devoted to the more popular welding techniques. The authors also provide a chapter on soldering and brazing and another on plasma cutting. The Art of Welding is perfect for anyone who wants to learn welding, to make repairs or as part of a hobby. Even experienced welders will discover many tips and procedures to improve their welding technique",

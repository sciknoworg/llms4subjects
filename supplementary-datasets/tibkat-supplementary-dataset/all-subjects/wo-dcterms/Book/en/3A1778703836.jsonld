            "title": "Indoor and Outdoor Air Pollution",
            "abstract": "Air pollutants are continuously released from numerous sources into the atmosphere. Several studies have been carried out on the quantification of pollutants and their consequences on public health. Identification of the source characteristics of air pollution is an important step in the development of regional air quality control strategies. Air quality is a measure of the degree of ambient atmospheric pollution. Deterioration and damage to both public health and environment due to poor air quality have been recognized at a legislative and international level. In consequence, indoor and outdoor air quality must also be considered. This book tries to reveal different points of view of the wide concept of air quality in two different sections. In this context, there will be an initial introductory chapter on the main concepts of air quality, following which there will be real case studies on outdoor and indoor air quality with an aim to provide a guideline for future standards and research works",

            "abstract": "Machining constitutes one of the most significant categories of manufacturing, being used in final component production, including both special and precision parts, as well as difficult-to-machine materials, and meeting high performance/quality requirements. Machining is also influenced by the continuously evolving quality/productivity requirements of modern industry, together with the innovative aspects of new and advanced materials in combination with the energy and environmental (green/clean) regulations imposed in industry. The tribological performance of alloys constitutes a significant property related to the lifetime and reliability of metallic components during their production and/or service conditions. Therefore, tribological performance can also be considered as a relevant and interconnected parameter of machinability. The study of tribological behavior also includes the surface engineering aspects of modern and conventional alloys in a more general framework of industrial component production and/or endurance in a harsh working environment. The core aim of this Special Issue is to present studies focusing on the manufacturing/machinability and tribological behavior of alloys, including the application of advanced surface treatments for wear resistance. The emergence of new and eco-friendly alloys for superior machinability performance is a key purpose of this reprint",

            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).The aim of this publication is to acquaint those readers who are interested in the fundamentals of powder materials sintering, with the latest scientific achievements which are important to its successful practice. The book contains new information, not previously known in the West, as well as offering a totally fresh view of this vital issue. The work discloses to western eyes a new scientific trend in the science of sintering systems with interacting components; a trend of which many experts are unaware. The new approach will considerably enrich and advance investigations into the theory and practice of sintering and aid their further development. A superficial survey of the book may give the impression that it is devoted to the investigation of the peculiarities of certain individual systems during sintering. Such an impression would be entirely false, because the concrete systems were mainly selected as archetypal examples via which to demonstrate the successful outcome of applying the new concepts. More detailed acquaintance with the book will convince the reader that it furnishes a deep understanding of the processes taking place during sintering in the stage where chemical equilibrium of the system is established. This largely unrecognised stage is the principal one in interacting systems.The essence of the new concepts is explained as simply as possible, and in every detail, and is sure to be welcomed by researchers and specialists, as well as by students and practising engineers. Savitskii (Russian Academy of Sciences) develops a model for a two-component powder compact and its changes in volume during solid and liquid phase sintering. The work furnishes a quantitative description of the volume changes of compacts on the basis of a direct determination of the stages of liquid phase sintering using dilatometry, microstructural studies and experimental verification of the analytical calculations. The author also outlines criteria for selecting additives, their concentrations, and sintering regimes for controlling the microstructure of the material being sintered. Previously published as Liquid phase sintering of systems with interacting components in 1993, the new edition adds two chapters and 111 references.",

            "abstract": "In 1991, Sne\u017eana \u017dabi\u0107 lost her homeland and most of her family\u2019s book and record collection during the Yugoslav Wars that had been sparked by Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s relentless pursuit of power. She became a teenage refugee, forced to flee Croatia and the atrocities of war that had leveled her hometown of Vukovar. She and her family remained refugees in Serbia until NATO bombed Belgrade in 1999.  After witnessing the first nights of NATO\u2019s bombing, \u017dabi\u0107 took flight again. She moved from country to country, city to city, finally settling in Chicago. She realized \u2014 reluctantly, because she didn\u2019t want to relive the past \u2014 that she had to write about what had happened, what she had left behind, and what she had lost. Broken Records is the story of this loss, told with unflinching honesty, free of sentimentality or sensationalism. For the very first time, we learn how it felt to be first a regular teenager during the breakup of Yugoslavia and the ensuing wars, and then a 30-something adult, perennially troubled by one\u2019s uprooted existence.  Broken Records is not a neat narrative but a bit of everything \u2014 part bildungsroman, part memoir, part political poetry, part personal pop culture compendium. And while \u017dabi\u0107 represents a Yugoslav diasporan subject, her book also belongs to an international generation whose formative years straddle the Cold War and the global reconfiguration of wealth and power, whose lives were spent shifting from the vinyl/analog era to the cyber/digital era. This generation knows that when they were told about history ending, they were told a lie",

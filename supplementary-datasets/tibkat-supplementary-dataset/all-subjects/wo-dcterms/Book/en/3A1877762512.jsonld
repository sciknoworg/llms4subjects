It seems that there is no time for the basic science plant research; instead of years of dedicated investigation, scientists are forced to wrap up their know-how in a project-oriented deliverables as fast as possible. The main strength of this book is the new knowledge about plant engineering that could be transferred into the applied science and, later on, to the industry. However, we should not forget that all great discoveries begin with the fundamental research, the wealth of good ideas and the dedicated scientific work",

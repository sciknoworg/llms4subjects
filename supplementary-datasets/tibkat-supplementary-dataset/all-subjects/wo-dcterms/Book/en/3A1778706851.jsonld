            "abstract": "This book considers diagnosis and treatment of abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms. It addresses vascular and cardiothoracic surgeons and interventional radiologists, but also anyone engaged in vascular medicine. The book focuses amongst other things on operations in the ascending aorta and the aortic arch. Surgical procedures in this area have received increasing attention in the last few years and have been subjected to several modifications. Especially the development of interventional radiological endovascular techniques that reduce the invasive nature of surgery as well as complication rates led to rapid advancements. Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair still remains a challenging operation since it necessitates extended exposure of the aorta and reimplantation of the vital aortic branches. Among possible postoperative complications, spinal cord injury (SCI) seems one of the most formidable morbidities. Strategies for TAAA repair and the best and most reasonable approach to prevent SCI after TAAA repair are presented",

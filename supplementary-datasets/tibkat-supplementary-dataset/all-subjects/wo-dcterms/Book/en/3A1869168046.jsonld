            "abstract": "Advanced intelligent control is a rapidly developing, complex and challenging field with significant practical importance and potential applications. The authors aim to stimulate advancements in science and technology by addressing this field and presenting new trends in the design, control and applications of real-time intelligent sensor system control using advanced intelligent control methods and techniques. The purpose of the Special Issue is to promote in-depth research and communication regarding these topics. The authors focus on innovative multi-sensor fusion techniques integrated into robots, which are combined with computer vision, virtual and augmented reality (VR&AR) and intelligent communication including remote control, adaptive sensor networks and human\u2013robot (H2R) interaction systems. Special attention is given to advancements in sensors, actuators, computation technology and communication networks that provide the necessary tools for implementing intelligent control hardware. These advancements are targeted toward various scientific research fields, including machine learning (such as deep learning), bio-inspired algorithms, recurrent neural networks, neuro-fuzzy control and artificial intelligence in general. The Special Issue includes original research papers that report on the recent advancements in intelligent control using intelligent sensors. It serves as a further extension of the previously successful Special Issue, \u201cAdvanced Intelligent Control through Versatile Intelligent Portable Platforms\u201d",

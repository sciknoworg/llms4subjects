                "David Hughes was one of the few academics who questioned the mainstream narrative following the attacks that triggered the War on Terror. That gave him a crucial advantage when the Covid emergency was declared. In this provocative study he explores in depth how governments have declared war on their populations to achieve a transformation to a technocratic dictatorship. The combination with psychological techniques developed over many decades makes this a particularly grave danger, which requires careful dissection to be understood and resisted. This book, the first of a two-volume set, provides that analysis. ~ Kees van der Pijl, author of States of Emergency. Keeping the Global Population in Check (Clarity Press, 2022) (The Netherlands) The silent coup engineering global central control depends heavily on asymmetrical warfare \u2013 including extensive investment in and application of psychological and neurological weaponry. In this book, David Hughes documents the development and application of a wide portfolio of soft and hard \u2013 and often invisible \u2013 weapons to brutally manipulate minds and emotions to engineer the adoption of technocracy. The first step to not falling victim is to see these 21st century weapons of war clearly. Hughes\u2019 formidable scholarship helps you to do so. ~ Catherine Austin Fitts, Publisher, The Solari Report (United States) David A. Hughes is Senior Lecturer in International Relations at the University of Lincoln. He received his undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees from Oxford University and holds doctorates in German Studies (Duke University) and International Relations (Oxford Brookes University). His research focuses on psychological warfare, \"9/11,\" \"Covid-19,\" the deep state, technocracy, global class relations, and resurgent totalitarianism. Camouflaged by \u201cCovid-19,\u201d an undeclared global class war was initiated in 2020, aimed at replacing liberal democracy with technocracy, a novel, biodigital form of totalitarianism. The opening campaign involved the largest psychological operation in history, intended to demoralise, disorientate, and debilitate the public. This volume deals with the application of shock and stress, trauma-based mind control, the use of fear and threat, cognitive attack, weaponised deception, and techniques for turning society against itself."

            "abstract": "Polynomial and its applications are well known for their proven properties and excellent applicability in interdisciplinary fields of science. Until now, research on polynomial and its applications has been done in mathematics, applied mathematics, and sciences. This book is based on recent results in all areas related to polynomial and its applications. This book provides an overview of the current research in the field of polynomials and its applications. The following papers have been published in this volume: \u2018A Parametric Kind of the Degenerate Fubini Numbers and Polynomials\u2019; \u2018On 2-Variables Konhauser Matrix Polynomials and Their Fractional Integrals\u2019; \u2018Fractional Supersymmetric Hermite Polynomials\u2019; \u2018Rational Approximation for Solving an Implicitly Given Colebrook Flow Friction Equation\u2019; \u2018Iterating the Sum of M\u00f6bius Divisor Function and Euler Totient Function\u2019; \u2018Differential Equations Arising from the Generating Function of the (r, \u03b2)-Bell Polynomials and Distribution of Zeros of Equations\u2019; \u2018Truncated Fubini Polynomials\u2019; \u2018On Positive Quadratic Hyponormality of a Unilateral Weighted Shift with Recursively Generated by Five Weights\u2019; \u2018Ground State Solutions for Fractional Choquard Equations with Potential Vanishing at Infinity\u2019; \u2018Some Identities on Degenerate Bernstein and Degenerate Euler Polynomials\u2019; \u2018Some Identities Involving Hermite Kamp\u00e9 de F\u00e9riet Polynomials Arising from Differential Equations and Location of Their Zeros.\u2019",

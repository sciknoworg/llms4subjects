            "abstract": "\"The third edition of Fire Retardancy of Polymeric Materials provides a single source for all aspects of this highly challenging field of applied research. This authoritative book covers design and non-fire requirements that drive how these materials are fire protected. Detailed study and consideration of chemistry, physics, materials science, economic issues and fire safety science is necessary to address considerations of mechanical, thermal, environmental, and end-use requirements on top of fire protection mean that the field requires. This thoroughly revised new edition continues to offer comprehensive coverage of the scientific approach for those developing fire safe materials. It covers new topics such as bio-based materials, regulatory issues, recycling, newer flame retardant chemical classes, and more details on how to flame retard materials for specific market applications. Written by a team of experts, this book covers the fundamentals of polymer burning and combustion and how to apply fire protection or flame-retardant chemistries to specific material classes and applications. The book is written for material scientists and fire safety scientists who seek to develop new fire safe materials or understand why materials burn in our modern environment. Features Connects fundamentals of material flammability to practical fire safety needs. Covers current fire safety requirements and regulations affecting flame retardant selection. Provides information on chemical structure-property relationships for flame retardancy. Provides practical guidance on how to design fire safe materials for specific fire risk scenarios. The new edition is expanded to 32 chapters and all chapters are updated and revised with the newest information\"--",

            "abstract": "The aim of this reprint was to report recent innovative studies based on the use of secondary raw materials for applications in civil and environmental engineering. To this purpose, papers were related to the preparation of innovative construction materials and to the treatment of wastes for environmental applications. The investigations were characterized by a common purpose, i.e., to find a way to reduce the amount of waste generated, thus reducing the need for landfilling and optimizing the values of these novel materials, which are an abundant resource that can be easily reused for different applications",

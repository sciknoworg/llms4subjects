            "title": "Vietnam as if\u2026 Tales of youth, love and destiny",
            "abstract": "Vietnam as if\u2026 follows five young people who have moved from the countryside to the city. Their dramatic everyday lives illuminate some of the most pressing issues in Vietnam today: \u2018The Sticky Rice Seller\u2019 explores gender roles; \u2018The Ball Boy\u2019 is all about the struggles of sexual and ethnic minorities; \u2018The Professional\u2019 examines relations between rich and poor; \u2018The Goalkeeper\u2019 delves into politics and ideology; and \u2018The Student\u2019 reflects upon family and faith. The stories also reboot several classics of Vietnamese literature for the twenty-first century, including \u2018Floating Dumplings\u2019 by feminist poet Ho Xuan Huong, Vu Trong Phung\u2019s satire of French colonialism Dumb Luck, Nguyen Du\u2019s epic account of fate and sacrifice \u2018The Tale of Kieu\u2019, and the proclamations of Ho Chi Minh. These novellas reveal the deepest sentiments of Vietnamese youth as they \u2013 like youth everywhere \u2013 come of age, fall in love and contest their destiny. In 2011 Kim Huynh returned to Vietnam, having left more than three decades earlier. He had few plans other than to experience as much of his birthplace as possible. That year he came into contact with a wide range of people and took on many trades. Kim drank and dined with government officials, went on pilgrimages with corporate tycoons and marched in the streets against foreign aggression. He sold sticky rice, was a tennis player and also a ball boy, attended all manner of rituals and celebrations, eavesdropped on people in caf\u00e9s and restaurants, and went back to the classroom as both a student and a teacher. Rich in detail and broad in scope, these tales capture Kim\u2019s experiences and imaginings of Vietnam as if\u2026",

            "abstract": "Groves Conference on Marriage and Family: History & Impact on Family Science offers family scholars and practitioners a detailed history of the Groves Conference from its origin in 1934 to the present day. Founded by Ernest R. Groves as a cutting-edge organization for understanding families, its history portrays a time of social transformation and the press for equity in such areas as race, ethnicity, gender, and social and geographic mobility as the conferences addressed unchallenged assumptions in the field of family science. The Groves Conference on Marriage and Family continues to meet each year across the United States and internationally to explore how families can be resilient in the face of changes that will affect their daily lives\u00e2now and in the future",

            "abstract": "\"The book is divided into four sections. Section One includes two chapters on history. The opening chapter of the book introduces the subject of continuing engineering education (CEE). There are general sections on continuing education and engineering education and then the subject of CEE is presented. The chapter concludes with some sources for further information including relevant organizations, journals, and workshops. The second chapter in the section is on the 50-year history of engineering distance education at Iowa State University. A timeline with notable events is presented along with the key people involved in the program. Section Two concerns instructional design and contains five chapters. The first is on the learning preferences of working engineers. It presents the results of a study on the learning strategy and verbal-visual preference of engineers working in the oil and gas industry. Section Three focuses on CEE delivery and administration. The first chapter in the section discusses the results of a survey of working engineers to determine their CEE practices and preferences. It includes results such as how many courses engineers take each year, what types of courses they take (technical; management; environment, health, and safety; legal; and other), what fraction of the course is mandatory including what fraction is required by the participant's organization and by outside organizations, the fraction of courses taken that are taken for credit, and how many courses are taken after normal working hours. Finally, section four discusses sustainability in continuing engineering education--",

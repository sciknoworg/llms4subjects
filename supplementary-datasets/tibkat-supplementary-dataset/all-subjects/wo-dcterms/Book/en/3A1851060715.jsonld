                "This path-breaking volume examines the transformation of social democracy in the four countries of Visegr\u00e1d. Rich in detail and cogently argued, the work is a major contribution to debates about the changing nature of social democracy across Europe, and will be required reading for scholars and students alike. Patrick Diamond, Professor of Public Policy, Queen Mary University of London A group of renowned NGO experts from progressive think-tanks have authored a must-read primer for everyone interested in the challenges of contemporary politics in Europe. From progressivism to illiberalism, the book delivers a particularly insightful glimpse at the political currents of Central Europe. An important contribution to the debate on the future of social democracy in Europe. Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski, President of Poland (1995-2005) This volume is an essential contribution to the European debate about the state and future of social democracy in Central and Eastern Europe. Being completed with academic precision and an excellent understanding of the socio-economic reality of the country case studies, the book is a long-awaited, absolute must-read. Biljana Borzan, Vice-President of the S&D Group in the European Parliament and MEP This book provides an in-depth analysis of the social democratic parties in the four member states of the so-called \u201cVisegr\u00e1d Group\u201d- Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The timeline spans the last two decades, which saw the parties in question come to power, govern and collapse. The case studies of all four countries are structured in the same way, offering: explanation of the historical background (including electoral results), analyses of the context, structures, membership and voters; evaluation of the programmes and hypotheses for potential future trajectories. Given the European relevance of the topic, the fifth chapter provides a comparative analysis, with a handful of explanations as to why Visegr\u00e1d Group countries have proved to be tough partners in European integration processes.

Andr\u00e1s B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy is Director of Policy Solutions and Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Social Sciences, Hungary. .",

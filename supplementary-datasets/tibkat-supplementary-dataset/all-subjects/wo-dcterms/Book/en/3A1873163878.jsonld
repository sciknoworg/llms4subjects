                "This book explores, from a high level, the parallels between the evolution of humans and the evolution of machines. The book reviews practical questions about the future of AI but also engages in philosophical discussions about what machine intelligence could mean for the human experience. The book focuses on what is intelligence and what separates intelligent species from non-so-intelligent ones. It concludes this section with the description of true nature of human intelligence can be. We discuss how we looked at machines few hundred years back and how their definition and the expectations from them has changed over time. We will consider when and how machines became intelligent and then explore in depth he latest developments in artificial intelligence with explanation of deep learning technology and humanlike chat interface provided with products like ChatGPT. We will define both human intelligence and artificial intelligence and the distinction between the two. In the third and final section of the book, we will focus on near- and longer-term futures with widespread use of machine intelligence, making the whole ambient environment that we will live in intelligent How is this going to change human lives, and what parts of human life will be encroached with machines and their intelligence? We will explore how the job market will look with some jobs being taken by machines, and if this is overall a positive or negative change. What You Will Learn How human intelligence is connected with artificial intelligence as well as the differences How AI is going to change our lives in the coming years, decades and centuries An explanation of deep learning technology and humanlike chat interface provided with products like ChatGPT Who This Book is For Readers looking to contextualize the evolution of artificial intelligence in human history.",

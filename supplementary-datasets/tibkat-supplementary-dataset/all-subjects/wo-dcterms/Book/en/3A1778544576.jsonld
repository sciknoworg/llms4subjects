            "abstract": "The volume aims to provide an updated overview of School Geography as an inclusive knowledge. As teachers and citizens, we daily deal with the differences we meet. Working and living with a group of students implies, in fact, working and living in contact with the difference, defined by its dimensions: gender, physical ability, cultural heritage, social or economic backgrounds. Following this perspective, the \u201cOfficine didattiche\u201d are thought of as a powerful opportunity in fostering the integration between methodological frameworks and educational practices. Inspired by the experience of the \u201cOfficine didattiche\u201d, organized during the 59\u00b0 Convegno Nazionale AIIG (held from September 29th to October 3rd, 2016 at the Facolt\u00e0 di Lettere e Filosofia \u2013 Universit\u00e0 La Sapienza), the book has been set as an operative tool for teachers. The authors of the contributions integrated theoretical reflections with the didactic relevance emerged from their training experiences. The main aim of this volume is to provide methodological and practical supports and to act as an operative source in planning and conducting training courses for teachers. The contributions are organized in three parts: \"Corpi\", \"Strumenti\" and \"Narrazioni\", re-proposing the guiding themes of the \u201cOfficine\u201d set in Rome. Furthermore, these three \u201cparts\u201d work as thematic axes connecting the book to the contemporary debate on school and children Geographies",

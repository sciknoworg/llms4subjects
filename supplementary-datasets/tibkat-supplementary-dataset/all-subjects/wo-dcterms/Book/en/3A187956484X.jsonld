            "abstract": "\"Advances in Sewn Product Technology describes the advancements in sewn product technology covering instrumentation, control and robotics leading to an insight into the pragmatic practicalities and science of stitching textile materials. It provides useful and helpful instructions and guidelines describing technical details of the pertinent machinery used in the sewn product industry. Further, it describes various areas of stitching technology (sew-free/no-seam) and techniques (single-needle, hand, lock, multi-thread, cover stitching and overlocking/overedging) including stitching needles and threads. Concepts are supported by inimitable examples and case studies from industry. The book provides an understanding of the machinery involved in stitching materials and describes advancements in sewn product technology, instrumentation, and control. It exclusively covers predicting fabric sewablity using fabric-oriented management. Further more, it includes sections on quality control in sewn products, robotics, and digital technology in apparel industry, enabling the reader to diagnose problem by product analyst and provide solutions supported by dedicated chapter on real-time case studies. This book is aimed at manufacturing, and production, engineers, designers, product developers, managers, academics and researchers working with sewn products, graduate students in textile engineering, clothing, fashion and technology\"--",

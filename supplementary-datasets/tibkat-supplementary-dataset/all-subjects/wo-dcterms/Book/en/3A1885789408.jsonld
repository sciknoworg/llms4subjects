            "abstract": "Norwegian egalitarianism refers to the social, political, and cultural practices that promote equality, autonomy, and social justice in Norwegian society. This edited book critically explores the contradictions and paradoxes that challenge the notion of contemporary Norway as an egalitarian society. Through different vantage points, the chapters in this book address how Norwegian egalitarianism is both reproduced and undermined through different practices and institutions in Norwegian society. As such, the book explores the impact of key societal processes, such as globalization, liberalization, and immigration, and argue that Norwegian egalitarianism must be treated as a changing cultural and political phenomenon informed by both normative ideals and political realities. The book aims to encourage new debates about Norwegian egalitarianism, including its trajectories and usefulness as a concept for analyzing change and continuity in Norwegian society",

            "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world as we know it. Recent advances are enabling people, companies, and governments to envision and experiment with new methods of interacting with computers and modifying how virtual and physical processes are carried out. One of the fields in which this transformation is taking place is education. After years of witnessing the incorporation of technological innovations into learning/teaching processes, we can currently observe many new research works involving AI. Moreover, there has been increasing interest in this research area after the COVID-19 pandemic, driven toward fostering digital education. Among recent research in this field, AI applications have been applied to enhance educational experiences, studies have considered the interaction between AI and humans while learning, analyses of educational data have been conducted, including using machine learning techniques, and proposals have been presented for new paradigms mediated by intelligent agents. This book, entitled \u201cAI in Education\u201d, aims to highlight recent research in the field of AI and education. The included works discuss new advances in methods, applications, and procedures to enhance educational processes via artificial intelligence and its subfields (machine learning, neural networks, deep learning, cognitive computing, natural language processing, computer vision, etc.)",

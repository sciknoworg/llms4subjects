                "This book features a collection of high-quality and peer-reviewed papers from 2023 14th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, which was held in Shandong, China, during November 23\u201325, 2023. ICEST is held annually as a platform for presentation of new advances and research results in the fields of Environmental Science and Technology. With the continuous development of human society, environmental problems are becoming more and more serious. Recently, we face some difficult problems such as: global climate change, ozone layer destruction and depletion, acid rain pollution, desertification, and water resources crisis. Based on the theme this year, the presentations include the topical areas of environmental sustainability, waste minimization, solid waste management, water pollution control, water treatment and reclamation, air pollution control, carbon capture and storage and environmental monitoring, etc.",

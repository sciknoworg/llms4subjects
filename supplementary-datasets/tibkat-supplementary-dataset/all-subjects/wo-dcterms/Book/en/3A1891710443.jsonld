E. Tobias and Benjamin William Brown. Their narratives are reproduced alongside an in-depth introductory essay, author biographies, scholarly annotations and a detailed bibliography.All these authors testify to their lifelong \u2018fight for freedom\u2019 across their radical and revolutionary works. Throughout their lives, they warred against the \u2018sufferings and horrors\u2019 of enslavement as a centuries-old \u2018cursed institution.\u2019 \u2018Words are weapons\u2019 in their fight for Black liberation. Across their life\u2019s works, they protested against the rise of the \u2018spirit of slavery\u2019 in white supremacist and white racist American and British transatlantic societies",

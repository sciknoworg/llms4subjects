This book demonstrates the potential and actual developments in the design and development of physical chemistry strategies and tools for the food science and technology. Chapters cover many topics in this field, including nutritional and pharmaceutical properties and analysis, electroanalytical and electrochemical techniques, valorization of food residues, bioactives and bioactivities, separative extraction, microencapsulation, nanoemulsions, and much more. Several chapters address how the food industry generates a large amount of agroindustrial waste that seriously affects the environment and present mitigation strategies and technology to use these agroindustrial waste products to produce bioactive compounds that can add value to food products. Certain fruit and vegetable species are discussed as a potential new source for its use their raw materials of use in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. The information and research provided here will be of great interest and support for research scientists, industry professionals, and advanced students involved in food science and technology\"--",

The book is written in three parts: Part I covers the fundamentals of thermodynamics; Part II is on gas dynamics; and Part III focuses on combustion. Chapters are written in a clear and concise manner and include examples and problems to support the concepts outlined in the text. The book begins with a discussion of the fundamentals of thermodynamics and includes a thorough analysis of engineering devices. The book moves on to address applications in gas dynamics and combustion to include advance topics such as two-phase critical flow and blast theory. Written for use in Introduction to Thermodynamics, Advanced Thermodynamics, and Introduction to Combustion courses, this book uniquely covers thermodynamics, gas dynamics and combustion in a clear and concise manner, showing the integral connections at an advanced undergraduate or lower graduate student level. \u2022 Presents a thorough overview of the fundamentals of thermodynamics; \u2022 Contains end of chapter questions, worked examples, and solutions; \u2022 Provides ancillary materials to support the concepts outlined in the text.",

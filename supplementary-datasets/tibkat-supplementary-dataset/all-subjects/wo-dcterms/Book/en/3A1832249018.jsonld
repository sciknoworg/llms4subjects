            "title": "Running Dynamics of Rail Vehicles",
            "abstract": "The investigation of rail vehicle running dynamics plays an important role in the more than 200 year development of railway vehicles and infrastructure. Currently, there are a number of new requirements for rail transport associated with the reduced environmental impact, energy consumption and wear, whilst increasing train speed and passenger comfort. Therefore, the running dynamics of rail vehicles is still a research topic that requires improved simulation tools and experimental procedures. The book focuses on the current research topics in railway vehicles running dynamics. Special attention is given to high-speed railway transport, acoustic and vibrational impact of railway transport to the surroundings, optimization of energy supply systems for railway transport, traction drives optimization and wear of wheels and rails",

            "abstract": "This Special Issue brings together original research papers, in all areas of mathematics, that are concerned with inequalities or the role of inequalities. The research results presented in this Special Issue are related to improvements in classical inequalities, highlighting their applications and promoting an exchange of ideas between mathematicians from many parts of the world dedicated to the theory of inequalities. This volume will be of interest to mathematicians specializing in inequality theory and beyond. Many of the studies presented here can be very useful in demonstrating new results. It is our great pleasure to publish this book. All contents were peer-reviewed by multiple referees and published as papers in our Special Issue in the journal Symmetry. These studies give new and interesting results in mathematical inequalities enabling readers to obtain the latest developments in the fields of mathematical inequalities. Finally, we would like to thank all the authors who have published their valuable work in this Special Issue. We would also like to thank the editors of the journal Symmetry for their help in making this volume, especially Mrs. Teresa Yu",

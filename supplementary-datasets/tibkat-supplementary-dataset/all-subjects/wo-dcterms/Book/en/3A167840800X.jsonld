                "Filmmaker, film essayist, installation artist, writer: the Berlin artist Harun Farocki has devoted his life to the power of images. Over the thirty-plus years of his career, Farocki has explored not the images of life but rather the life of images that surrounds us in newspapers, cinema, books, television, and advertising. Harun Farocki examines, from different critical perspectives, his vast oeuvre, which includes three feature films, critical media pieces, children's television features, \"learning films\" in the tradition of Brecht, and installation pieces. Interviews, a selection of Farocki's own writings, and an annotated filmography complete a valuable biography of this pioneering artist and his legendary career",

From their personal experience, the readers can obtain a stimulating foresight on the potentialities of different synthetic and engineered biomaterials. 21 chapters have been organized to illustrate different aspects of biomaterials science. From advanced means for the characterization and toxicological assessment of new materials, through \u2018classical\u2019 applications in nanotechnology and tissue engineering, toward novel specific uses of these products, the volume wishes to give readers a view of the wide range of disciplines and methodologies that have been exploited to develop biomaterials with the physical and biological features needed for specific clinical and medical applications",

            "title": "Catalysis for the Conversion of Biomass and Its Derivatives",
            "abstract": "Biomass will play an important role in the future for the replacement of fossil sources for fuels and chemicals. Catalytic processes are required for the efficient conversion of biomass. The development of such processes and the understanding of the catalytic reactions of biomass molecules has recently attracted considerable and increasing attention. In this book, thirteen experts in different fields deliver their views on the state-of-the-art and future development of the use of biomass as a sustainable feedstock for the chemical industry. The book focuses on chemical aspects, such as catalyst development product analysis or reaction engineering, but also seeks a wider perspective and convers related issues like bioeconomics and plant growth. This book is aimed at students and scientists in the interdisciplinary field of catalysis for an introduction to the emerging field of biomass conversion and an overview on recent developments and challenges. The papers are based on lectures presented by the authors at a summer school organized by the Fritz-Haber-Institut and held in August 2010 at Kloster Seeon in Germany in the framework of the National Science Foundation-funded program Partnership in International Research and Education: Molecular Engineering for the Conversion of Biomass Derived Reactants to Fuels, Chemicals, and Materials",

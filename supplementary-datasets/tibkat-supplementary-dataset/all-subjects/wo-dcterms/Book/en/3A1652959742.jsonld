            "abstract": "This is the first book to show the capabilities of Microsoft Excel to teach physical sciences statistics effectively. It is a step-by-step exercise-driven guide for students and practitioners who need to master Excel to solve practical science problems. If understanding statistics isn\u2019t your strongest suit, you are not especially mathematically-inclined, or if you are wary of computers, this is the right book for you. Each chapter explains statistical formulas and directs the reader to use Excel commands to solve specific, easy-to-understand science problems. Practice problems are provided at the end of each chapter with their solutions in an appendix. Separately, there is a full Practice Test (with answers in an Appendix) that allows readers to test what they have learned. \u00b7         Includes 159 illustrations in color. \u00b7         Suitable for undergraduates or graduate students.

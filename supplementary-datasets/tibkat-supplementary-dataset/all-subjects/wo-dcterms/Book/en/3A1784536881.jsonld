                "\"In Corona: The Once-in-a-Century Health Crisis and Its Teachings. Towards A More Multi-Resilient Post-Corona World Roland Benedikter and Karim Fathi first describe the pluri-dimensional characteristics of the Coronavirus crisis. Then they draw the pillars for a more \"multi-resilient\" Post-Corona world including socio-political recommendations of how to generate it. The Coronavirus crisis proved to be a bundle crisis consisting of multiple, interconnected crisis dimensions. Before Corona, most concepts of a \"resilient society\" implied a rather isolated focus on only one crisis at a time. Future preparedness in the 21st century will require a multi- and transdisciplinary risk-management concept that the authors call \"multi-resilience\". \"Multi-resilience\" means to systematically enhance universal resilience competencies of societies, such as collective intelligence or overall responsiveness, being appliable to pluri-dimensional crisis contexts. If the Coronavirus crisis in retrospect will have contributed to implement multi-resilience, than it will ultimately have contributed to progress. This volume includes a Foreword by an Nederveen Pieterse and an Afterword by Manfred B. Steger\"--",

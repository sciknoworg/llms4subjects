            "title": "Middlebrow Matters : Women's reading and the literary canon in France since the Belle \u00c9poque",
            "abstract": "Middlebrow is a derogatory word that connotes blandness, mediocrity and a failed aspiration to \u2018high\u2019 culture. However, when appropriated as a positive term to denote that wide swathe of literature between the challenging experimentalism of the high and the formulaic drive of the popular, it enables a rethinking of the literary canon from the point of view of what most readers actually read, a criterion curiously absent from dominant definitions of literary value. Since women have long formed a majority of the nation\u2019s reading public, this perspective immediately feminises what has always been a very male canon. Opening with a theorisation of the concept of middlebrow that mounts a defence of some literary qualities disdained by modernism, the book then focuses on a series of case studies of periods (the Belle \u00c9poque, inter-war, early twenty-first century), authors (including Colette, Ir\u00e8ne Nemirovsky, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, Anna Gavalda) and the middlebrow nature of literary prizes",

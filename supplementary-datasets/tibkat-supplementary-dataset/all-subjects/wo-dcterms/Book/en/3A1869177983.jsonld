            "title": "Chapter 7: Marine environment and sustainable development governance",
            "abstract": "Achieving sustainability in an emerging economy characterized by increasing inequalities is challenging. Within this framework economic growth, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability are often viewed as trade-offs. Simultaneously addressing these objectives is difficult. This chapter examines the \"Sembrando Vida\" (Sowing Life) anti-poverty program in Mexico which aims to link rural poverty reduction to environmentally sustainable practices through a widespread tree planting subsidized by the government. The chapter utilizes policy coherence for development (PCD) as a methodology to highlight specific mechanisms which need to be addressed to make the program more effective and sustainable. It responds to the question: \"How can emerging states, such as Mexico, address poverty while simultaneously promoting sustainability?\"",

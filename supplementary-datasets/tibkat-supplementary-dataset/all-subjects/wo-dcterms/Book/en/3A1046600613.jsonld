            "title": "Self-regulation and Health",
            "abstract": "The purposes of this paper are to measure self-regulation, to investigate whether self-regulation differs across different health related choices, to estimate its effect on health choices and to estimate the effect of self-regulation on health-demographic gradients.  The theory and empirical approach to self-regulation employed in this paper relies on a broad literature which includes economics, psychology and experimental studies.  In addition, a novel empirical approach is employed to create a single measure of self-regulation that can vary across domains.  A single measure of self-regulation in place of a set of proxy variables allows for the study of how self-regulation is correlated across different health choices.  The results show that there is a high correlation in self-regulation for smoking, drinking, drug use, crime and gambling, but that self-regulation for BMI (body mass index) and obesity are different than self-regulation for the other outcomes.  The results show that self-regulation has a significant negative effect on all choices.  The results also show that self-regulation generally reduces the effect of education on health but education retains a negative and significant relationship with all outcomes.  The research presented in this paper also raises questions about the effect of omitted individual heterogeneity in measuring the effects of public policy",

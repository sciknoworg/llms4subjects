            "abstract": "Human capital development is at the top of Indonesia's economic development agenda. The National Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPN 2005-2025) identifies human resource development as one of the key drivers of the eight national development goals to be achieved by 2025. As part of this push, the government of Indonesia has taken several steps to build a skilled and competitive workforce building on the country's demographic strengths, strategic position, and sustained economic growth. An important milestone was the launch in 2016 of a national initiative known as Revitalization of Secondary Vocational Schools, which the Ministry of Education and Culture has updated recently. This initiative focuses on strengthening the quality and relevance of secondary vocational schools. Chapter one proposes a framework for defining an advanced LMIS that includes stakeholders, functions, key elements, key characteristics, and essential features that go well beyond those of an online job-matching platform. Chapter two discusses the current state of Indonesia's AyoKitaKerja, which is the focus of the analysis, is the most developed LMIS function and is considered the building block of Indonesia's LMIS. Chapter two also presents Indonesia's LMIS-related initiatives in addition to AyoKitaKerja and introduces some comparison with LMISs in other countries. Chapter three focuses in more detail on the factors that are essential for building up the five key characteristics of a well-functioning LMIS. The analysis benchmarks AyoKitaKerja against Korea's Work-net in each of these areas, with a particular focus on the job-matching function. Finally, chapter four provides a vision and action plan for developing a comprehensive LMIS",

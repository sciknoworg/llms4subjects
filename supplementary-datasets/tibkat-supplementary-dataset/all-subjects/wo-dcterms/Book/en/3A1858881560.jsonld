            "abstract": "Build your hardware, electronics, and programming skills, and use them to realize your advanced robotics projects with this powerful platform Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free PDF eBook Key Features Become an expert in selecting sensors, motors, and Arduino boards for any robotics project Discover how to write effective and reusable code for your Arduino robotics projects Learn to build a camera-based line follower and a self-balancing telepresence robot on your own Book Description Every robot needs a \"brain,\" and the Arduino platform provides an incredibly accessible way to bring your Arduino robot to life. Anyone can easily learn to build and program their own robots with Arduino for hobby and commercial uses, making Arduino-based robots the popular choice for school projects, college courses, and the rapid prototyping of industrial applications! Practical Arduino Robotics is a comprehensive guide that equips you with the necessary skills and techniques that can be applied to various projects and applications, from automating repetitive tasks in a laboratory to building engaging mobile robots. Building on basic knowledge of programming and electronics, this book teaches you how to choose the right components, such as Arduino boards, sensors, and motors, and write effective code for your robotics project, including the use of advanced third-party Arduino libraries and interfaces, such as Analog, SPI, I2C, PWM, and UART. You'll also learn different ways to command your robots wirelessly, such as over Wi-Fi. Finally, with basic to advanced project examples, this book illustrates how to build exciting autonomous robots like a self-balancing telepresence robot. By the end of this book, you'll be able to design and create your own custom robots for a wide variety of applications. What you will learn Understand and use the various interfaces of an Arduino board Write the code to communicate with your sensors and motors Implement and tune methods for sensor signal processing Understand and implement state machines that control your robot Implement feedback control to create impressive robot capabilities Integrate hardware and software components into a reliable robotic system Tune, debug, and improve Arduino-based robots systematically Who this book is for If you're excited about robotics and want to start creating your own robotics projects from the hardware up, this book is for you. Whether you are an experienced software developer who wants to learn how to build physical robots, a hobbyist looking to elevate your Arduino skills to the next level, or a student with the desire to kick-start your DIY robotics journey, you'll find this book very useful. In order to successfully work with this book, you'll need basic familiarity with electronics, Arduino boards and the core concepts of computer programming",

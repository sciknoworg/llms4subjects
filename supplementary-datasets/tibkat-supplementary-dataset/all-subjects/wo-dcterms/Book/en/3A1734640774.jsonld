The book gathers invited reports from prestigious scholars in such research areas as political philosophy, economy, history, international security and diplomacy. The theme of the book is grand in nature, for the world is undergoing once-in-a-century great transformation, meanwhile China faces the critical moment for its great rejuvenation, how China thinks about and designs its relations with the world is a key issue in international the arena. The book reveals that the greatest challenge to China in this context is how to secure and extend its period of strategic opportunity, and actively shaping this period should be regarded as the core trend of its response. The aim of this book is threefold: firstly, to provide a comprehensive overview of the undergoing world transformation and its interaction with China; to analyze how China deals with internal and external challenges, why China could still have strategic opportunities and what will and should China do to sustain and reshape its period of strategic opportunity, secondly, to analyze how China deals with fierce strategic competition with the U.S., and how it develops its relations with other countries, especially great powers; to analyze the challenges that the BRI faces and how China reshapes it relations with other developing countries via cooperation on the BRI; thirdly, to provide a vivid picture of world transformation and China\u2019s design of its grand strategy, to investigate the key factors in securing China\u2019s sustainable development and its period of strategic opportunity, and indicates that the key is to develop a global vision and provide new strategic opportunities for the world, and the support comes from a stronger presence in the region and an optimized geopolitical and economic environment. The book provides Chinese visions and wisdom on world transformation and strategic opportunities, reveals Chinese wisdoms in dealing with transformation and crises, all readers could learn more if they could keep calm and think. ."

            "abstract": "A unique framework provides a unifying financial management theme throughout the text. At the beginning of each chapter, the relationship between the concepts in the chapter and the unifying theme is explored. This approach helps students keep an eye on the forest rather than getting lost in the trees.  A comprehensive case study at the end of the text summarises the major concepts addressed throughout the book and reflects the unifying theme. The last chapter focuses on well-known retail giant, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and shows how the concepts introduced in the book can be applied to assess Walmart s performance and to identify ways in which Walmart can create value for its shareholders.  In order to make sure students gain as much practical knowledge as possible, the text emphasises the applications of concepts. Examples relating to Home Depot, Inc., the world s largest home improvement retailer, are presented throughout. For example, after cost of capital is discussed, the text shows how to estimate Home Depot s cost of capital. Examples pertaining to other firms and situations are included where relevant. Much of this information is conveyed visually via charts, exhibits, and tables.  The text highlights the relevance of principles of finance to practicing managers, both in finance and in other areas. A summary section in each chapter highlights the relevance of the concepts and ideas presented, as well as the key takeaways for managers.   Foster thorough understanding via learning aids  A collection of learning tools throughout the text helps students stay on track:  Self-study questions in each chapter summarise the key concepts covered in the chapter.  Present value tables at the end of the book enable students to calculate values.  A glossary of key terms at the end of the text serves as a helpful reference for students as they work through the material",

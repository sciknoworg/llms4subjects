            "abstract": "This book is focused on quality management, and four different lenses which can be used to explore the phenomenon. It introduces emergence as a paradigm in thinking about quality, and explores conditions which are beneficial to radical innovation. The Emergence Paradigm in Quality Management provides an overview of the existing movements in thinking about quality, and discusses why these movements in fact represent paradigms. Three paradigms, the Empirical Paradigm, the Reference Paradigm and the Reflective Paradigm, are explained followed by a search for the Fourth Paradigm, the so-called Emergence Paradigm, which presents a route to radical innovation in organizations when plans, strategies and models fail. It presents the debates around the paradigms, and explores which is the best approach. This professional text will be ideal for strategy and policy makers wanting to establish a link between their conceived plans and the attention for quality, while finding ways to facilitate innovation. Professionals in a range of for-profit and non-profit organizations, including healthcare, will be able to expand their knowledge on quality management, operations management, and organizational studies.",

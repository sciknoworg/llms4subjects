Special attention is paid to the interactions between color as a quality of perception and the quality of cultural objectivations. Our \"eye knowledge\" of colors is created by dealing with traditional modes of perception and the meanings of things, images and behavioral patterns, myths, stereotypes and more, in short: with the objective culture. In this sense, \u201cobjective color\u201d is not a quality that is inherent in natural phenomena independently of humans. It is shaped by culture and, in turn, can shape culture. The \"World 3\" (Karl R. Popper) of color is therefore the focus of our interest, to which the papers in this volume want to contribute from various disciplinary perspectives. In addition to well-known and respected scholars from Germany, Austria and Sweden - in line with the profile of \u201cbricolage\u201d as a publication organ for young academics - young academics are also given the possibility to publish their first texts",

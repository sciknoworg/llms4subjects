            "abstract": "A concise primer that complicates a convenient truth in biology\u2014the divide between germ and somatic cells\u2014with far-reaching ethical and public policy ramifications.   Scientists have long held that we have two kinds of cells\u2014germ and soma. Make a change to germ cells\u2014say using genome editing\u2014and that change will appear in the cells of future generations. Somatic cells are \u201csafe\u201d after such tampering; modify your skin cells, and your future children\u2019s skin cells will never know. And, while germ cells can give rise to new generations (including all of the somatic cells in a body), somatic cells can never become germ cells. How did scientists discover this relationship and distinction between somatic and germ cells\u2014the so-called Weismann Barrier\u2014and does it actually exist? Can somatic cells become germ cells in the way germ cells become somatic cells? That is, can germ cells regenerate from somatic cells even though conventional wisdom denies this possibility? Covering research from the late nineteenth century to the 2020s, historian and philosopher of science Kate MacCord explores how scientists came to understand and accept the dubious concept of the Weismann Barrier and what profound implications this convenient assumption has for research and policy, from genome editing to stem cell research, and much more",

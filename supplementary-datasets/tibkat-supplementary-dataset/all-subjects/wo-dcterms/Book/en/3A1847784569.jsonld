            "abstract": "\"A Hands-On Course in Sensors using the Arduino and Raspberry Pi is the first book to give a practical and wide-ranging account of how to interface sensors and actuators with micro-controllers, Raspberry Pi and other control systems. The author describes the progression of raw signals through conditioning stages, digitization, data storage and presentation. The collection, processing, and understanding of sensor data plays a central role in industrial and scientific activities. This book builds simplified models of large industrial or scientific installations that contain hardware and other building blocks, including services for databases, web servers, control systems, and messaging brokers. A range of case studies are included within the book, including a weather station, ground-vibration measurements, impedance measurements, interfacing medical sensors to web browsers, the profile of a laser beam, and a remote-controlled and fire-seeking robot. This second edition has been updated throughout to reflect new hardware and software releases since the book was first published. Newly added features include the ESP32 microcontroller, several environmental and medical sensors, actuators for signal generation, as well as a chapter on websockets; all illustrated in new case studies. This book is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students taking hands-on laboratory courses in physics and engineering. Hobbyists in robotics clubs and other enthusiasts will also find this book of interest\"--",

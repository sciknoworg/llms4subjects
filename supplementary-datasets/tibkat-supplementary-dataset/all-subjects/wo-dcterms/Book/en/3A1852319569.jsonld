            "abstract": "An important component of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), the flagship conditional cash transfer (CCT) program of the Philippines, is the delivery of complementary services such as Family Development Sessions (FDS) and Youth Development Sessions (YDS) to program beneficiaries. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these were regular face-to-face sessions providing practical information on topics such as parenting, early childhood care, and disaster preparedness to adult beneficiaries and guidance on adolescent dynamics to young children in 4Ps households, with the overall aim of promoting positive behavioral changes. This technical note examines the process undertaken to enhance and align the content of the FDS and YDS based on the 4Ps law that mandates a maximum 7-year operational period, and it discusses feedback and insights from beneficiaries and implementers. Moreover, it considers the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns, which have led to mobility restrictions among beneficiaries and implementers since March 2020. Due to the pandemic, the delivery of FDS have relied mostly on broadcast and social media platforms, with options for small group neighborhood sessions in areas with low rates of COVID-19 infections, while YDS have been mostly suspended due to school closures nationwide, without in-person gathering. For a more effective delivery of these learning sessions, this policy note proposes key recommendations on adapting to future shocks and emerging beneficiary needs, developing strategic communications, mobilizing resources, strengthening monitoring and evaluation, and connecting to core values. In particular, it proposes regular updating of module content to maintain relevance and applicability, strengthening alternative modes of program delivery to increase coverage, providing training to facilitators to improve capacity, raising awareness to increase program uptake, creating a clear monitoring and evaluation system to track progress, leveraging the use of technology, and providing post-program exit support to sustain positive behavioral changes among beneficiaries",

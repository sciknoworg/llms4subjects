The volume truly excels as both a source on comparative European foreign policy and empirically well-informed theory on the sources of foreign policy change.\u201d \u2014Joe D. Hagan, Barnette Professor, Department of Political Science, West Virginia University, USA In the past three decades, the world has witnessed many rapid and invasive changes, and seems to be changing countries have adapted their foreign policies to these changes. Building on a clear typology of foreign policy change and a consistent theoretical framework, this book offers a comparative analysis of for\u00adeign policy change in Europe throughout the post-Cold War period. Along the lines of our analytical framework, country experts discuss how and why the fur\u00adther ever more rapidly in ways that seemed only imaginable in movies. This book investigates how European foreign policies of eleven European countries have changed over the past thirty years. This book hereby advances our understanding of the phenomenon of foreign policy change and identifies the most important drivers and inhibitors of change. Jeroen K.

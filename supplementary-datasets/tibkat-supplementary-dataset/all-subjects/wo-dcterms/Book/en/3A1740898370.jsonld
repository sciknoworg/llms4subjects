            "abstract": "Some new aspects of the physics and chemistry of oxides are considered in this book. Typical examples are the non-stoichiometry of oxides and the structure and physical properties of High-Tc Superconductors. In both cases, some very new aspects of these domains are treated, and phase transitions are accorded their full importance in understanding so many of the physical properties of oxides. This third volume continues the series which began with \"Diffusionless Phase Transitions and Related Structures in Oxides\" and \"Diffusionless Phase Transitions in Oxides\"; both the work of the same editor. As in the two first volumes, great effort has been made to provide a simple presentation of the latest information. Current and potential, applications are never forgotten as this is a domain which is continually expanding. Every effort has been made to explain fully the most recent results in the field, while remaining easily understandable.1. Experimental Techniques. 2. Phase Transitions and Related Phenomena. 3. Non Stoichiometry. 4. Superconductors. Contains 14 papers explaining the latest advances in the physics and chemistry of oxides, in sections on experimental techniques, phase transitions and related phenomena, non-stoichiometry, and superconductors. Specific subjects include ESR and NMR in non- conducting solids, oxide-ion and protonic solid electrolytes, anion- deficient fluorite-related oxides of the higher rare earths, and phase transitions in multiphase composites. An effort has been made to present research in a readable fashion",

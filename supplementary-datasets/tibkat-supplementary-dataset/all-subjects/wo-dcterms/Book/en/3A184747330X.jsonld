                "Gain a thorough understanding of DevOps concepts and learn to deploy AWS DevOps services in an organization. This book covers AWS DevOps deployment and building applications and services for enhanced performance. A Complete Guide to DevOps with AWS will show you how to use AWS DevOps to launch and scale services using AWS tools. It demonstrates how to handle infrastructure as code such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeArtifact, and how to adapt your software with familiar tools such as terraform and cloud formation. This practice also helps in the continuous integration and deployment of pipelines such as AWS CodeDeploy and AWS CodePipeline with different deployment strategies. You will also learn how to find bugs quicker, enhance software quality, reduce your time to market, and how to build, test, and prepare for a release with frequent code changes. You will also see how to scale your applications to provide maximum performance for users with high traffic. The book also covers monitoring and logging applications, giving an overall picture of the ecosystem of product development. It also explains Kubernetes in depth with AWS EKS. It concludes by walking you through how to build projects with AWS DevOps tools and technologies. After completing this book, you will have gained a solid understanding of the concepts of AWS DevOps through examples, including building projects with integration of software tools. You will: Automate processes with AWS tools Understand AWS Services for Continuous deployment, and how to use them Use infrastructure as code with AWS in different formats Integrate AWS security into DevOps."

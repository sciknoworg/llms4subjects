            "abstract": "The Nazi 1933 Civil Service Law and the 1935 Nuremberg Laws are often considered the first anti-Jewish decrees in interwar Europe. M\u00e1ria M. Kov\u00e1cs convincingly argues that Hungary\u2019s numerus clausus law of 1920, which introduced a Jewish quota at Hungary\u2019s institutions of higher learning, was, in fact, interwar Europe\u2019s first antisemitic law. By defining\u2014and discriminating against\u2014Jews as a separate \u201cracial\u201d or \u201cnational\u201d group, it abrogated the principle of equal rights that had been enshrined into law; as such, it marked an abrupt reversal of Jewish emancipation in Hungary. Moreover, the numerus clausus law set the stage for subsequent \u201cJewish Laws\u201d (in the late 1930s and early 1940s) that sought to solve Hungary\u2019s \u201cJewish Question\u201d by means of extraordinary legal measures that targeted Jews alone. This book examines the origins and implementation of the numerus clausus, as well as the attempts to dampen its impact on Hungary\u2019s international reputation, focusing on the debates surrounding it promulgation (1920), its modification (1928) and its eventual application to other areas of Jewish life (1938\u201345)",

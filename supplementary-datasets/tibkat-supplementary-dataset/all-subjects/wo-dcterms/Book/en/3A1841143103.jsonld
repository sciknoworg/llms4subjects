            "abstract": "Thinking with an Accent casts accent as a powerfully coded yet underexplored mode of perception shaping our global cultural economy. Theorizing accent as a mediatized object, an interdisciplinary method, and an embodied practice, this volume invites readers to think with an accent\u2014to practice a dialogical, multisensorial inquiry that can yield transformative modalities of knowledge, action, and care. \u201cThere is no such thing as a voice without an accent, yet theories of voice still treat accents as the exception. Thinking with an Accent teaches us how to begin from accented voices and provides a panoply of tools for imagining, working with, building on, analyzing, and desiring accents.\u201d \u2014 JONATHAN STERNE, author of Diminished Faculties: A Political Phenomenology of Impairment \u201cThis creative and ambitious collection encourages us to reconsider our own accented lives and how they structure our social, digital, and literary worlds. An essential book.\u201d \u2014 DOLORES IN\u00c9S CASILLAS, author of Sounds of Belonging: U.S. Spanish-Language Radio and Public Advocacy \u201cThis book teaches us that the accent must be understood not as an ontological reality but as a co-constituted happening. The result is that accent becomes something to think with, not just to study. Straightforward, well argued, and a pleasure to read.\u201d \u2014 KAREEM KHUBCHANDANI, author of Ishtyle: Accenting Gay Indian Nightlife\"",

            "abstract": "The book has 15 chapters. Chapter 1 introduces personalization and seeks not only to dispel the misunderstandings about what it can do, but also to highlight the opportunities it can bring across a wide range of services, but also highlights the need for privacy controls and the platform intelligence required to deliver real benefit to the user. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the location and positioning systems that are enabling location-based services to be delivered now and into the future. The scenario of safety and security is explored in greater detail in Chapter 3. The impact and importance of standards in the mobile arena is outlined in Chapter 4. Returning to usage of personal information, including location in a user profile, chapter 5 discusses the major industry technologies - W3C P3P, Microsoft Net, and the Liberty Alliance. The topic of user profiles is extended in Chapter 6, where service personalization is discussed in the context of mobility. Chapter 7 examines the techniques that form the armoury of the knowledge management tool-kit. Chapter 8 addresses this subject and explains the options available to determine key characteristics of the connecting client. The display of content is extended within Chapter 9, which looks at European and Far Eastern languages and their machine-based translation. The topic of content creation and its formatting is tackled in Chapter 10. Using distributed profile information for on-line advertising is the subject presented in the first of these two chapters, Chapter 11. Chapter 12 describes the implementation of a workflow and collaboration middleware platform named Pl@za, which demonstrates this ability. Chapter 13 covers the integration of location information to deliver business advantage and tackles corporate applications as these have proved to be the most significant business cases for deployment. The use of intelligent agents deployed in a location-based support system for a closed user group is the topic of the second case study, in Chapter 14. In conclusion, Chapter 15 provides the final word on the use of personalisation in the relationship with the most important element in the system - the customer",

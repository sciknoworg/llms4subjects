            "abstract": "\"There is an increasing demand for healthier and safer food among consumers in recent years and both industry and academia are developing novel food preservation methods. As it happens in other sectors, revisiting traditional strategies in combination with modern technologies results in higher effectivity and better acceptance by the consumers. In the case of food preservation, this translates into increased investigation and applicability of elements such as protective cultures, including the use of bacteria, virus and yeasts, and their by-products to control undesired microorganisms. The effect of some of these bioactive compounds is well characterised, as lactic acid. However, other compounds such as antimicrobial peptides or phage therapy are still yet to be fully exploited. Here, we offer a comprehensive summary of the different biopreservation techniques applied to the different food groups, providing an overview of novel approaches and strategies that are already available in the market\"--",

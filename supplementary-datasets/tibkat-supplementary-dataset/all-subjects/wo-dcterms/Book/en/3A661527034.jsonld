Distance and borders are two important reasons for this bias and are a powerful deterrent to globalization. Also, multinational corporations the organizations that best symbolize the concept of globalization do not have a global reach, but rather focus their activities within an area surrounding the home market.

This volume explores the drivers of cross-border trade and the forces underlying the expansion of the border from the nation to the regional trade area.

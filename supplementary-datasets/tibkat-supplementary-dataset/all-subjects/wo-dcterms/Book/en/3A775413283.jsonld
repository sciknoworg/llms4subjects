                "The present volume entitled \"Recent Contributions to Fluid Mechanics\" is dedicated to Professor Dr.-Ing. Alfred Walz in honour of his 75th birthday. Alfred Walz, born on 11 May 1907, began his outstanding career as an electrical engineer. A few years after obtaining his university\u00ad degree he became extremely engaged in fluid dynamics. Walking in the footsteps of Prandtl he was able to direct the development of theoretical activities in an inimitable way. He had the great opportunity to work both as an engaged fluid dynamicist -always trying to get to the bottom of things -and as a popular and patient teacher. To all of these things - in his own words - he gave his heart. Consequently, it is a great pleasure to publish the following 34 contributions summarizing the efforts of 56 authors. These artic\u00ad les in total cover the wide range of experimental as well as theore\u00ad tical fluid dynamics and reflect the present state of the art. Moreover, all colleagues and friends of Alfred Walz wish that he may be able to continue his work and his influence on the work of all of us via his enlightening ideas.

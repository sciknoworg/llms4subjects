                "About 80 participants from 16 countries attended the Conference on Numerical Methods for Free Boundary Problems, held at the University of Jyviiskylii, Finland, July 23-27, 1990. The main purpose of this conference was to provide up-to-date information on important directions of research in the field of free boundary problems and their numerical solutions. The contributions contained in this volume cover the lectures given in the conference. The invited lectures were given by H.W. Alt, V. Barbu, K-H. Hoffmann, H. Mittelmann and V. Rivkind. In his lecture H.W. Alt considered a mathematical model and existence theory for non-isothermal phase separations in binary systems. The lecture of V. Barbu was on the approximate solvability of the inverse one phase Stefan problem. K-H. Hoff\u00ad mann gave an up-to-date survey of several directions in free boundary problems and listed several applications, but the material of his lecture is not included in this proceedings. H.D. Mittelmann handled the stability of thermo capillary convection in float-zone crystal growth. V. Rivkind considered numerical methods for solving coupled Navier-Stokes and Stefan equations. Besides of those invited lectures mentioned above there were 37 contributed papers presented. We shall briefly outline the topics of the contributed papers: Stefan like problems. Modelling, existence and uniqueness.",

            "abstract": "To further develop and finalize the Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs) for scaling up to the Bank's entire fisheries portfolio, a number of specific pilots and case studies have been conducted. This report provides an overview of the FPIs, and a summary of two case studies in its application, the blue swimming crab (BSC) fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines. A comparative analysis with an Icelandic lobster fishery is conducted as a benchmark, as the Icelandic lobster fishery is also export oriented and has been recognized as a well-managed fishery. The study is organized as follows: chapter two provides a brief introduction of FPIs and the blue swimming fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines. Chapter three presents the results for FPIs that measure the success ('outputs') in achieving the 'triple bottom line' of environmental, social, and economic sustainability and provides a critical evaluation of strengths, weaknesses, and omissions of the current FPIs design. Chapter four presents the results for FPIs that measure factors ('inputs') that enable (or undermine) the likelihood that the triple bottom line will be achieved and provides a critical evaluation of strengths, weaknesses, and omissions of the current FPIs design chapter five summarizes the results and draws conclusions about the applicability of FPIs and next steps. Five appendices provide supplementary information. Appendix A provides detailed explanation of the rationale and measurement for each indicator. Appendix B lists additional suggested indicators based on the case studies. Appendix C lists the participants who have attended the workshops in London and Hawaii. Appendixes D and E illustrate the FPIs' output and input results for the studied fisheries, respectively",

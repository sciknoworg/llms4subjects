            "abstract": "\"Networks are pervasive. Very large scale integrated (VLSI) systems are no different, consisting of dozens of interconnected subsystems, hundreds of modules, and many billions of transistors and wires. Graph theory is crucial for managing and analyzing these systems. In this book, VLSI system design is discussed from the perspective of graph theory. Starting from theoretical foundations, the authors uncover the link connecting pure mathematics with practical product development. This book not only provides a review of established graph theoretic practices, but also discusses the latest advancements in graph theory driving modern VLSI technologies, covering a wide range of design issues such as synchronization, power network models and analysis, and interconnect routing and synthesis. Provides a practical introduction to graph theory in the context of VLSI systems engineering; Reviews comprehensively graph theoretic methods and algorithms commonly used during VLSI product development process; Includes a review of novel graph theoretic methods and algorithms for VLSI system design.\"--Back cover",

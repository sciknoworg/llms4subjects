                "Anyone interested in ALS/MND\u2014physician, patient, or healthcare policy director \u2014should read this book and learn from it. \u2014Walter G. Bradley D.M., F.R.C.P., Professor and Chairman Emeritus, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, USA \u201cThis book illustrates the inequities in the accessibility of quality neurological care existing globally and which forms a major target for redress by the World Federation of Neurology and the World Health Organisation.\u201d \u2014William M Carroll AM, MBBS, MD, FRACP, FRCP(E), President, World Federation of Neurology This book focuses on the public policy and political/ethical dimensions of ALS/MND across a wide selection of countries and argues for the need of a multidisciplinary and international approach. Policy issues addressed include adequacy of funding for research and care, payment policy and regulatory functions of public and private insurers, long-term services and caregiver support, public health and prevention efforts, access to genetic testing and assisted technologies, ensuring a competent and adequate workforce especially for hands-on caregivers, and the challenging issues of providing palliative and hospice care for ALS/MND patients, advance directives and assisted suicide that face policy makers in all political jurisdictions.

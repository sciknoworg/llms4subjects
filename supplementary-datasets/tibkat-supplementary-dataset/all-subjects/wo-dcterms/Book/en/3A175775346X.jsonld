                "Influenced by technological innovation, banks and their businesses are changing dramatically. This book explores the transformation and prospects of financial market institutions (banks, insurance companies, pension funds and microfinance organizations) in the context of the development of financial innovation, financial engineering and financial technologies, taking into account risks and new opportunities for development. It presents new approaches to the sustainable development of financial and credit institutions, taking into account the risk management and crisis management of their activities in the macro and microeconomic environment. Contributors from Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Ireland and Italy present their expert opinions on the practice of financial intermediaries in the conditions of economic transformation under the influence of the 4th Industrial Revolution and the Covid-19 pandemic. This book includes some of the key debates in this area including the genesis of financial markets in the paradigm of economic digitalization, the evolution of financial intermediaries from the classical model to the ecosystem, and the regulation of neo-banks. The book will be of interest to academics and practitioners in various spheres of theoretical and empirical knowledge, including economics, finance and banking, who are interested in investigation of the complex of fundamental (international and domestic) trends in the development of financial intermediation in the globalized financial markets.",

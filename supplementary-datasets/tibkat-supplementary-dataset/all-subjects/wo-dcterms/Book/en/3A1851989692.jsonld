The book shows how encapsulation methods and plant-based materials may be used in a variety of ways. The first section, Encapsulation Technologies, delves into the concepts, advantages, and techniques for encapsulating bioactives based on cereals, spices, and coffee. It also discusses the role of nanoliposomes for encapsulation of natural foods. The second section, Functional Aspects of Plant-Based Foods, discusses functional aspects of plant-based foods, nutraceutical-based functional food design, diverse functional food items, functional aspects of food, and the role of functional components. The third section, Health Benefits of Plant-Based Foods, covers selected plants (such as cereals, pepper, and coffee) and their chief phytochemicals and bioactive compounds along with their health benefits. The fourth section, Safety Aspects of Functional and Natural Foods, examines the role of functional foods in food safety and provides an overview of industrial food safety issues and techniques for monitoring food quality and safety. This volume will act as reference book for researchers, scientists, students, and food processors, providing a wealth of knowledge on encapsulation processes and their applications, functional foods, and food safety issues\"--",

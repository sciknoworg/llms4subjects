            "abstract": "Women\u2019s sports have received much less attention from economists than from other social scientists. This Handbook fills that gap with a comprehensive economic analysis of women\u2019s sports. It also analyzes how the behavior and treatment of female athletes reflect broad economic forces. -- Contributors to this volume use current theoretical models and econometric tools to examine the legal, social, and economic forces that affect the experiences of female athletes. They address such traditional topics as discrimination against female athletes and coaches and the effect of athletic events on the economies of host countries. They also apply theory and estimation to new settings, such as how women respond to tournaments in skiing and figure skating or how the growing dominance of Korean women on the LPGA tour is a form of immigration. -- Leeds and Leeds have filled a gaping hole in sports economics with this revealing collection of essays. The economics of women in sports has been too long neglected. By covering everything from women as sports spectators, to women as participants in individual and team sports at the collegiate and professional levels, to women\u2019s sports internationally, Title IX, and women\u2019s differential response to incentives, this volume not only demonstrates that there is much fertile ground to be studied, but also that the subject matter is both interesting and important.'

            "abstract": "This comparative study examines the emergence and political significance of lunatics\u2019 rights activism in Europe between 1870 and 1920. In writing the history of the criticism of psychiatry, scholars have so far mainly focused on the second half of the twentieth century. This chapter, however, shows that the decades around 1900 already saw a widespread criticism \u2018from below\u2019 accompanying the professionalisation and modernisation of European psychiatry. The comparative analysis of the careers of two key campaign leaders, Louisa Lowe (1820\u20131901) in England and Adolf Gl\u00f6klen (1861\u2013c.1935) in Germany, reveals the similarities and differences in their motives, ways of campaigning, mobilisation success and political agency at the individual and collective level. Drawing on concepts from the political sociology of social movements and disability history, the chapter highlights the connections between early lunatics\u2019 rights activism and socio-historical categories like \u2018class\u2019, \u2018gender\u2019 and \u2018body\u2019 and identifies these campaigns as political predecessors of the contemporary consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement",

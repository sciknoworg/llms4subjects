                "This volume sheds light on the world of organizational politics, political leadership, and the pivotal roles played by employees and political leaders in managing diverse groups. It picks up where influential scholars like Edgar Schein, Harry Triandis, Bernard Bass, Robert House, Shalom Schwartz, and Geert Hofstede left off, providing a timely and transparent exploration of these crucial topics. In a rapidly evolving landscape, characterized by renewed interest in political skill, people management, leadership and management, diversity training, organizational culture, workplace incivility, ambivalence alliance, and career development, the book emerges as an invaluable resource, assembling a group of renowned contributors in the field, who have conducted extensive social research. It offers a comprehensive view of contemporary organizational politics, psychology at work, DEI, political skill/will, HRM, leadership effectiveness, organizational behavior and culture, relationships in the workplace and emotions in politics, favoritism, workplace incivility, ambivalent alliance, people analytics, and office politics, and competition. The book discusses the ongoing struggle between knowledge-driven scholarship and dogmatic ideology in the workplace and beyond. As organizations grapple with the challenges of today's business environment, the book therefore is an indispensable guide for scholars, consultants, and leaders committed to driving continuous improvement and navigating the complex intersection of politics and leadership in the modern workplace."

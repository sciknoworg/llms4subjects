                "The University of Genoa - Ohio State University Joint Conference on New Trends in Systems Theory was held at the Badia di S. Andrea in Genoa on July 9-11, 1990. This Proceedings volume contains articles based on two of the three Plenary talks and most of the shorter presentations. The papers are arranged by author, and no attempt has been made to organize them by topic. We would like to thank the members of the Scientific Committee and of the Program Committee, the speakers and authors, and everyone who attended the conference. Approximately 120 researchers and students from all over the world visited Genoa for the meeting, representing a wide spectrum of areas in pure and applied control and systems theory. The success of the conference depended on their high level of scientific and engineering expertise, not to mention their enthusiasm. The Conference on New Trends in Systems Theory would not have been possible without the help of a great many institutions and people. We would like to thank the University of Genoa, particularly Professor Enrico Beltrametti, and the Ohio State University's Columbian Quincentenary Committee led by Professor Christian Zacher, for encouragement and financial assistance. The University of Genoa Mathematics Department and Communication, Computer and System Sciences Department supplied assistance and technical help. The staff of the Consorzio Genova Ricerche, particularly Ms. Piera Ponta and Ms. Camilla Marconi, worked diligently over many months and especially during the conference itself to insure a smooth and enjoyable meeting.",

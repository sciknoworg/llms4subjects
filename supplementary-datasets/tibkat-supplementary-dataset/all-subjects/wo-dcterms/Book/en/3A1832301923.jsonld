            "abstract": "The authors will present a comprehensive account of the neurological aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim is to provide a practical clinical book which will serve as a guide for clinicians from all specialties involved in the management of COVID-19 patients. The authors share the extensive clinical experience gained in major hospitals in Lombardy, the first European region to face the COVID-19 emergency in 2020. All are recognized international experts in their respective fields and have been involved in the management of COVID-19 cases from the very beginning of the Italian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The text begins with a description of pathobiological and pathophysiological aspects related to the involvement of the nervous system, moving on to the discussion of the neurological complications observed in COVID-19 patients; these range from central to peripheral symptoms, and can occur in the acute or post-acute phases of the disease. Further topics are: neuropathology, seizures and EEG, neuroimaging, delirium, encephalomyelitis, stroke, psychopathology and psychiatry, neuropsychology and cognitive impairment, neuromuscu-lar disorders, and the impact of COVID-19 on other pre-existing neurological disorders. In addi-tion, the book will discuss the new developments in teleneurology approaches, which have been a direct response to the ongoing pandemic. Finally, the possible neurological complications of the COVID-19 vaccines and the neurological complications in children will be considered.Each chapter will present a critical review of the existing literature concerning the specific subject matter, followed by practical clinical recommendations, as well as personal considerations based on the experience gained by each author during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Neurology of COVID-19 will be an original and innovative reference book for clinicians of all the specialties involved in the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection",

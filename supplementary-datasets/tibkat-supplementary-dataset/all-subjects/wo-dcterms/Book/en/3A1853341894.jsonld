            "abstract": "Distant reading, an empirical and quantitative approach in literary studies proposed by Franco Moretti, has raised a lively debate and attracted criticisms from \"traditional literary scholars.\" An important reason behind these criticisms is the need for solid theoretical foundations: distant reading is perhaps the first methodology in literary studies that do not include a specific theory of literature, an ontology of the literary. Much of the work in the field derives its theoretical frameworks from the literary theories of the twentieth-century tradition, based on the assumption that literary texts can be understood through reading and interpretation. A large-scale quantitative approach to literary and cultural phenomena is mainly incompatible with \"the hermeneutic attitude\" and traditional theories. Therefore, I propose a convergence with cognitive and bio-evolutionary approaches to literature and studies of cultural evolution and a shift from \"interpretation\" to \"explanation\" as the goal of computational literary studies",

            "abstract": "Generating quality jobs is a major concern of policy makers around the world who want to ensure sustainable growth and social cohesion. This concern has led to greater interest in supporting the social and solidarity economy (SSE). The SSE focuses on supporting productive structures managed by the producers themselves and brings together multiple actors to improve economic and social welfare. These actors include small producers, producers' cooperatives, and nongovernmental organizations, among others. SSE structures can operate in all economic sectors, but they typically operate in labor-intensive sectors. The SSE sector has been very dynamic in recent years, growing faster than the rest of the economy in many countries and providing flexible forms of employment that give workers more power to decide how to organize their jobs. This paper reviews financial solutions, also referred to as products, that were developed by private and public financial institutions to support the SSE. The purpose of this review is to draw lessons and insights for development banks that are also considering developing these products to support the SSE. As development banks increasingly align their activities with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is greater interest in products that support the SSE",

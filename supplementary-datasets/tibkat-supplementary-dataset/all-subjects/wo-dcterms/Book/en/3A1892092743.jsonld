                "This book provides unique insight into economic development within the ASEAN region and its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. With a particular focus on Indonesia, it highlights the historic importance of manufacturing within the region and how the sector remains vital, despite the Asian financial crisis, and central to sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The growing influence of digital technologies, including remote work, online services, and digital marketplaces, are highlighted, particularly in relation to economic mitigation and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Broader issues, such as FDI, human development, regional integration, R&D spillovers, labour productivity, and bilateral trade, are also discussed. This book highlights how ASEAN economies can be strengthened by innovation, trade, and increased productivity. It will be relevant to students and researchers interested in development and international economics. Fithra Faisal Hastiadi is a researcher at the University of Indonesia and Executive Director at Next Policy."

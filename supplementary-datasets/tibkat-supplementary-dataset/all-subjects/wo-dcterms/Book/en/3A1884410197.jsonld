            "abstract": "\"This book offers a complete coverage of microbial refinery for exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, including genetic improvements, production techniques, biotechnological applications in food, cosmetics, health and environment sector, economic perspectives, and commercialization of EPS products. It focuses on exopolysaccharides production from an organism perspective to offer a complete picture from isolation of microbes to commercialization of EPS-based products. It covers strategies for EPS production and future perspectives and potential of microbial refinery. The book provides a concise introduction to the science, biology, technology, and application of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and details upstream, downstream steps in EPS production from microbial resources. It acts as a complete guide form production to commercialization and explores the potential application of EPS for socioeconomical benefits. It also discuss the EPS applications in food, cosmetics, health, and bioremediation approach for clean and sustainable development. This book is aimed at researchers and graduate students in fermentation technology, biochemical engineering, and biotechnology\"--",

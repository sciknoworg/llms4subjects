            "abstract": "Surgical and medical oncologists have been unable to decrease renal cell carcinoma mortality for uncertain reasons, although a lot of progress has been made in diagnosis and imaging, recognition of different genetic and pathological entities, management of localized disease and in the research on new drug treatments for advanced stages of the disease, potentially combined with surgery. The purpose of this book, which tackles a number of separate interesting topics, is to provide further insight into the disease and the management of early and advanced renal cell carcinoma. The volume is divided into different parts; the first part covers the characterization of renal masses and the second part covers rare distinct pathological entity. In the management section, active surveillance, partial nephrectomy and radiofrequency ablation are presented. A separate chapter reviews the management of Von Hippel Lindau disease, and finally, conventional and aberrant signaling pathways are explored",

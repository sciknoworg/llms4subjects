            "title": "<i>Salmonella</i> : Perspectives for Low-Cost Prevention, Control and Treatment",
            "abstract": "Salmonella is a Gram-negative bacterium and a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family that causes infections in humans and animals, making it one of the most common causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Since its discovery in the late 1800s, significant progress has been made in the understanding of its genetics, classification, pathogenesis, detection, prevention, control, and treatment. Numerous reviews and chapters on Salmonella have been published, but some gaps remain to be addressed. This book includes seven chapters that focus on the low-cost prevention, control, and treatment of salmonellosis in developing countries. It begins with a brief review of Salmonella, followed by chapters on the transmission of the organism in food and companion animals relevant to the One Health approach, CRISPR-Cas systems in Salmonella for pathogen typing in diagnosis and surveillance, the low-cost control of Salmonella using solar disinfection of water in resource-limiting communities, and transmission and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Salmonella across the One Health sector. This book also introduces a new concept of AMR reversal using traditional Chinese medicine. The information provided in this book will encourage Salmonella researchers, medical professionals, and students to further enhance their own research and education as well as encourage new researchers to include Salmonella in their future research initiatives",

            "abstract": "The use of concentrated solar technologies has grown significantly worldwide in the last decade but the research and development of this renewable energy technology still needs to be advanced to guarantee its competitiveness with other energy sources. Challenges remain with reducing costs, optimizing the systems design, and increasing the performance and durability of the systems.This Special Issue on research on solar collectors presents some recent developments and studies on tracking-solar collectors for medium- to high-temperature applications, both line- and point-focus systems, conceived for the supply of heat in industrial processes, to provide thermal energy to a power block for electricity production, or even to combine heat and electricity generation in a solar collector unit (CPV/T). The articles included in this Special Issue cover theoretical or practical issues on geometrics optics, thermal\u2013hydraulic modelling, and performance analysis, focusing on the following topics:\u2022 Solar towers: heliostat fields analysis and optimization\u2022 Solar towers: heat transfer media studies\u2022 Parabolic troughs: evacuated solar receivers analysis and thermal\u2013hydraulic modelling\u2022 Fresnel reflectors: geometrics optics and manufacturing issues\u2022 Fresnel lens in CPV\u2022 Energy losses in solar collectors systems",

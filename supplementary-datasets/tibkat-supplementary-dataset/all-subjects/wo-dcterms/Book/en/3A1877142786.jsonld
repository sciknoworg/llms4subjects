                "Learn the essentials of the Unity game engine, the C# programming language, and the art of object-oriented programming. This book is aimed at beginners with no knowledge or experience in game development or programming. Packed with examples, this Second Edition is up-to-date with the latest Unity standards and features as of 2023, and includes many adjustments to improve your experience. Starting with an introduction to Unity, you will learn the essentials of the engine: navigating the various windows, managing the objects that make up your game, and understanding the concepts that are fundamental to the engine. After that, you will gain a solid foundation in the concepts of object-oriented programming and the syntax of the C# language. Then the fun really begins, as you get hands-on experience building three playable example projects that drill you on the concepts you\u2019ve learned until they stick. Guided at each step by author Casey Hardman, you will outline and implement bare-bones, simple games designed to exercise your development skills: a top-down obstacle course, a tower defense game, and a 3D playground that demonstrates Unity's physics features. As you progress through the book, you'll put to use more and more of the features of C# and Unity, adding tools to your belt and strengthening you as a game developer. By the time you\u2019ve completed the book, you will be empowered to strike out on your own and build the game mechanics of your choice. You will: Understand the fundamentals of object-oriented computer programming and the C# programming language Leverage the features of Unity to implement game mechanics with reusable, clean, and elegant code Design and implement your own mechanics and independently solve problems as they arise.",

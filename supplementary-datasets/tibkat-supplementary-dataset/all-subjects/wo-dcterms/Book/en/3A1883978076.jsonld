            "abstract": "This paper uses the context of the Islamic Republic of Iran-Iraq war in 1980-88 to study the long-term impacts of exposure to the war during school years on educational attainment and labor market outcomes in Iraq. The analysis uses an event study and the Iraq Household Socio-Economic Surveys 2006-2007. The findings show that the Islamic Republic of Iran-Iraq conflict had a negative impact on the social welfare of men who were exposed to the war, including on social security, pension plan, health care, paid leave, and job permanence, while little impact on women is found. Additionally, the conflict reduced wages for both men and women. Furthermore, men who were exposed to the conflict were more likely to work in dangerous jobs or without air conditioning, while no evidence on this is found for women. The paper also shows the impact of the intensity of the Islamic Republic of Iran-Iraq war on educational attainment and labor market outcomes. It documents the education channel through which the war affects labor market outcomes, showing that the war decreased the educational levels of men and women born between 1971 and 1981. The findings are robust to a variety of robustness checks and falsification tests",

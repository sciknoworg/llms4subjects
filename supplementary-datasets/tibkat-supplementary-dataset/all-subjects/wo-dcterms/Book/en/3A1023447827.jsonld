                "'The digital economy has spurred a burgeoning literature in economics, marketing and strategy. Recent innovations led to the design of new markets with unparalleled data availability and targeted customization. This collection offers an outstanding reference for scholars and data-driven practitioners who wish to understand the subtleties of this new economy.'--Steve Tadelis, UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, US. 'Computers and held held devices are having a profound economic impact, whether in corporate suites or the home. The papers collected in this volume include some of the most important works assessing the consequences of these changes for both businesses and public policy.'--Josh Lerner, Harvard Business School, US. The increasing creation, support, use and consumption of digital representation of information touches a wide breadth of economic activities. This digitization has transformed social interactions, facilitated entirely new industries and undermined others and reshaped the ability of people - consumers, job seekers, managers, government officials and citizens - to access and leverage information. This important book includes seminal papers addressing topics such as the causes and consequences of digitization, factors shaping the structure of products and services and creating an enormous range of new applications and how market participants make their choices over strategic organization, market conduct, and public policies. This authoritative collection, with an original introduction by the editors, will be an invaluable source of reference for students, academics and practitioners with an interest in the economics of digitisation and the digital economy",

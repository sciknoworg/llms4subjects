                "Shear thickening fluid (STF) is a smart material that has been widely used in engineering applications over the last two decades. Its smart behavior, including adaptive viscosity, has found use in many engineering fields. This book provides an introduction to STF and smart systems, presenting cutting-edge technology and offering various case studies and research. It examines how conventional structures or systems can gain smart properties with the integration of STF, such as in magnetorheological materials, energy harvesting applications, battery electrolytes, vibration-damping systems, and surface polishing operations. Smart Systems with Shear Thickening Fluid is an essential resource for anyone working with STFs, and engineers, researchers, and scientists will gain valuable insights into its behavior and how it can be used to tailor rheology for smart applications. Includes research data and case studies; Offers thorough and up-to-date coverage of the use of smart thickening fluid in engineering applications; Covers the smart behavior of smart thickening fluid."

            "title": "Time Frequency Analysis of Some Generalized Fourier Transforms",
            "abstract": "In the world of physical science, important physical quantities like sound, pressure, electrical current, voltage, and electromagnetic fields vary with time. Such quantities are labeled as signals/waveforms and include oral signals, optical signals, acoustic signals, biomedical signals, radar, and sonar. Time-frequency analysis is a vital aid in signal analysis, which is concerned with how the frequency of a function (or signal) behaves in time, and it has evolved into a widely recognized applied discipline of signal processing. This book discusses the Fourier transform (FT), which is one of the most valuable and widely used integral transforms that converts a signal from time versus amplitude to frequency versus amplitude. It is one of the oldest tools in the time-frequency analysis of signals. The book includes five chapters that discuss general Fourier transforms as well as new and novel transforms such as hybrid transforms, quadratic-phase Fourier transforms, fractional Fourier transforms, linear canonical transforms, and more",

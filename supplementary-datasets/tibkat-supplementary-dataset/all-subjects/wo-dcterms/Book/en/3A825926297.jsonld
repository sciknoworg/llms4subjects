            "abstract": "Francis Bacon (1561-1626), the famous English philosopher, statesman, and scientist, was extremely influential through his works, especially as an advocate of the scientific method and the creator of empiricism. Natural History was the third part in his best-known work, The Great Instauration, in which Bacon proposed a great reformation of all process of knowledge. Bacon considered science the contemplation of God's power, whereas religion was the revelation of God's will. This Elzevier edition also contains a treatise on the history of the winds. Although most of Bacon's works were first published in his native England, they were reprinted in continental Europe throughout the seventeenth century and beyond",

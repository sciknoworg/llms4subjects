This book represents a collection of papers related to the etiology, epidemiology, and control of fungal trunk diseases in several Mediterranean woody crops such as almond, citrus, grapevine or pistachio, among others. This volume was intended to generate knowledge on the etiology and epidemiology of tree decline syndromes to build a strong foundation for developing effective management approaches to reduce the yield losses caused by these diseases. In addition, a broad collection of techniques to conduct studies on etiology and epidemiology as well as to determine the effect of biotic and abiotic factors enhancing the progression of trunk diseases in woody crops are shown in this book",

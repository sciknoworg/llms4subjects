                "This book presents the results of a joint survey conducted as of the tenth anniversary of the 2011 East Japan Earthquake, by an international research collaboration consisting of researchers representing the major universities affected by recent mega-disasters in Asia, namely, the research group at Kobe University, Japan which has folllowed up ten year recovery process from the 2011 tsunami disaster in East Japan, the research group at the Graduate Program in Disaster Science, Syiah Kuala University in Aceh, Indonesia on the long-term recovery of 17 years after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, the research group at the Institute for Disaster Management and Reconstruction of Sichuan University, China focusing on the recovery status of 13 years after the 2008 Sichuan (Wenchuan) Earthquake; and the research group at the National College of Public Administration and Governance of University of the Philippines, on the rcovery from the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda that hit the Philippines. The purpose of the survey was to evaluate the status of human life recovery of disaster-affected populations and communities in Asia in the long term, for the ultimate purpose of reviewing and comparing the outcomes of different prioritizations among the plural goals of disaster recovery. Through such a review, the authors intend to induce policy implications to guide a better recovery process with lesser impact on the human life recovery in the future disasters that we humans are destined to meet. The target areas are 16 districts in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures in Japan, all typical areas seriously affected by the 2011 tsunami and subsequently came under the governmental construction works for the safety, as well as three villages in Banda Aceh and its outskirts in Aceh Special Province, Indonesia,; two districts in Mianyang city in Sichuan, China which were targetted by intensive reconstructon works conducted by the coupling assistance; and two village communities in Tacloban, the capital city of Leyte island hit by the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda. To realize the concurrent attainment of both safety and livelihood in the recovery planning, this joint survey has identified common issues for a successful cooperation between the local government and communities through the inclusive participation of various institutions representing the variety of interests in each community."

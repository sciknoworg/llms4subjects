                "This book aims to explore the next generation of online learning challenges including the security and privacy issues of digital transformation strategies that is required in teaching and learning. Also, what efforts does the industry need to invest in changing mind-sets and behaviours of both students and faculty members in adoption of virtual and blended learning? The book provides a comprehensive coverage of not only the technical and ethical issues presented by the use of AI, blockchain and self-sovereign identity, but also the adversarial application of AI and its associated implications. The authors recommend a number of novel approaches to assist in better detecting, thwarting and addressing AI challenges in higher education. The book provides a valuable reference for cyber security experts and practitioners, network security professionals and higher education strategist and decision-makers. It is also aimed at researchers seeking to obtain a more profound knowledge of machine learning and deep learning in the context of cyber security and AI in higher education. Each chapter is written by an internationally renowned expert who has extensive experience in industry or academia. Furthermore, this book blends advanced research findings with practice-based methods to provide the reader with advanced understanding and relevant skills."

                "\"This edited volume provides research-based knowledge on the use, production and assessment of multimodal texts in the teaching and learning of English as an Additional Language (EAL). The book reflects growing interest in research on EAL, with increasing numbers of learners of English worldwide and the growing relevance of EAL to numerous education systems. The volume examines different aspects of English from a multimodal perspective, showcasing empirical research from across five continents and all three levels of education. Applying frameworks based on Multimodal Social Semiotics and Systemic Functional Linguistics, chapters focus on the use and affordances of multimodal texts in pedagogy, literature, culture, text production, assessment and curriculum development connected to EAL. Directing attention to the significance of modes beyond speech and writing in EAL, the volume provides a wide range of perspectives and experiences that can be applied more widely and inspire other practices in the global and diverse field of EAL teaching, learning and assessment. This collection will be of interest to scholars in multimodality, language education, and teacher education\"--",

            "abstract": "In the last two decades, we have witnessed the evolution of the energy sector. Many countries throughout the world have been shifting their energy production methods from fossil fuel use to more environmentally friendly methods. These methods are described by the term \u201cRenewable Energy Methods\u201d and entail the production of energy from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) based on wind, water, biomass, solar energy, and geothermal energy. This shift is mainly driven by the increase in public awareness of environmental problems and climate change, which are both related to the increase in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The main goal of this Special Issue is to determine methodologies that can be applied in education in order to raise the awareness of students as well as their families about issues related to renewable sources and energy conservation. Furthermore, the authors studied the factors, parameters, and criteria that affect the decision-making involved in the selection of appropriate types of renewable energy sources in order to select the optimal form, both financially and environmentally. Finally, an attempt is made to recognize methods for communicating the usage of RES and energy savings to the public. Such communication methods are necessary because, in many communities, there are issues surrounding the acceptance of RES installation, as the public considers them to be factors of environmental degradation",

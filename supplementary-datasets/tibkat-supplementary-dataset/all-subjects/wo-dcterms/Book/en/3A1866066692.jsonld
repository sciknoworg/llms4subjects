            "abstract": "\"This new volume delivers the remarkable theoretical and practical findings on the outstanding applications of mycorrhizal fungi in recovering plant health, in producing the mycorrhizal edible forest trees, and in conserving natural resources. It examines the recent research studies based on mycorrhizal technology that have explored the positive impact of root symbiosis on plant adaptation to climate-associated abiotic stressors, such as salinity, drought, flooding, and high temperatures. The book includes thirteen chapters, partitioned into four different parts, authored by international experts and researchers from different domains of plant-mycorrhiza research. Part I explains the role of mycorrhiza in plant growth, in the metabolism of minerals, and in biological control. The book goes on to discuss the extensive commercial applications of mycorrhiza fungi in various industrial sectors including agriculture, horticulture, and biotechnology. Chapters investigate the diverse roles of mycorrhizal fungi in managing different stress conditions. And lastly, the volume provides in-depth analyses of the ways that commercialized mycorrhizal technology can help to maintain global environmental sustainability and food security. Research in mycorrhizal technology is significantly evolving, and cutting-edge findings have provided understanding in how complex plant-mycorrhiza associations work. This volume is designed and edited to serve as a resource text for postgraduate students, botanists, microbiologists, biotechnologists, environmental biologists, and industry professionals who have keen interest and attention on beneficial services and commercialization of mycorrhizal technology\"--",

The Journal of Clinical Medicine (JCM) provides an opportunity to publish data that were presented and discussed at the meeting in Rome in December 2019. One of the extremely important missions of this meeting was to present the recently published guidelines on diagnostic imaging of infections, and find a consensus agreement on some still controversial issues. With this in mind, the aim of the present Special Issue is to publish selected papers on: \u2022 Overviews on published guidelines \u2022 Review on recent development of diagnostic imaging of infections \u2022 Consensus document on the use of FDG and WBC in infections \u2022 Consensus document on the requirement for new radiopharmaceuticals for imaging bacteria",

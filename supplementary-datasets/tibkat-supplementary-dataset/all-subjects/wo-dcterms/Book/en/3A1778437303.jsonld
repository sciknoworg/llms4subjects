            "abstract": "Metric fixed-point theory lies in the intersection of three main subjects: topology, functional analysis, and applied mathematics. The first fixed-point theorem, also known as contraction mapping principle, was abstracted by Banach from the papers of Liouville and Picard, in which certain differential equations were solved by using the method of successive approximation. In other words, fixed-point theory developed from applied mathematics and has developed in functional analysis and topology. Fixed-point theory is a dynamic research subject that has never lost the attention of researchers, as it is very open to development both in theoretical and practical fields. In this Special Issue, among several submissions, we selected eight papers that we believe will be interesting to researchers who study metric fixed-point theory and related applications. It is great to see that this Special Issue fulfilled its aims. There are not only theoretical results but also some applications that were based on obtained fixed-point results. In addition, the presented results have great potential to be improved, extended, and generalized in distinct ways. The published results also have a wide application potential in various qualitative sciences, including physics, economics, computer science, engineering, and so on",

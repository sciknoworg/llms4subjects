            "abstract": "\"This carefully conceived Handbook presents a state-of-the-art discussion of the field of social impact assessment (SIA), highlighting contemporary understandings and emerging issues in this continually evolving area of research and practice. Experienced SIA practitioners from around the world share their learnings and advice on a comprehensive range of issues faced in social performance practice. They explore how SIA has moved far beyond its original role as an ex-ante input into a regulatory environmental licensing process to now serving multiple stakeholders at all stages of the project lifecycle and seeking improved outcomes for host communities. The chapters also reveal how the field and practice of SIA connects with wider discourses, including: business and human rights; environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance; and social licence to operate. Providing an extensive overview of the field of SIA, this incisive Handbook is essential reading for: SIA practitioners; researchers of environmental sociology, environmental psychology, human geography, community psychology, or applied anthropology; and other people with an interest in the social impacts of projects. The Handbook's exploration of how SIA might contribute to better outcomes for communities and projects will also benefit individuals and organizations who commission and review EIAs and SIAs, environmental, social and community NGOs, as well as members of project-affected communities\"--",

            "abstract": "This book invites us to critically reflect on the value of research in, on and for teacher education. It explores the nature and role of teacher education research and identifies ways to enhance its value for policy and practice. It gathers together studies that deploy a wide range of methodologies, including small-scale practitioner-focused research and large-scale empirical studies, considering the value of both approaches for the development of teacher education research that is meaningful for practice, but also valid and relevant for policy. The studies collected in this book were undertaken in different countries and put forward powerful messages for teacher education research in the 21st century. The ultimate objective is to contribute to the generation of a knowledge base for teacher education, identifying strategies and acknowledging challenges. The various arguments presented here can be utilised by teacher education policymakers, practitioners and researchers wishing to enhance the role of teacher education research in their own countries and contexts.

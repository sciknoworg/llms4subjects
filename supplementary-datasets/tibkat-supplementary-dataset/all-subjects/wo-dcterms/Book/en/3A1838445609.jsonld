                "The aim of this book is to help young scientists improve their oral and written communication skills and thus better sell their own results. This book is not a scientific textbook. It addresses the often forgotten question of how to present one's scientific results effectively and convincingly in talks and publications. In addition, this book provides background knowledge on the process of scientific publishing and scientific customs. The recommendations help to develop a good and effective work and communication style that will benefit you throughout your life and bring satisfaction in your work. Furthermore, concrete advice is given on how to write and successfully defend a dissertation and how to take the first steps in career planning. The author Claus Ascheron studied physics at the University of Leipzig. He received his diploma in 1976 and his doctorate in 1980, for which he was awarded the Gustav Hertz Prize of the Physical Society. In 1986 he habilitated. Until 1992 he taught physics at the University of Leipzig. In 1993 he was a visiting professor at the Australian National University in Canberra. This was followed by a two-year Full Professorship at Kyoto University, Japan. From 1995 to 2018, he was the editor responsible for a major part of the physics book program of Springer-Verlag in Heidelberg. He has been invited by numerous international universities and research institutions to teach soft-skill courses on the topics covered in this book. This book is a translation of an original German edition. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation."

            "abstract": "A global health crisis creates great uncertainty, high stress, and anxiety within society. During such a crisis, when information is unavailable or inconsistent, and when people feel unsure of what they know or what anyone knows, behavioral science indicates an increased human desire for transparency, direction, and meaning of what has happened. At such a time, the roles of stakeholders that emerge with their words and actions can help keep people safe, help them cope with emotions, and ultimately bring their experience into context leading to meaningful results. But as this crisis shifts beyond public health and workplace safety, there are implications for business continuity, job loss, and radically different ways of working. While some may already seek meaning from the crisis and move towards the \u201cnext normal,\u201d others feel a growing uncertainty and are worried about the future. Therefore, it is important to analyze the role of stakeholders during these uncertain times.Stakeholder Strategies for Reducing the Impact of Global Health Crises provides a comprehensive resource on stakeholder action and strategies to deal with crises by analyzing the needs of society during global health crises, how stakeholders should communicate, and how resilience and peace can be promoted in times of chaos. The chapters cover the roles of stakeholders during a pandemic spanning from the government and international development agencies to industry and non-government organizations, community-based organizations, and more. This book not only highlights the responsibilities of each of the stakeholders but also showcases the best practices seen during the COVID-19 pandemic through existing theories and case studies. This book is intended for researchers in the fields of sociology, political science, public administration, mass media and communication, crisis and disaster management, and more, along with government officials, policymakers, medical agencies, executives, managers, medical professionals, practitioners, stakeholders, academicians, and students interested in the role of stakeholders during global health crises",

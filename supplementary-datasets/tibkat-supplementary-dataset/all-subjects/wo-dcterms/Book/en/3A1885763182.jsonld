Therefore, the concept of \u201cscientific excellence\u201d has been perceived as a guiding idea in the academics\u2019 efforts. On the other hand, it seems to be an ideal that can never be achieved but towards which one ought to strive persistently. Furthermore, the pursuit of excellence is accompanied by contradictions which have been pointed out many times in the history of academia in Poland. This publishing series embodies the belief in the existence of the so-called invisible college, i.e., the research community, exemplified by young scientists starting their academic path inspired by recognized professors",

                "This book sets the fundamentals of modern weaving at a new level. It contains information for the design of woven structures with complex cross section and multiple layers for modern applications, in the way that leading product developers, professors and researchers are using them now. It starts with the classical weaving principles and patterning and extends these quickly to multilayer structures, produced with single and multiple weft insertion devices, woven structures with complex cross section or direct 3D shape. The engineering methods for design of the structures using modern software and modern algorithms are also explained. Finally, an overview of different application areas is given. The book is written by the world leading experts in their fields and is prepared as learning tool for people interested in modern weaving. Exercises and end-of-chapter summaries will help the reader to check his own knowledge."

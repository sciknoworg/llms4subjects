            "abstract": "\"Innovative Development in Micromanufacturing Processes details cutting edge technologies in micromanufacturing processes, an industry which has undergone a technological transformation in the past decade. Enabling engineers to create high performance, low cost and long-lasting products, this book is an essential companion to all those working in micro and nano engineering. As products continue to get smaller and smaller, the field of micromanufacturing has gained an international audience. This book looks at both approaches of micromanufacturing: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach includes subtractive micromanufacturing processes such as microturning, micromilling, microdrilling, laser beam micromachining and magnetic abrasive finishing. The bottom-up approach involves additive manufacturing processes such as microforming, micro deep drawing, microforging, microextrusion, and microwelding. Additionally, microjoining and microhybrid manufacturing processes are discussed in detail. The book also aids engineers and students in solving common manufacturing issues such as choice of materials and testing. The book will be of interest to those working in micro and nano engineering and machining, as well as students in manufacturing engineering, materials science and more\"--",

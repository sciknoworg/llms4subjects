At the heart of this book are people enrolling at university for the first time and entering into the broad variety of social relations and contexts entailed in their \u2018coming to know\u2019 at, of and through university.By recasting \u2018the transition to university\u2019 as simultaneously and necessarily entailing a transition of university \u2014 indeed universities \u2014 and of their many and varied constitutive relations, structures and practices, the contributors to this book seek to reconceptualise the \u2018first-year experience\u2019 in terms of multiple and dynamic processes of dialogue and exchange amongst all participants. They interrogate taken-for-granted understandings of what \u2018the university\u2019 is, and consider what universities might yet become",

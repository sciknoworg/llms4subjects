            "abstract": "Biosocial Worlds presents state-of-the-art contributions to anthropological reflections on the porous boundaries between human and non-human life \u2013 biosocial worlds. Based on changing understandings of biology and the social, it explores what it means to be human in these worlds. Growing separation of scientific disciplines for more than a century has maintained a separation of the \u2018natural\u2019 and the \u2018social\u2019 that has created a space for projections between the two. Such projections carry a directional causality and so constitute powerful means to establish discursive authority. While arguing against the separation of the biological and the social in the study of human and non-human life, it remains important to unfold the consequences of their discursive separation. Based on examples from Botswana, Denmark, Mexico, the Netherlands, Uganda, the UK and USA, the volume explores what has been created in the space between \u2018the social\u2019 and \u2018the natural\u2019, with a view to rethink \u2018the biosocial\u2019. Health topics in the book include diabetes, trauma, cancer, HIV, tuberculosis, prevention of neonatal disease and wider issues of epigenetics. Many of the chapters engage with constructions of health and disease in a wide range of environments, and engage with analysis of the concept of \u2018environment\u2019. Anthropological reflection and ethnographic case studies explore how \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018environment\u2019 are entangled in ways that move their relation beyond interdependence to one of inseparability. The subtitle of this volume captures these insights through the concept of \u2018health environment\u2019, seeking to move the engagement of anthropology and biology beyond deterministic projections. ; Biosocial Worlds brings together state-of-the-art contributions to critical anthropological reflection on, and ethnographic exploration of, human and non-human life in the light of our changing understandings of biology and what it means to be human",

It provides step-by-step instructions on how to implement Taming Sneaky Fears. The book concludes by addressing common challenges, influences, and outcomes for four- to seven-year-old anxious children and their families and provides recommendations for reducing the barriers to healthy development. Topics featured in this book include: Screening and assessment tools for young anxious children. Innovative assessment approaches for young anxious children. The use of Bravery Ladders to teach young children to overcome their fears and anxieties. Specific adaptations of the Taming Sneaky Fears program for selective mutism and social anxiety disorder.

                "This book presents recent research works related to blast resistant buildings, green roofs and sustainability, retrofit interventions with C-FRP fibers, analysis of cracking in pile cap foundation by delayed ettringite formation and acoustic performance in buildings. It demonstrates that building pathology is a holistic approach to studying and understanding buildings, and in particular, building defects or problems and associated rehabilitation actions. Offering a systematic review of the current state of knowledge, the book serves as a valuable resource for scientists, students, practitioners, and lecturers in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including civil and materials engineering, as well as and other interested parties. ."

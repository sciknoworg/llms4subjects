            "abstract": "Radiology is evolving at a fast pace, and the specific field of cardiovascular and thoracic imaging is no stranger to that trend. While it could, at first, seem unusual to gather these two specialties in a common Issue, the very fact that many of us are trained and exercise in both is more than a hint to the common grounds these fields are sharing. From the ever-increasing role of artificial intelligence in the reconstruction, segmentation, and analysis of images to the quest of functionality derived from anatomy, their interplay is big, and one innovation developed with the former in mind could prove useful for the latter. If the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shed light on the decisive diagnostic role of chest CT and, to a lesser extent, cardiac MR, one must not forget the major advances and extensive researches made possible in other areas by these techniques in the past years. With this Issue, we aim at encouraging and wish to bring to light state-of-the-art reviews, novel original researches, and ongoing discussions on the multiple aspects of cardiovascular and chest imaging",

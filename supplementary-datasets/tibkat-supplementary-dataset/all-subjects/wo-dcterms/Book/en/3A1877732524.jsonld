            "abstract": "Materials properties, whether microscopic or macroscopic, are of immense interest to the materials scientists, physicists, chemists as well as to engineers. Investigation of such properties, theoretically and experimentally, has been one of the fundamental research directions for many years that has also resulted in the discovery of many novel materials. It is also equally important to correctly model and measure these materials properties. Keeping such interests of research communities in mind, this book has been written on the properties of polyesters, varistor ceramics, and powdered porous compacts and also covers some measurement and parameter extraction methods for dielectric materials. Four contributed chapters and an introductory chapter from the editor explain each class of materials with practical examples",

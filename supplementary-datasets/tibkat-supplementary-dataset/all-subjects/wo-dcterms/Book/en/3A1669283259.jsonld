In addition to exploring both the motivation behind choosing to live in a small space, as well as the practical, everyday advice for managing a tight footprint, The Little Book of Living Small also includes case studies: 12 style-savvy, small-space dwellers open their doors and share their design secrets. She covers a range of homes including studio apartments, one- and two-bedroom houses, an RV, a tiny house, a co-living space, and even whole houses. Stylistically these homes range from urban, rural, minimalist, embellish, industrial, and country, with the unifying thread that they are all real homes of less than 1,200 square feet that offer clever solutions that readers can steal for their own homes. Any space can be made to work better and harder; highly readable with actionable advice and beautiful interior photography, this book is one that readers can refer back to often when they need a boost of inspiration or motivation\"--",

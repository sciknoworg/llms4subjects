            "abstract": "Since the 1980s, globalization and neoliberalism have brought about a comprehensive restructuring of everyone\u2019s lives. People are being \u2018disciplined\u2019 by neoliberal economic agendas, \u2018transformed\u2019 by communication and information technology changes, global commodity chains and networks, and in the Global South in particular, destroyed livelihoods, debilitating impoverishment, disease pandemics, among other disastrous disruptions, are also globalization\u2019s legacy.         This collection of geographical treatments of such a complex set of processes unearths the contradictions in the impacts of globalization on peoples\u2019 lives. Globalizations Contradictions firstly introduces globalization in all its intricacy and contrariness, followed on by substantive coverage of globalization\u2019s dimensions. Other areas that are covered in depth are:                          globalization\u2019s macro-economic faces                  globalization\u2019s unruly spaces                  globalization\u2019s geo-political faces                  ecological globalization                  globalization\u2019s cultural challenges                  globalization from below                  fair globalization.                  Globalizations Contradictions is a critical examination of the continuing role of international and supra-national institutions and their involvement in the political economic management and determination of global restructuring. Deliberately, this collection raises questions, even as it offers geographical insights and thoughtful assessments of globalization\u2019s multifaceted \u2018faces and spaces.\u2019",

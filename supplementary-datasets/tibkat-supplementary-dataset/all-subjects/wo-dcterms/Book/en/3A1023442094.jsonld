                "'This is an extremely insightful book on an important and timely topic -- how to get women on to corporate boards. I am proud to have been a part of the discussion and processes presented in this book, and I am impressed by how the editors have put together a systematic and comprehensive overview of the snowball effects of the Norwegian gender balance law. This book will definitely be influential when policy-makers and politicians in various countries are considering voluntary actions or legal regulations to empower women in corporate life.' -- Kjell Magne Bondevik, Director, Oslo Centre for Peace and Human Rights and Former Prime Minister of Norway (1997--2000 and 2001--2005). 'This book provides significant and important insight into the continuing challenge in getting more women on to corporate boards globally. Catalyst has always believed that competing in a global economy requires that companies leverage the talents of both men and women leaders. This book's evidence-based reflections about gender balance in the boardroom, from Norway and beyond, help further the dialogue on this important business issue.' -- Ilene H. Lang, President and CEO, Catalyst. This book provides unique insights into how the idea of quota laws to get women on to corporate boards gained international momentum from its origins in Norway. Invaluable insights are gained through the stories of actors involved in shaping the discourse and practice on women of boards. In exploring political contexts, the role of the advocacy movement, experiences of women directors themselves and latest research findings, the contributors provide a comprehensive overview of the rationales, processes and outcomes of formal approaches to gender diversity on boards. Drawing on insights from political, business and academic actors, the book discusses how and why the Norwegian law on gender equality on corporate boards is turning into a blueprint for action internationally. Getting Women on to Corporate Boards will prove an invaluable resource for policy-makers, principle-setters, practitioners and students interested in the international lessons from Norway, as well as for current and potential female directors"

                "In this book, retired banking CEO Bruce VonCannon considers the past, present and future of Hong Kong, the dynamic finance-driven autonomous city that is beset by global issues- US\u2013China tension, income inequality, housing scarcity, climate change- within the microcosm of a small island archipelago and a hyper-specific local culture. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is today one of the world\u2019s foremost economic and financial hubs and a repository for 18% of the world\u2019s stored wealth, home to the region\u2019s most vibrant stock market, a major free trade port city and traditional gateway to mainland China, the world\u2019s 2nd largest economy. The recent street protests which broke out in June 2019 have been described as a pro-democracy movement. However, other analysts disagree and argue that the street protests have more in common with the populist movements springing up in other parts of the world as the result of a growing divide between rich and poor. This book delves into financial realities, Hong Kong's position within the new global competition between China and the United States, and as a model for the urbanization of the future. Bruce VonCannon, a retired banking CEO, has been based in Hong Kong for over 20 years. In addition to private consultancies, he speaks and writes frequently on economics, finance and politics in the Asia-Pacific region. His Guidebook for the Asian Investor was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2017.",

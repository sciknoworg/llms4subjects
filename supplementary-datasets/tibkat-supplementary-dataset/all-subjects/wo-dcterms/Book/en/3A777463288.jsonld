                "Something over a year ago, I was fortunate enough to preview another VNR book, Controlling Conducted Emissions by Design, by John Fluke. My assessment at the time was that Mr. Fluke had written a very good and useful volume, its only flaw being that it focused on just half of the EMI emissions problem. This, of course, was also its strength; although radiated and conducted emissions do not exist in separate worlds, it can be useful, at least as a point of departure, to look at them as distinct phenomena. Expanding the scope of the conducted emissions book therefore would have served mostly to dilute its purpose and compromise its clarity. After some informal discussions with the publisher on that subject, it was de\u00ad cided to correct the sin of omission by recruiting an author for a companion vol\u00ad ume, to be titled Controlling Radiated Emissions by Design. I am gratified to have played a minor role in making that happen. Many EMC engineers with whom I have worked over the years are capable of writing a good radiated emissions book, but few can match Michel Mardiguian's combination of practical engineering experience and proficiency with the pen. On the engineering side, he has worked on such diverse projects as the Mirage V ver\u00ad tical-takeoff jet fighter, computer-controlled PBX systems and, most recently, the renowned tunnel that stretches beneath the English channel to join England with France.",

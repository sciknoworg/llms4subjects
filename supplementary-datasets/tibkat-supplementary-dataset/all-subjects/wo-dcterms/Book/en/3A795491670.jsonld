            "abstract": "\"Cleavage fracture needs to be described by a comprehensive microphysical model, i.e. to be systematically expounded by the micromechanism. Cleavage fracture is a most dangerous form of fracture, which causes innumerable catastrophic failures of structures and raises casualties resulting in property and human life losses. However with the flourishing development of new structural and functional materials the attentions on the fracture of traditional structural metals have been moved away, despite the fact that tragic accidents of catastrophic failure still happen from time to time. Nowadays, in the field of fracture mechanics rather more interest has been shown in the reproducible measurement of parameters which can be used in engineering design and rather less in the micromechanics of cracking, whether for cleavage or for other brittle fracture types (Thompson, 1993). Although many excellent texts and reference books on the topics of mechanism of fracture have been published such as the splendid one 'Fundamentals of Fracture Mechanics' by K. F. Knott (Knott, 1973), all these documents were exceptional reference sources at the time of their publication and remain to today. However no monographic book on a topic devoted specially on the micromechanism (microphysical model) of cleavage fracture has been published. Moreover, even though since the eighties of the last century considerable contributions have been made in the field concerning cleavage fracture, there is not yet an integrated theoretical system to elucidate its micromechanism\"--",

                "\u201cThis book masterfully interrogates sustainable development, digitalization, and the green economy in Africa post COVID-19. Drawing on a plethora of perspectives, contributors examine dislocated economies, disrupted global supply chains, and distraught governance systems against the backdrop of transitioning to a green economy. Refreshingly, the book pivots on Africa\u2019s aspirations as defined in AU\u2019s Agenda 2063. A must read for all African political actors, development practitioners, scholars, and students of development.\u201d \u2014Dr. George O. Essegbey, President of African Network for Economics of Learning, Innovation and Competence Building (AfricaLics), Nairobi, Kenya \u201cThis timely book provides a wide range of theoretical paradigms and perspectives to explore how Africa is leveraging digital technologies for sustainable development, green and inclusive economy post-COVID- 19. Meticulously researched, the book demonstrates that to win, Africa needs better regulation, governance, and a bridging of its digital divide.\u201d \u2014Dr. Isaac Odoom, Assistant Professor of Political Science and African Studies, Carleton University, Canada This book examines sustainable development in the broader framework of Africa post COVID-19. Specifically, the book studies digitalization and its impact on governance, natural resources, the green economy, agriculture and education. Contributing authors discuss and highlight pathways to meaningful sustainable development leveraging digital technologies. This analytical exercise will better inform economic and sociopolitical policies and institutions for African development by offering unique insights on digitalization, governance, the green economy, \u2018servicification\u2019, and natural resource regime in Africa post COVID-19.

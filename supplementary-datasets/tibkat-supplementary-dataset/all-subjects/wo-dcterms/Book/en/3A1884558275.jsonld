                "This book addresses the recent trends in high-temperature coatings that are used to provide oxidation and wear resistance to metallic/ceramic components in extreme environments. Ceramics, intermetallics, organosilicon polymers, cermets, and other materials with great thermal stability have long been recognized for these applications. This book introduces the state of the art in coating materials and processes for high-temperature environments and identifies areas for improvement in materials selection, performance upgrades, design considerations, and manufacturing methods. The book covers a variety of high-temperature coatings prepared through various synthesis processes such as thermal spraying, physical vapor deposition, electrodeposition, and sol\u2013gel methods. It covers corrosion/oxidation, phase stability, and thermal and mechanical behavior of high-temperature coating materials having greater thermal stability. With contributions from international researchers active in the field, this edited book features the most recent and up-to-date literature references for a broad readership consisting of academic and industrial professionals. It is suitable for graduate students as well as scientists and engineers working in the area of anti-corrosion and anti-wear resistant high-temperature coatings for industrial applications.",

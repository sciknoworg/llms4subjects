            "abstract": "The book presents latest multi-agent technologies in human-centered computing (HCC) to provide a new research direction to enrich the human socio computations. Nowadays, the research in the field of multi-agent system (MAS) has gained a wide spread recognition due to its interdisciplinary nature and a vast versatile application domain including engineering, social science, economics, mathematics, operational research, etc. It has been proved that agents in MAS are the most appropriate technological paradigm for providing the most optimal solution for different kinds of complex real world problems that may be industrial or it might be specifically related to social problems. Keeping these features in mind, we planned to tune the research of latest multi-agent technologies and tried to compose its effect on HCC corridor. The primary audience of this book are research students of computer science, information technology and it will be also very helpful for software professionals to get developmental ideas to boost their computing activities.",

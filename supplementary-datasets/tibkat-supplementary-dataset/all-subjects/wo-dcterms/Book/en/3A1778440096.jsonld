            "abstract": "In an effort to contribute to global efforts by addressing the marine pollution from various emission types, this Special Issue of Ship Lifecyle for Journal of Marine Science and Engineering was inspired to provide a comprehensive insight for naval architects, marine engineers, designers, shipyards, and ship-owners who strive to find optimal ways to survive in competitive markets by improving cycle time and the capacity to reduce design, production, and operation costs while pursuing zero emission. In this context, this Special Issue is devoted to providing insights into the latest research and technical developments on ship systems and operation with a life cycle point of view. The goal of this Special Issue is to bring together researchers from the whole marine and maritime community into a common forum to share cutting-edge research on cleaner shipping. It is strongly believed that such a joint effort will contribute to enhancing the sustainability of the marine and maritime activities. This Special Issue features six novel publications dedicated to this endeavor. First of all, as a proactive response to transitioning to cleaner marine fuel sources, numerous aspects of the excellence of fuel-cell based hybrid ships were demonstrated through four publications. In addition, two publications demonstrated the effectiveness of life cycle assessment (LCA) applicable to marine vessels",

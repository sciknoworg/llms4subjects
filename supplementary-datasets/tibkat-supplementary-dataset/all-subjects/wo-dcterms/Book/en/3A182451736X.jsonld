                "In introducing the National Security Commission on AI\u2019s final report, Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, and Robert Work, former Deputy Secretary of Defense, wrote: \u201cThe human talent deficit is the government\u2019s most conspicuous AI deficit and the single greatest inhibitor to buying, building, and fielding AI-enabled technologies for national security purposes.\u201d Drawing upon three decades of leading hundreds of advanced analytics and AI programs and projects in government and industry, Chris Whitlock and Frank Strickland address in this book the primary variable in the talent deficit, i.e., large numbers of qualified AI leaders. The book quickly moves from a case for action to leadership principles and practices for effectively integrating AI into programs and driving results in AI projects. The chapters convey 37 axioms \u2013 enduring truths for developing and deploying AI \u2013 and over 100 leader practices set among 50 cases and examples, 40 of which focus on AI in national security. Emphasizing its impact and practical nature, LTG (ret.) Ken Tovo, former commander of U.S. Army special forces, characterized the book as \u201cthe Ranger Handbook for AI implementation!\u201d Whether you are a senior or mid-level leader who lacks hands-on experience with AI, or an AI practitioner who lacks leadership experience, this book will equip you to lead AI programs, projects, people, and technology. As the Honorable Robert Work wrote in the foreword: \u201cThis book is not the last word on leading AI in the national security enterprise, but I believe it is an essential starting point.\u201d You will: \u2022 Review axioms or enduring truths at work in six dimensions of AI: program, budget, project, data science, people, and technology \u2022 Apply best practices\u2014such as decision frameworks, processes, checklists\u2014for leading work in each of the six dimensions. \u2022 See how the axioms and best practices are contextualized to national security missions."

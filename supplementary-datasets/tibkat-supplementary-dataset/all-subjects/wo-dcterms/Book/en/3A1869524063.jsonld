                "\u201cIf you want to understand how we might move from political passivity to unlock decolonial and revolutionary action at a European scale, this is a book for you\u201d. \u2014Niccol\u00f2 Milanese, European Alternatives \u201cCombining innovative democratic theory with empirically rich narratives, Oleart has found an ingenious way of contrasting the depoliticized nature of the EU\u2019s \u2018citizen turn\u2019 with fully politicized transnational social movements. A real tour de force and a must-read for all those interested in the question of how to democratize the EU.\u201d \u2014Vivien A. Schmidt, Boston University, USA \u201cThrough the original and powerful concept of the \u2018decolonial multitude\u2019, Oleart provides an empirically grounded critique of the \u2018citizen turn\u2019 in European politics.\u201d \u2014Jan Orbie, Ghent University, Belgium How does the dominant understanding(s) of the demo(i)cratic subject in the EU, and of democracy more broadly, shape the EU\u2019s democratic innovations on \u2018citizen participation\u2019? What are the politically and normatively preferable alternatives, both in terms of the conceptualisation of the democratic subject in the EU and in the ensuing political practices? The book addresses these questions combining a political theory with a political sociology perspective, contrasting the Democracy Without Politics approach of the EU in the context of the Conference on the Future of Europe and its institutional follow-up with that of ongoing transnational activist processes. In doing so, it develops an agonistic alternative to \u2018the people(s)\u2019 as the political imaginary of democracy in the EU, which is based on the idea of the \u2018decolonial multitude\u2019. Thus, the book puts forward a diagnosis of current debates on EU democratic legitimacy as well as proposing an alternative. Alvaro Oleart is a researcher at the Department of Political Science and the Institute for European Studies of the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. He is the author of Framing TTIP in the European Public Spheres: Towards an Empowering Dissensus for EU integration (Palgrave Macmillan, 2021), also published in the Palgrave Studies in European Political Sociology series. .",

            "abstract": "Drought and climate change have decreased water availability for agriculture in arid and semiarid regions, and therefore efficiency enhancements in irrigation water management aimed at conserving water are key to adjust to limits in water supply, as well as improve the profitability and sustainability of agricultural production. Agricultural water management tools and practices that reduce water uses with acceptable impacts on crop production are viable strategies required to cope with diminished water supplies and generate new sources of irrigation water. This Special Issue focuses on \u201cAgricultural Water Conservation: Tools, Strategies, and Practices\u201d, which aims to bring together a collection of recent cutting-edge research and advancements in applied agricultural water conservation. It provides a broad overview focusing on irrigation decision support systems, drought management plans, deficit irrigation strategies, soil mulching, surface and subsurface drip irrigation, conservation tillage, and optimal water and fertilizer management practices",

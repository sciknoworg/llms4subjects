                "This open access two-volume set LNCS 12759 and 12760 constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Computer Aided Verification, CAV 2021, held virtually in July 2021. The 63 full papers presented together with 16 tool papers and 5 invited papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 290 submissions. The papers were organized in the following topical sections: Part I: invited papers; AI verification; concurrency and blockchain; hybrid and cyber-physical systems; security; and synthesis. Part II: complexity and termination; decision procedures and solvers; hardware and model checking; logical foundations; and software verification. This is an open access book.",

            "abstract": "\"Adhesion promoters form a very important group of additives without which many industrial products cannot perform according to requirements. The knowledge on this subject mostly related to silanes, which form the most widely used group of these additives, is still based on the book which was published in the beginning of 1980s. Since then many new additives were introduced into the market. Most of these new additives are not based on silanes but on one of over 30 chemical groups of chemical compounds needed for a variety of products in which silanes do not function, are too expensive, or better performance can be achieved with these new additives. This book fills the existing gap in the literature which still lacks the most recent comprehensive review of current options and knowledge. Handbook of Adhesion Promoters contains 10 chapters each discussing essential aspect of the application of adhesion promoters. The known mechanisms which belong to one of 13 groups outline principles of use, action, and application of these additives. This chapter is followed by the discussion of mechanisms which cause adhesion loss, such as corrosion, delamination, detachment, liquid penetration, and peeling.\"--",

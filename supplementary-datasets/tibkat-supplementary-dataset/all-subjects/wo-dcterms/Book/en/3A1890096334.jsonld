                "Boundary Element Method for Magnetohydrodynamic Flow\u201d offers one of the first systematic and detailed treatments of the application of boundary element method (BEM) to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow problems. It aims to fill in the gaps left by the earlier books on the application of BEM to some physical problems such as fluid dynamics, elasticity, and geophysics. An overview of the theory of MHD flow and a comprehensive mathematical formulation of BEM for convection-diffusion-type differential equations are provided by the authors, who heavily rely on their research and experience in the disciplines of BEM and MHD flow. The book first discusses the basic principles of the BEM approach for the MHD duct flow problems in coupled form with the fundamental solution derived by the authors. Specifically, the BEM solutions of MHD flow in pipes of rectangular or circular cross-sections, and MHD flow in infinite regions, are all covered emphasizing the convergence of infinite boundary integrals. This book, especially, concentrates on the MHD flow in regions with partly insulated partly perfectly conducting boundaries by BEM giving also the parabolic boundary layer thickness emanating from the points of discontinuities on the walls. The book secondly includes the dual reciprocity boundary element technique (DRBEM), an alternative form of BEM that expands the applicability of BEM to MHD flow and heat transfer problems as well as buoyancy MHD flow with magnetic potential and inductionless MHD flow. The purpose of the book is to serve as a research book for applied mathematicians, engineers, scientists, and graduate students who wish to learn in-depth about the formulation and application of BEM in MHD flow problems. As such, it is an invaluable resource and a major contribution to the numerical solution of MHD flow problems.",

            "abstract": "\"Data Visualization in Excel closes the gap between what people think Excel can do and what they can achieve in the tool. Over the past few years, recognition of the importance of effectively visualizing data has led to an explosion of data analysis and visualization software tools. But for many people, Microsoft Excel continues to be the workhorse for their data visualization needs, not to mention the only tool that many data workers have access to. Although Excel is not a specialist data visualization platform, it does have strong capabilities. The default chart types do not need to be the limit of the tool's data visualization capabilities, and users can extend its features by understanding some key elements and strategies. This book provides a step-by-step guide to creating more advanced and often more effective data visualizations in Excel and is the perfect guide for anyone who wants to create better, more effective, and more engaging data visualizations. Jonathan Schwabish is an economist and data communication expert working and living outside Washington, DC. Dr. Schwabish is considered a leader in the data visualization field and is a leading voice for clarity and accessibility in research. Dr. Schwabish is a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a non-profit research institution in Washington, DC, and is the founder of the data visualization and presentation skills firm, Policy Viz. He helps non-profits, research institutions, and governments at all levels improve how they communicate their work and findings to their colleagues, partners, clients, and constituents\"--",

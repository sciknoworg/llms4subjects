            "abstract": "The main scope of this study is to emphasize exergy efficiency in all fields of industry. The chapters collected in the book are contributed by invited researchers with a long-standing experience in different research areas. I hope that the material presented here is understandable to a wide audience, not only energy engineers but also scientists from various disciplines. The book contains seven chapters in three sections: (1) \"General Information about Exergy,\" (2) \"Exergy Applications,\" and (3) \"Thermoeconomic Analysis.\" This book provides detailed and up-to-date evaluations in different areas written by academics with experience in their fields. It is anticipated that this book will make a scientific contribution to exergy workers, researchers, academics, PhD students, and other scientists in both the present and the future",

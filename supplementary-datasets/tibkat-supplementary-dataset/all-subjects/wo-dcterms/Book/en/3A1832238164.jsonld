            "abstract": "This includes 17 original research articles and focuses on the knowledge on the effects of dietary antioxidants on host health and performance of production animals, including livestock, poultry and fish. It provides various nutritional approaches to improve antioxidant capacity and benefit host health in animal production. Production animals exposed to air pollution, heavy metals, or other stressful conditions can experience oxidative stress that may suppress animal health, performance, and production, subsequently impacting economic feasibility; hence, maintaining and improving oxidative status, especially through an appropriate nutrition strategy, are essential for normal physiological processes in animals. Promising research results have revealed that the administration of natural or synthetic antioxidants in an animal's diet may be an important strategy to mitigate the negative influence induced by oxidative stress conditions. The Special Issue has been conceived to set out the knowledge on the effects of dietary antioxidants on host health and performance of production animals. It provides various nutritional approaches, mainly including vitamins, plant extracts, trace elements, non-essential amino acids, etc., to improve antioxidant capacity and benefit host health in livestock, poultry and fish. This book will encourage more scientists to move forward on the path to increasing knowledge on the effect of natural or synthetic antioxidants on the growth and health of production animals",

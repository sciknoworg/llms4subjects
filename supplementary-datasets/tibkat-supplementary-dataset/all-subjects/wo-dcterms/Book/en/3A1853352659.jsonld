            "abstract": "The application fields of colloid and interface chemistry are very wide, covering many aspects such as industrial and agricultural production, daily chemistry, enhanced oil recovery, and so on. The traditional experimental analysis of a colloid and interface chemistry system includes various instrumental analysis methods such as spectroscopy, rheometer, microscopes, etc. In recent decades, molecular simulation has become an important research method in this field. It can investigate at the molecular level and provide mechanisms or insights that are hard or even impossible to obtain from an experiment. Many applications of molecular simulation have been reported in the literature, such as the behavior of surfactant, self-assembly, enhanced oil recovery, adsorption around interface, etc. This reprint has collected ten research articles which relate to the application of molecular dyamics simulation in colloide and interface chemistry",

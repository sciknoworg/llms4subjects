It provides important original and theoretical experimental results which use non-routine technologies often unfamiliar to some readers and covers novel applications of more familiar experimental techniques and analyses of composite problems. This book gives insight and a better understanding into the development of green composite materials and advanced manufacturing technology used in various manufacturing sectors. It highlights recent trends in the fields of green composites, metal matrix composites, ceramic matrix composites, surface modification using laser cladding, types of dust collectors in waste management and recycling in industries, machinability studies of metals and composites using surface grinding, drilling, electrical discharge machining, joining of metals using friction stir welding, shielded metal arc welding and linear friction welding. This book is written for engineering students, postgraduate students, research scholars, faculty members and industry professionals those who are involved with green composite materials and advanced manufacturing technology\"--",

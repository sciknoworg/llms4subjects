                "This book explores the leadership of state and federal environmental agencies and local environmental groups in restoring the degraded rivers that flow into North America\u2019s Great Lakes and other sites in the northeastern industrial corridor of the US. Robinson examines twenty of the forty-eight sites included in the Areas of Concern Program of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the US. These twenty include heavily urbanized locales such as those along the River Rouge and Detroit River, but also more pristine locales such as the St. Louis River that flows through Duluth. Additionally, Robinson examines challenging river restorations within the northeastern industrial corridor which are led by effective local environmental advocacy organizations: the Penobscot Nation of Indigenous People, the Mystic River Watershed Association, and the Housatonic River Valley Association. All of these river restorations are led and managed by the environmental experts of (i) state and federal agencies, (ii) academia, and (iii) environmental NGOs. Local restorations of industrially degraded water bodies now compose a significant segment of the environmental movement and, ultimately, Robinson demonstrates that local environmental advocacy organizations can help marshal state and local funding for those efforts. Richard M. Robinson is Professor of Business at the State University of New York at Fredonia (SUNY Fredonia), USA. He is the author of Environmental Organizations and Reasoned Discourse (2021), Business Ethics: Kant, Virtue, and the Nexus of Duty (2021), and The Imperfect Duties of Management (2018)."

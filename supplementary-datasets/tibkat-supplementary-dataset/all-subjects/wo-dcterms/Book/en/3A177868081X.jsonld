This problem attracts the attention of various specialists in the field of medicine and biology every year. In recent years there has been a significant increase of mesothelioma morbidity in most of the countries, due to the further industrialization of society.

The book consists of 14 chapters containing the most advanced achievements of all aspects of the various types of mesotheliomas, both in humans and domestic animals, at a high methodological level. This book is intended for biologists and all health care workers, mostly oncologists of different profiles, as well as students of medical educational institutions engaged or even just interested in the problems of mesotheliomas",

            "abstract": "The Social Network Analysis perspective has proven the ability to develop a significant breadth of theoretical and methodological issues witnessed by the contribution of an increasing number of scholars and the multiplication of empirical applications in a wide range of scientific fields. One of the disciplinary areas in which this development has occurred, among others, is certainly that of computational social science, by virtue of the developing field of online social networks and the leading role of information technologies in the production of scientific knowledge. The complex nature of social phenomena enforced the usefulness of the network perspective as a wealth of theoretical and methodological tools capable of penetrating within the dimensions of that complexity. The book hosts eleven contributions that within a sound theoretical ground, present different examples of speculative and applicative areas where the Social Network Analysis can contribute to explore, interpret and predict social interaction between actors. Some of the contributions were presented at the ARS\u201919 Conference held in Vietri sul Mare (Salerno, Italy) in October, 29-31 2019; it was the seventh of a biennial meetings series started in 2007 with the aim to promote relevant results and the most recent methodological developments in Social Network Analysis",

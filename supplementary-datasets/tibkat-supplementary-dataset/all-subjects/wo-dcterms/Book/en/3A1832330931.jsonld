What is shown is that, in spite of restrictions placed on their activity, they developed extremely rapidly. It became obvious that there was a reserve of entrepreneurial talents ready to be liberated. What developed, however, over the four-year period 1987-1990 was not private enterprise in the full Western sense of the term; not all of the cooperatives were free-standing, independent organizations. On the contrary, what developed were also forms that combined the state and private sectors in a variety of ways",

            "abstract": "Women play a significant role in the Blue Economy sectors, such as in fisheries, aquaculture, processing and trading of marine products, waste management, coastal tourism, conservation activities, and coastal disaster-risk reduction, among others. However, gender norms often prevent women from developing and contributing their full potential in the Blue Economy. Women tend to have fewer opportunities to access education and skills-building activities and have low ownership, access, and control over key productive resources that are basic to their livelihoods. In the labor market, women are present less than men. Women are also affected by Gender-Based Violence (GBV). These risks jeopardize long-term sustainability objectives since women are key players in coastal and marine communities and provide households' subsistence, particularly in women-headed households. International efforts have shown that more systematically and effectively integrating women in coastal economies along with addressing disparities has decreased gender gaps. These efforts have also delivered an increase in women's income, improvements in local livelihood activities, and brought positive impacts to marine life conservation. Thus, addressing gender gaps is key for women's development, and that of their families, communities, and the economy, as well as the progress and sustainability of the Blue Economy",

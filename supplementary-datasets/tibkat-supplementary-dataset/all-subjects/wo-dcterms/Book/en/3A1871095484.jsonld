                "Cereal grains and their products are staples in the diet of almost every culture of the world and have made an important contribution to daily nutrient requirements. Cereal grains are high in carbohydrates, good sources of protein and provide varying amounts of fibre, vitamins and minerals. The nutritional composition of grains may vary depending on the variety and environmental growing conditions. A number of cereal products are prepared from all the regions of the world. Cereals are processed into many products such as bread, cookies, cakes and pasta and are consumed daily by the majority of the population and play an important place in human nutrition. Cereal Based Food Products is the first book of its kind, focusing on the preparation methodology of cereal products. The chapters focus on different types of cereal products, processing technology, quality aspects and packaging requirements. All of the important cereal-based foods are covered in full, including sections on bread, cookies, cakes and muffins, pasta and noodles and many more including their packaging, preparation methods and ingredients. With this text researchers will find a comprehensive single source for information on the processing of cereal-based food products. Covers different types of products prepared from cereal grains; Focuses on production technology for the development of cereal products; Presents information on packaging requirements of cereal products.",

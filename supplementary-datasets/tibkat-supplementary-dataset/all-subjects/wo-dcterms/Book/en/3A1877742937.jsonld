            "abstract": "The integration of recent and emerging energy technologies in the existing electric grid requires modifications in several aspects of the grid, including its architecture, protection, operation, and control. Micro-grid provides a solution for integrating distributed energy resources such as renewable energy generation, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, controllable loads, etc. and delivers flexibility, security, and reliability by operating in both grid-connected and isolated modes. This book provides an overview of micro-grid solutions, applications, and implementations. State-of-the-art methods for micro-grid operation, optimization, and control are presented. Distributed energy resources and their interactions in micro-grids are also studied. In addition, micro-grid designs, architectures, and standards are covered, as are micro-grid protection strategies and schemes for different operation modes",

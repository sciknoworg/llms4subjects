                "book and to the publisher NOORDHOFF who made possible the appearance of the second edition and enabled the author to introduce the above-mentioned modifi\u00ad cations and additions. Moscow M. A. NAIMARK August 1963 FOREWORD TO THE SECOND SOVIET EDITION In this second edition the initial text has been worked over again and improved, certain portions have been completely rewritten; in particular, Chapter VIII has been rewritten in a more accessible form. The changes and extensions made by the author in the Japanese, German, first and second (= first revised) American, and also in the Romanian (lithographed) editions, were hereby taken into account. Appendices II and III, which are necessary for understanding Chapter VIII, have been included for the convenience of the reader. The book discusses many new theoretical results which have been developing in\u00ad tensively during the decade after the publication of the first edition. Of course, lim\u00ad itations on the volume of the book obliged the author to make a tough selection and in many cases to limit himself to simply a formulation of the new results or to pointing out the literature. The author was also compelled to make a choice of the exceptionally extensive collection of new works in extending the literature list. Monographs and survey articles on special topics of the theory which have been published during the past decade have been included in this list and in the litera\u00ad ture pointed out in the individual chapters."

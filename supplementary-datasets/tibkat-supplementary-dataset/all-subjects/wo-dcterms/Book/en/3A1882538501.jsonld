            "abstract": "\"In the past, petroleum-based polymers were favoured because of low cost, better mechanical properties, and ease of production. The fast production of such polymers has a negative effect on the environment and the economy at large. As an example, the utilization of oil and gas has led to an increase in oil and natural gas prices. Therefore, there is a need for the production and development of biodegradable polymers for sustainable applications of plastics. The positive impact of biodegradable polymers is their ability to degrade in the natural environment. This book covers an in-depth discussion on the synthesis of polylactic acid (PLA) and its applications. Polylactic acid is fabricated from renewable sources such as corn, sorghum wheat and straw. However, there a need for high performance polymer materials in industrial applications, which prompted the researcher to produce biocomposites for advanced applications. In this book, carbon-based fillers incorporated in PLA matrix are discussed in relation to flame retardancy, mechanical properties, and thermal stability for the utilization of such composites in advanced applications\"--",

            "abstract": "From past decades, Computational intelligence embraces a number of nature-inspired computational techniques which mainly encompasses fuzzy sets, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks and hybrid neuro-fuzzy systems to address the computational complexities such as uncertainties, vagueness and stochastic nature of various computational problems practically. At the same time, Intelligent Control systems are emerging as an innovative methodology which is inspired by various computational intelligence process to promote a control over the systems without the use of any mathematical models. To address the effective use of intelligent control in Computational intelligence systems, International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Information and Control Systems (ICICCS 2019) is initiated to encompass the various research works that helps to develop and advance the next-generation intelligent computing and control systems. This book integrates the computational intelligence and intelligent control systems to provide a powerful methodology for a wide range of data analytics issues in industries and societal applications. The recent research advances in computational intelligence and control systems are addressed, which provide very promising results in various industry, business and societal studies. This book also presents the new algorithms and methodologies for promoting advances in common intelligent computing and control methodologies including evolutionary computation, artificial life, virtual infrastructures, fuzzy logic, artificial immune systems, neural networks and various neuro-hybrid methodologies. This book will be pragmatic for researchers, academicians and students dealing with mathematically intransigent problems. It is intended for both academicians and researchers in the field of Intelligent Computing, Information and Control Systems, along with the distinctive readers in the fields of computational and artificial intelligence to gain more knowledge on Intelligent computing and control systems and their real-world applications",

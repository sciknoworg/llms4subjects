            "abstract": "In October 2009 it was reported that 68 of 101 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in the United States, when tested, were infected with a novel gamma retrovirus, xenotropic  murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) (Lombardi et al., 2009). XMRV is a recently  discovered human gammaretrovirus first described in prostate cancers that shares  significant homology with murine leukemia virus (MLV) (Ursiman et al., 2006). It is known  that XMRV can cause leukemias and sarcomas in several rodent, feline, and primate species  but has not been shown to cause disease in humans. XMRV was detectable in the peripheral  blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma of individuals diagnosed with CFS  (Lombardi et al., 2009). After this report was published there was a great deal of uncertainty  surrounding this emergent virus and its involvement in the etiology of CFS. The uncertainty  was, in part, due to CFS being a complex, poorly understood multi-system disorder with  different disease criteria used for its diagnosis. CFS, also known as Myalgic  Encephalomyelitis (ME), is a debilitating disease of unknown origin that is estimated to  affect 17 million people worldwide. The initial report connecting XMRV to prostate cancers  and CFS garnered significant media and scientific interest since it provided a potential    Susie ElSaadany2**, Tamer Oraby1  *  Daniel Krewski1, 4 and Peter R.

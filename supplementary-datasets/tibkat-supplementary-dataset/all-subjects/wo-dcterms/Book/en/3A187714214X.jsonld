                "This volume examines the growing presence of populism, partisanship, and polarization and analyzes what this means for scandalization processes. While politics appears to have entered a mode of perpetual crisis and growing dysfunctionality, the rapid succession of scandals may be a symptom of this crisis and its catalyst at the same time. The book provides a better definition of political scandals and discusses from an interdisciplinary and critical scientific perspective how such scandals are relevant to political developments and how they impact public discourse and media practices. International experts from various subfields of communication studies, political communication research as well as related disciplines contribute to the volume with conceptual, empirical, and methodological approaches which reflect on political scandals and the role of media and/or communication. Presenting a unique perspective and providing a first in-depth insight into the relationship between polarization, partisanship, populist communication, and scandalization, the book will appeal to students, researchers, and scholars from different disciplines, as well as practitioners and policy-makers interested in a better understanding of political scandals, their impact on public discourse and political developments, and their catalyzation through media and communication.",

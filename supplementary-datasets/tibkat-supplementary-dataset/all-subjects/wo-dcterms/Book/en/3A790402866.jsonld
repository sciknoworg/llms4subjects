            "abstract": "Annotation, Extensively revised and updated to encompass the latest developments in the PIC 18FXXX series, this book demonstrates how to develop a range of microcontroller applications through a project-based approach. After giving an introduction to programming in C using the popular mikroC Pro for PIC and MPLAB XC8 languages, this book describes the project development cycle in full. The book walks you through fully tried and tested hands-on projects, including many new, advanced topics such as Ethernet programming, digital signal processing, and RFid technology. This book is ideal for engineers, technicians, hobbyists and students who have knowledge of the basic principles of PIC microcontrollers and want to develop more advanced applications using the PIC18F series. This book Includes over fifty projects which are divided into three categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. New projects in this edition: Logic probe Custom LCD font design Hi/Lo game Generating various waveforms in real-time Ultrasonic height measurement Frequency counter Reaction timer GPS projects Closed-loop ON/OFF temperature control Bluetooth projects (master and slave) RFid projects Clock using Real-time-clock (RTC) chip RTC alarm project Graphics LCD (GLCD) projects Barometer+thermometer+altimeter project Plotting temperature on GLCD Ethernet web browser based control Ethernet UDP based control Digital signal processing (Low Pass Filter design) Automotive LIN bus project Automotive CAN bus project Multitasking projects (using both cooperative and Round-robin scheduling) Unipolar stepper motor projects Bipolar stepper motor projects Closed-loop ON/OFF DC motor control A clear introduction to the PIC 18FXXX microcontroller's architecture Covers developing wireless and sensor network applications, SD card projects, and multi-tasking; all demonstrated with the block and circuit diagram, program description in PDL, program listing, and program descriptionIncludes more than 50 basic, intermediate, and advanced projects",

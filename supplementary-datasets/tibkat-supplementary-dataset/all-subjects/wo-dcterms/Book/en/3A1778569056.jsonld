            "title": "Highlights on Several Underestimated Topics in Palliative Care",
            "abstract": "This book focuses on several underestimated topics in palliative care. Seven chapters have been divided into four sections: Ethical Issues, Volunteers in Palliative Care, Special Circumstances, and Prognostic Models in Palliative Care. The underestimated topics concern several ethical themes such as the Balance sheets of suffering, Good Death, Euthanasia, Assisted suicide, and the question of the 'Do not attempt resuscitation'. In addition, the role of volunteers, the approach to non-malignant diseases such as diabetes and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are also addressed. Finally, the features and utility of different tools in order to facilitate optimal decision making for both physicians and patients, are given in details. This book will aid several figures facing the daily challenges of palliative care. Clinicians, nurses, volunteers, students and resident trainees, and other professionals can find this volume useful in their very difficult but extraordinarily fascinating mission",

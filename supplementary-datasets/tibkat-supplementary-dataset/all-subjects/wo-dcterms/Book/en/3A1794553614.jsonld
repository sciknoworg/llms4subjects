            "abstract": "Plant viruses cause many of the most important diseases threatening crops worldwide. Over the last quarter of a century, an increasing number of plant viruses have emerged in various parts of the world, especially in the tropics and subtropics. As is generally observed for plant viruses, most of the emerging viruses are transmitted horizontally by biological vectors, mainly insects. Reverse genetics using infectious clones\u2014available for many plant viruses\u2014has been used for identification of viral determinants involved in virus\u2013host and virus\u2013vector interactions. Although many studies have identified a number of factors involved in disease development and transmission, the precise mechanisms are unknown for most of the virus\u2013plant\u2013vector combinations. In most cases, the diverse outcomes resulting from virus\u2013virus interactions are poorly understood. Although significant advances have been made towards understand the mechanisms involved in plant resistance to viruses, we are far from being able to apply this knowledge to protect cultivated plants from the all viral threats.The aim of this Special Issue was to provide a platform for researchers interested in plant virology to share their recent results. To achieve this, we invited the plant virology community to submit research articles, short communications and reviews related to the various aspects of plant virology: ecology, virus\u2013plant host interactions, virus\u2013vector interactions, virus\u2013virus interactions, and control strategies. This issue contains some of the best current research in plant virology",

                "This is the official record of the International Symposium on \"The Role of Nuclear Engineering for an Uncertain Future\" which was held on No\u00ad vember 5 and 6, 1980, at Keidanren Hall in Tokyo, in connection with the 20th Anniversary of the Nuclear Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, University of Tokyo. Eight specialists from all over the world were invited to contribute papers to the symposium, and the professors of our Department presented a paper each. The Symposium was divided into seven sessions, chaired by profes\u00ad sors of the Department according to their specialties. About 200 scientists attended the symposium, and some of them joined the discussions. The symposium was fruitful and very successful from every point of view, and highly evaluated by the attendants as well as by con\u00ad cerned people outside. This success is due to the successful organization and good performance of the staff of this symposium, to whom I would like to express my grat\u00ad itude. I also hope that these proceedings will be useful to the specialists who are concerned with the uncertain future of nuclear engineering as well as with the role of Universities in that future.",

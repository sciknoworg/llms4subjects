            "title": "Kafka's Zoopoetics : Beyond the Human-Animal Barrier",
            "abstract": "Nonhuman figures are ubiquitous in the work of Franz Kafka, from his early stories down to his very last one. Despite their prominence throughout his oeuvre, Kafka\u2019s animal representations have been considered first and foremost as mere allegories of intrahuman matters. In recent years, the allegorization of Kafka\u2019s animals has been poetically dismissed by Kafka\u2019s commentators and politically rejected by posthumanist scholars. Such critique, however, has yet to inspire either an overarching or an interdiscursive account. This book aims to fill this lacuna. Positing animal stories as a distinct and significant corpus within Kafka\u2019s entire poetics, and closely examining them in dialogue with both literary and posthumanist analysis, Kafka\u2019s Zoopoetics critically revisits animality, interspecies relations, and the very human-animal contradistinction in the writings of Franz Kafka. Kafka\u2019s animals typically stand at the threshold between humanity and animality, fusing together human and nonhuman features. Among his liminal creatures we find a human transformed into vermin (in \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d), an ape turned into a human being (in \u201cA Report to an Academy\u201d), talking jackals (in \u201cJackals and Arabs\u201d), a philosophical dog (in \u201cResearches of a Dog\u201d), a contemplative mole-like creature (in \u201cThe Burrow\u201d), and indiscernible beings (in \u201cJosefine, the Singer or the Mouse People\u201d). Depicting species boundaries as mutable and obscure, Kafka creates a fluid human-animal space, which can be described as \u201chumanimal.\u201d The constitution of a humanimal space radically undermines the stark barrier between human and other animals, dictated by the anthropocentric paradigm. Through denying animalistic elements in humans, and disavowing the agency of nonhuman animals, excluding them from social life, and neutralizing compassion for them, this barrier has been designed to regularize both humanity and animality. The contextualization of Kafka's animals within posthumanist theory engenders a post-anthropocentric arena, which is simultaneously both imagined and very real",

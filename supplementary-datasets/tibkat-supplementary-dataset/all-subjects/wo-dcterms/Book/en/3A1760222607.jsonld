            "abstract": "This book covers aspects of multiphase flow and heat transfer during phase change processes, focusing on boiling and condensation in microscale channels. The authors present up-to-date predictive methods for flow pattern, void fraction, pressure drop, heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux, pointing out the range of operational conditions that each method is valid. The first four chapters are dedicated on the motivation to study multiphase flow and heat transfer during phase change process, and the three last chapters are focused on the analysis of heat transfer process during boiling and condensation. During the description of the models and predictive methods, the trends are discussed and compared with experimental findings. Provides a comprehensive description of flow patterns during the phase change process for boiling and condensation in conventional and micro scale channels; Discusses changes of trends of experimental results based on the operational conditions; Compiles up-to-date predictive methods for void fraction, flow pattern, pressure drop, and heat transfer coefficient during convective flow boiling and condensation in micro scale channels; Serves as a roadmap for design of heat spreaders based on micro-scale channels.",

                "At a moment when both think tanks and experts are being questioned, significant policy and technology disruptions have called into question the value and efficacy of policy advice. Within that context, Dr. McGann launched this book to examine the future of think tanks and policy advice around the world with a series of authoritative reflections written by the presidents of some of the leading think tanks in every region of the world. The book explores the challenges think tanks face today in an information rich and highly competitive operating environment that includes: the impact of technology, big data and artificial intelligence, competition from advocacy groups and public relations firms, increased polarization of politics and major changes in how think tanks are funded. James G. McGann is Senior Lecturer of International Studies at the Lauder Institute at the Wharton School and the School of Arts and Sciences, Director of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program and Senior Fellow at the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also the Director of the Think Tanks and Foreign Policy Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.",

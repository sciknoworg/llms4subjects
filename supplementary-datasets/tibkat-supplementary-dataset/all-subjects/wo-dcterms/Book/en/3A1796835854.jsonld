                "The intelligent sports analysis of a soccer ball (also known as football, football ball, or association football ball) requires accurately simulating its motion and finding the best design parameters. Employing classic mechanics, this book establishes a fundamental framework for the soccer ball multi-body dynamics modeling, virtual prototype simulation and optimization design. It presents 3D virtual prototypes to predict the soccer ball trajectory for soccer players and trainers. Five typical case studies have addressed in the kinematics and dynamics simulations of soccer ball projectile motion, free kick, and corner kick in the virtual environment. The research on multi-body dynamics models provides a useful method for engineers and scientists to investigate the spatial kinematics and dynamics performances of various balls, such as soccer ball, gulf ball, American football, etc. The book is significant to guide undergraduate and graduate students from multi-disciplines to study system dynamics and optimization design. .",

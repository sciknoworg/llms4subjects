            "abstract": "\"The integration of electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, control and computer engineering - Mechatronics - lies at the heart of the innumerable gadgets, processes and technology that makes modern life would seem impossible. From auto-focus cameras to car engine management systems, and from state-of-the-art robots to the humble washing machine, Mechatronics has a hand in them all. This book presents a clear and comprehensive introduction to the area. Practical and applied, it helps you to acquire the mix of skills you will need to comprehend and design mechatronic systems. It also goes much deeper, explaining the very philosophy of mechatronics, and, in so doing, provides you with a frame of understanding to develop a truly interdisciplinary and integrated approach to engineering. This 7th edition has been updated throughout with new sections and examples throughout: - Updated coverage of mechatronic system components, including extended coverage of encoders, position sensitive detectors and force sensitive resistors - New material on Atmega microcontrollers including applications and programming examples - Topical discussion and examples of fuzzy logic and neural control systems Applications and case studies have been revised across the book, with fascinating examples including automated guided vehicles, artificial hands, fuzzy logic washing machines, to help you to gain a modern and practical understanding Mechatronics is essential reading for students requiring an introduction to this exciting area at undergraduate and higher diploma level\"--",

            "abstract": "Embedded systems are today, widely deployed in just about every piece of machinery from toasters to spacecraft. Embedded system designers face many challenges. They are asked to produce increasingly complex systems using the latest technologies, but these technologies are changing faster than ever. They are asked to produce better quality designs with a shorter time-to-market. They are asked to implement increasingly complex functionality but more importantly to satisfy numerous other constraints. To achieve the current goals of design, the designer must be aware with such design constraints and more importantly, the factors that have a direct effect on them.One of the challenges facing embedded system designers is the selection of the optimum processor for the application in hand; single-purpose, general-purpose or application specific. Microcontrollers are one member of the family of the application specific processors.The book concentrates on the use of microcontroller as the embedded system?s processor, and how to use it in many embedded system applications. The book covers both the hardware and software aspects needed to design using microcontroller.The book is ideal for undergraduate students and also the engineers that are working in the field of digital system design.Contents\u2022 Preface;\u2022 Process design metrics;\u2022 A systems approach to digital system design;\u2022 Introduction to microcontrollers and microprocessors;\u2022 Instructions and Instruction sets;\u2022 Machine language and assembly language;\u2022 System memory; Timers, counters and watchdog timer;\u2022 Interfacing to local devices / peripherals;\u2022 Analogue data and the analogue I/O subsystem;\u2022 Multiprocessor communications;\u2022 Serial Communications and Network-based interfaces",

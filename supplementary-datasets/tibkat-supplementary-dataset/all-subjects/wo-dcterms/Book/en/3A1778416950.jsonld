            "abstract": "In January 2020, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), The Food Trust, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Healthy Eating Research (HER) met for a Healthy Retail Research Convention in Washington, D.C. Attendees included food industry representatives, researchers, and nonprofit organizations. The objective of the convention was to develop a national healthy retail research agenda by (1) determining the effectiveness of government policies, corporate practices, and in-store pilots in promoting healthy eating; (2) identifying gaps in the healthy food retail literature and generating questions for future research, with an intentional focus on reducing health disparities and improving equity; (3) highlighting best practices for partnering with retailers and food manufacturers on healthy retail research; (4) facilitating relationships between retailers and researchers to implement and evaluate retail interventions; and (5) identifying existing datasets, ongoing work, and new opportunities for retail\u2013research partnerships",

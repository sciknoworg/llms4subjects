            "abstract": "Conservation biology is a rapidly evolving discipline, with its historically synthetic, multidisciplinary framework having expanded extensively in recent years. Seemingly disparate disciplines, such as behavior and physiology, are being integrated into this discipline\u2019s growing portfolio, resulting in diverse tools that can help develop conservation solutions. Demonstrations are needed, however, of how behavior and physiology \u2014 either separately or combined \u2014 have contributed to conservation success. Behavior and physiology have traditionally been considered separate fields; yet, their integration can provide a more comprehensive approach to offering solutions to conservation and management problems. Examining species\u2019 vulnerabilities to extinction through the lenses of behavior and physiology can provide insight into the mechanisms that drive population declines and extirpations. Our goal is to increase awareness of the benefit of combining behavioral and physiological tools to improve conservation management decisions. Such studies can also help strengthen the basis for evidence-based conservation which, in some cases, has been previously lacking",

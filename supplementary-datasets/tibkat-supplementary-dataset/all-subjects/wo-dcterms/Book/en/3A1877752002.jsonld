            "abstract": "Metamaterials have become one of the most important emerging technologies in the scientific community due to its unusual electromagnetic properties. Consequently, during the last years, a huge deal of efforts has been concentrated in order to design functional components and devices based on metamaterials for many potential applications. The main objective of this book is to present in-depth analysis of the theory, properties, and realizations of novel devices that could be integrated within modern and future communication systems. The book contains 11 chapters written by acknowledged experts, researchers, academics, and microwave engineers, providing comprehensive information and covering a wide range of topics on several aspects of microwaves and optics, including polarization conversion, asymmetric transmission, transmission lines, filters, plasmonic lenses, tunable metamaterials, light manipulation, absorbers, and antennas, among others. This book is suitable for scholars from large scientific domain and therefore given to engineers, scientists, graduates, and other interested professionals as a reference on these artificial materials of tomorrow",

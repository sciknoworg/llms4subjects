            "abstract": "Intended for use in a one- or two-semester undergraduate course in operating systems for computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering majors Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles provides a comprehensive and unified introduction to operating systems topics. Stallings emphasizes both design issues and fundamental principles in contemporary systems and gives readers a solid understanding of the key structures and mechanisms of operating systems. He discusses design trade-offs and the practical decisions affecting design, performance and security. The book illustrates and reinforces design concepts and ties them to real-world design choices through the use of case studies in Linux, UNIX, Android, and Windows 8. Teaching and Learning ExperienceThis program presents a better teaching and learning experience\u2013for you and your students. It will help: Illustrate Concepts with Running Case Studies: To illustrate the concepts and to tie them to real-world design choices that must be made, four operating systems serve as running examples. Easily Integrate Projects in your Course: This book provides an unparalleled degree of support for including a projects component in the course. Keep Your Course Current with Updated Technical Content: This edition covers the latest trends and developments in operating systems. Provide Extensive Support Material to Instructors and Students: Student and instructor resources are available to expand on the topics presented in the text",

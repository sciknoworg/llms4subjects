There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, What do a pharmaceutical, polymer and solid state chemist have in common? Organometallic chemistry of course, since progress in their diverse fields has at many times relied on this. It is a discipline which stands at the crossroads of so many branches of chemistry, with industrial applications ranging from the gram to megatonne scale. This book aims to introduce undergraduates to the utility of organotransition metal chemistry, a discipline of importance to scientists and technologists in a variety of industry sectors. The main focus will be on the reactivity of organometallic compounds of the transition metals, supported by discussion of structure and bonding and their implications. The aim, on completion of the course, is that a student will be equipped to recognize the key classes of organometallic compounds, their methods of characterization, possible synthetic routes and anticipated reactivity. Ideal for the needs of undergraduate chemistry students, Tutorial Chemistry Texts is a major series consisting of short, single topic or modular texts concentrating on the fundamental areas of chemistry taught in undergraduate science courses.  Each book provides a concise account of the basic principles underlying a given subject, embodying an independent-learning philosophy and including worked examples",

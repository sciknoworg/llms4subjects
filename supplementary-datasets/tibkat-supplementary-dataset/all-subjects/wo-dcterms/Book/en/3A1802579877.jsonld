            "abstract": "Kenya has experienced sustained economic growth over the past few years. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an average annual rate of 5.2 percent over the past 10 years (2007 to 2016). The rebasing of its national accounts in 2014 resulted in an upward revision of the country's GDP per capita and its re-classification as a lower middle-income country (LMIC). Kenya's economic prospects mean that the country is surpassing critical income eligibility thresholds for international financing and is bound to experience reduced international financing for its priority programs. This technical review analyzed the design and financing of five priority programs in Kenya (immunization, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV and AIDS), tuberculosis, malaria and reproductive health) in relation to their sustainability as Kenya transitions from a donor dependent country, to one that predominantly finances health through domestic resources. The review forms the first phase of work, which involves conducting a detailed analytical assessment and synthesis of a wide range of studies to assess the financing and delivery of immunization and other priority programs in Kenya. The report will serve as a one-stop-shop for the government, partners, and other stakeholders interested in sustainable financing and integration of vertical programs in health service delivery. The second phase of the work will draw on findings and recommendations from the first phase to support the national and county governments to implement interventions that will improve Kenya's readiness to transition its priority health programs towards being sustainably financed",

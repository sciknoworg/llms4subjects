            "abstract": "Mauritius's economy has grown dramatically since the country's independence in 1968, and its rapid development offers a powerful example for developing economies worldwide. However, growth dynamism has waned in recent years. In addition, Mauritius was hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and headwinds from Russia's war in Ukraine. Nevertheless, Mauritius has shown strong resilience, and with an economic recovery now well underway, the government has an opportunity to implement structural reforms to boost inclusive growth and sustainably regain high-income status. Reorienting the country's fiscal policy will be critical to this effort, to better align revenues and expenditures and to strengthen macroeconomic stability, which played a major role in Mauritius's economic success. Mauritius's transition to a knowledge-based economy will also require a robust competitive environment and sustained investment in human capital and innovation. This report identifies opportunities to enhance the impact of fiscal policy on macroeconomic stability and accelerate the transition toward greener, more resilient, and knowledge-based growth. The recommended reforms are designed to prioritize investment in productive assets while continuing to meet the social needs of an aging society in a cost-effective manner and strengthening resilience against climate change and other shocks. The report also identifies opportunities to leverage Mauritius's low-carbon growth potential in line with the focus of its most recent budgets",

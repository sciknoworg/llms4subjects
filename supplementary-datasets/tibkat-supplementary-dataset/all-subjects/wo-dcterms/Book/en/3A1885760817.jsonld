            "abstract": "Australia's 2022 federal election played out in ways that                    few could have expected. Not only did it bring a change of government; it also                    saw the lowest number of primary votes for the major parties and the election of                    the greatest number of Independents to the lower house since the formation of                    the Australian party system. The success of the Teal Independents and the                    Greens, along with the appetite voters showed for 'doing politics                    differently\u2019, suggested that the dominant model of electoral competition might                    no longer be the two-party system of Labor versus Liberal. At the very least,                    the continued usefulness of the two-party-preferred vote as a way of                    conceptualising and predicting Australians\u2019 voting behaviour has been cast into                    serious doubt. In Watershed, leading scholars analyse the election from the                    ground up\u2014focusing on the campaign issues, the actors involved, and the                    successes and failures of campaign strategy\u2014and show how digital media, visual                    politics and fake news are changing the way politics is done. Other topics                    include the impact of COVID-19 and the salience of climate, gender and integrity                    issues, as well as voting patterns and polling accuracy. This authoritative book                    is indispensable for understanding the disenchantment with the major parties,                    the rise of Community Independents, and the role of the Australian Greens and                    third parties. Watershed is the eighteenth in the ANU Press federal election                    series and the tenth sponsored by the Academy of the Social Sciences in                    Australia",

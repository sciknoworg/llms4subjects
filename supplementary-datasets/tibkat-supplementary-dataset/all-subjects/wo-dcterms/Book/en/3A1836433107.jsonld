            "abstract": "Tens of thousands of Eritreans make perilous voyages across Africa and the Mediterranean Sea every year. Why do they risk their lives to reach European countries where so many more hardships await them? By visiting family homes in Eritrea and living with refugees in camps and urban peripheries across Ethiopia, Sudan, and Italy, Milena Belloni untangles the reasons behind one of the most under-researched refugee populations today. Balancing encounters with refugees and their families, smugglers, and visa officers, The Big Gamble contributes to ongoing debates about blurred boundaries between forced and voluntary migration, the complications of transnational marriages, the social matrix of smuggling, and the role of family expectations, emotions, and values in migrants\u2019 choices of destinations. \u201cMilena Belloni\u2019s engrossing ethnography\u2014carried out across time, space, and place\u2014 is particularly commendable because of her scholarly commitment to \u2018getting things right.\u2019 The Eritrean women and men whose lives provided its empirical ground will see their pain, joy, and contradictions reflected back at them. This is scholar activism at its finest.\u201d LAURA BISAILLON, Professor of Health and Society, University of Toronto Scarborough \u201cThe Big Gamble is a study of a migrant group that has received very little scholarly attention. Its focus on the Eritrea to Europe corridor is a novel approach, and Milena Belloni has produced a compelling and courageous account.\u201d PETER KIVISTO, Augustana College and University of Helsinki \u201cA monumental and perceptive story of migration, taking the reader on a journey not just from Africa to Europe but through reflections on moralities, risk, and trust that are central to contemporary mobility and immobility. Belloni\u2019s account of Eritrean migration experiences is powered by formidable fieldwork and written with warmth and wisdom.\u201d J\u00d8RGEN CARLING, Peace Research Institute Oslo MILENA BELLONI is a sociologist at the University of Trento. Her doctoral research on Eritrean migration received the 2016 IMISCOE Award. Belloni has published in the Journal of Refugee Studies and the Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies",

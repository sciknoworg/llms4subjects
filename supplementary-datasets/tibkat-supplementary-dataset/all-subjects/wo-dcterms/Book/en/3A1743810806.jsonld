            "abstract": "The rapid development of China\u2019s transportation system brings huge challenges to fire safety issues. Fire Protection Engineering Applications for Large Transportation Systems in Chinaanalyzes key fire issues for large transportation systems in rail, airport, tunnels, etc. and offers solutions and best practices for similar projects throughout the world. The first monograph to look at transportation hub fire issues in China looks at architecture features, occupancy and area classification, fire hazard and design difficulties based on local code design. The book then provides case studies to identity the common problems and introduces possible solutions in order to develop a best practice for future design and improvement. The authors worked directly on the case studies provided, which include the Hongqiao airport transportation hub, Beijing and Pudoing airport PBD study, subways in different cities and the high speed train system Cross China. They use their research and investigation to form the theoretical basis for the fire design of urban large transportation hubs and the establishment of corresponding fire codes. The cutting-edge technologies discussed include: Smoke control strategy in complicated multiple function space, assistant evacuation performance based study new technology on fire separation new fire products for smoke detection and intelligent guiding system for evacuation BIM and internet of things used to improve fire management.",

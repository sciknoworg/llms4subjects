            "abstract": "The major issue of energy saving and conservation of the environment in the world is being emphasized to us to concentrate on lightweight materials in which aluminium alloys are contributing more in applications in the twenty-first century. Aluminium and its related materials possess lighter weight, considerable strength, more corrosion resistance and ductility. Especially from the past one decade, the use of aluminium alloys is increasing in construction field, transportation industries, packaging purposes, automotive, defence, aircraft and electrical sectors. Around 85% is being used in the form of wrought products, which replace the use of cast iron. Further, the major features of aluminium alloy are recyclability and its abundant availability in the world. In general, aluminium and its related materials are being processed via casting, drawing, forging, rolling, extrusion, welding, powder metallurgy process, etc. To improve the physical and mechanical properties, scientists are doing more research and adding some second-phase particles in to it called composites in addition to heat treatment. Therefore, to explore more in this field, the present book has been aimed and focused to bridge all scientists who are working in this field. The main objective of the present book is to focus on aluminium, its alloys and its composites, which include, but are not limited to, the various processing routes and characterization techniques in both macro- and nano-levels",

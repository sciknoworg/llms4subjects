            "abstract": "The Muna Consortium (Mediterranean and Middle East University Network Agreement) was founded in 2015 and renewed in 2021, when 30 Uni\u00adversities coming from all Countries of Mediterranean area and some others from Middle East signed the Fra\u00admework Agreement.  As written in the Framework Agreement, also in this Muna space in the CUCS Conference, we propo\u00adse three different main themes: MARE NOSTRUM (our Sea, the Mediterranean), PERSONA (Man) and ORBIS (the Earth), to summarize the proposals of Co\u00adoperation between Muna Network Universities. The first session is dedicated to the field of ORBIS to share the sustainability, through the biodiversity as a key ele\u00adment for the development of soil in different aspects as agricolture, fauna and flora sustainable management, with impact in the field of veterinary. Neverthless, a focus is also related to the inclusion and integration in the sustainable cities during this time of pandemia and migration flows with regard to the problem of clima changes in the Mediterranean area. The second session is focused on PERSONA, to share the experiences in the primary immunodefi\u00adciency inborn with the contributions of different Uni\u00adversities of different mediterranean area, examinating approaches of prevention and treatment, also thorough the proposal of a comparative study.  Culture differencies in this pandemia period and the situation of human rights in the medi\u00adterranean basin are discussed.  The last item is MARE NOSTRUM, foused on exploitation of the Mediterannean resources proposed by International Cooperations among Muna Partners. Besides the exploitation, the the\u00admes of improving the quality of water, the safe\u00adguarding of ittic sector and the mandatory better organization of port areas are further developed. In conclusion, a round table discusses the oppor\u00adtunities of the Cooperation, especially to understand which proposals can be followed in the Universities Cooperation and maybe to establish future projects",

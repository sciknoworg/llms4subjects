            "abstract": "This book mainly introduces an essential safety concept and procedure for electrical engineering in oil and gas field. It begins by providing broad guidelines for performing electrical safety and operability review (ELSOR), giving reader a general overview of the field. It subsequently verifies electrical distribution, overhead line and hazardous area classification safety analysis together with comparison of different international codes and standards with China national codes, to interpret different safety concepts from different countries for electrical engineering in oil and gas field. This unique and complete co-design safety analysis will greatly benefit international electrical engineers and operators of oil and gas fields. This book is with vivid flow chart, accurate table expressing the analysis logic method and exact illustrations of code and standard of different country and area. This book stresses the electrical design safety for surface facilities of oil and gas oil field and will benefit to engineer who works with oil and gas field surface facilities engineering.",

                "Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is toxic in nature. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, the safe limit of mercury ion in drinking water is 10 nM to avoid the serious health problems to humans. Mercury is a pollutant of global concern. Both anthropogenic activities and natural processes cause its release into different spheres of the environment resulting in severe adverse impacts. Increased anthropogenic discharge of mercury leads to disturbance in its natural biogeochemical cycle which results in to unenviable diseases and hazardous health effects. This book will provide state-of-the-art information to the graduate students training in toxicology, risk assessors, researchers and medical providers at large. Many monographs, book chapters, contemporary reviews, and peer reviewed articles about mercury health impact are also available worldwide. However, there is no complete understanding available on toxicological studies of mercury, which covers the broader spectrum of findings that range from sources of exposure to mercury toxicity as well as its remediation strategies. It is aimed to bring the readers updated information about the sources of mercury contamination, and its impact on human health and on prospective mitigation strategies through multi-disciplinary approaches. The book contains three sections. First section describes the different sources and distribution of mercury in the environment. Second section explains the health risks linked to mercury poisoning. Third section addresses sustainable mercury toxicity mitigation strategies through multi-disciplinary approaches. The key topic of this book will cover following: \u2022Source and distribution of mercury in the environment \u2022Effects and responses of mercury toxicity in plants \u2022 Health risk linked to mercury poisoning \u2022 Sustainable mercury toxicity mitigation strategies This book is a valuable resource to students, academics, researchers, and environmental professionals doing field work on mercury contamination throughout the world."

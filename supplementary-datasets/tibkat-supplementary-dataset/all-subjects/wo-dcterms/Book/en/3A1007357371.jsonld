                "The question of how to quantify the impact and value of research looms large in the minds of academics, policy makers, academic administrators, and scientists. Measuring Research: What Everyone Needs to Know\u00ae will provide, for the first time, an accessible account of these processes. Following a brief history of scholarly communication and its measurement, Cassidy R. Sugimoto and Vincent Larivi\u00e8re will look at the classification of knowledge, the role of peer review, emerging issues within the scholarly communication system, and potential changes for measuring research. This book provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the measurement of research and scholarly communication."

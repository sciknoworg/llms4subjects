            "title": "Body Blows : Six Performances",
            "abstract": "Hailed for his humor and passion, the internationally acclaimed performance artist Tim Miller has delighted, shocked, and emboldened audiences all over the world. Body Blows gathers six of Miller\u2019s best-known performances that chart the sexual, spiritual, and political topography of his identity as a gay man: Some Golden States, Stretch Marks, My Queer Body, Naked Breath, Fruit Cocktail, and Glory Box. In Body Blows, Tim Miller leaps from the stage to the page, as each performance script is illustrated with striking photographs and accompanied by Miller\u2019s notes and comment. This book explores the tangible body blows\u2014taken and given\u2014of Miller\u2019s life and times as explored in his performances: the queer-basher\u2019s blow, the sweet blowing breath of a lover, the below-the-belt blow of HIV/AIDS, the psychic blows from a society that disrespects the humanity of lesbian and gay relationships. Miller\u2019s performances are full of the put-up-your-dukes and stand-your-ground of such day-to-day blows that make up being gay in America",

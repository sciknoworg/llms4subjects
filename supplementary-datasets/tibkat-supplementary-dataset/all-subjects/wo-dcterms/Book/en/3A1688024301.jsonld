            "abstract": "This comprehensive resource provides theoretical formulation for detecting and geolocating non-cooperative emitters. Implementation of geolocation algorithms are discussed, as well as performance prediction of a hypothetical passive location system for systems analysis or vulnerability calculation. Comparison of novel direction finding and geolocation algorithms to classical forms are also included. Rooted in statistical signal processing and array processing theory, this book also provides an overview of the application of novel detection and estimation algorithms to real world problems in EW. The book is divided into three parts: detection, angle of arrival estimation, and geolocation. Each section begins with an introductory chapter covering the relevant signal processing theory (either detection or estimation), then provides a series of chapters covering specific methods to achieve the desired end-product. MATLAB\u00ae code is provided to assist readers with relevant probability and statistics, RF propagation, atmospheric absorption, and noise, giving readers an understanding of the implementation of the algorithms in the book, as well as developing new approaches to solving problems. Packed with problem sets and examples, this book strikes a balance between introductory texts and reference manuals, making it useful for novice as well as advanced practitioners",

                "This volume examines land and resource contestations in the East African Albertine region, where Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania intersect. It is one of the most biodiverse regions on the continent, and became highly contested when Uganda discovered oil there in 2006. The resource contestation in this region has resulted in ongoing conflict, and has defined and re-defined identity and citizenship. Contributors of this volume succinctly bring out the major forces that have been responsible for resource contestations and conflicts together with an emphasis on the existing mechanisms for peaceful co-existence, particularly in relation to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms within indigenous knowledge systems. John Mushomi holds a Doctoral of Philosophy in Population Studies and has over 14 years of research and policy practice experience in Population and Development. He is a Lecturer at the Department of Population Studies, Makerere University and currently holds a postdoctoral research and policy analysis fellowship at the African Institute for Development Policy (AFIDEP). Cori Wielenga is Associate Professor and Director of the Centre for Mediation in Africa at the University of Pretoria, South Africa."

            "abstract": "World Bank Group President David Malpass spoke about the world suffering from a dramatically uneven recovery, and inequality worsening across country groups. The highest priority is to secure access to vaccines and speed up shots in arms. He explained that the World Bank Group is working as hard as it can 24/7 to expand the number of doses as soon as it can get, and delivery schedules from the advanced economies and from the manufacturers. Regarding the IDA20 replenishment in December, African heads of state have already called for donors to be ambitious in their support for IDA's mission. He spoke about 1) making public spending more efficient in a country like Mexico; 2) climate finance provided to the developing countries should be doubled in the next few years; 3) opportunities presented by climate change and to support climate private sector investment in Africa; 4) the role of young people in global climate action; 5) boosting health systems and making them more resilient to shocks like COVID-19 in MENA region; 6) the pandemic impact on India's poor; 7) measures to save companies in difficulty during COVID-19; 8) lessons that developing countries draw from this health crisis, particularly on the social level; and 9) support to low-income countries efforts against pandemic",

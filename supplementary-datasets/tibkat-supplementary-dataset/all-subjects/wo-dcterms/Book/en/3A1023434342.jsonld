                "During the past decade, no industry has grown faster than that of mobile communications, yet coverage of its operations remains scarce. This state-of-the-art book examines the evolving structure and strategic behaviour of the thirty largest operators in the mobile communications industry. The focus of the book is on service providers, who are the primary interface between the industry and its users. The discussion gives emphasis to the most prominent operators and is divided into regions for ease of analysis. Prior to this, there is an examination of where these companies stand in relation to the FT500 largest companies in the world and an analysis of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) activity in the industry. The authors also provide a review of the latest wave of technology, known as Long Term Evolution (LTE). Through detailed case studies, the book demonstrates the complexity of the industry's structure and sheds light on such controversies as corporate taxation. Peter Curwen and Jason Whalley conclude with an overview of where the industry has been and more importantly, where it is going. This timely book will appeal to academics, practitioners and students with an interest in technology, telecommunications and business strategy",

                "Cancer is a major global public health problem. Among different environmental and lifestyle factors contributing to cancer risk, diet is a key one. On the one hand, obesity and increased consumption of red and processed meat, ethanol, sugar and saturated fatty acids are associated with increased cancer risk. On the other hand, consumption of micronutrients such as vitamin D, selenium, zinc, folate and bioactive compounds from fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk. Written by an influential, international team of experts, this book presents and discusses current topics on nutrition and cancer prevention. It covers both nutritional influences on different cancers plus specific chapters on the commonly occurring cancers. Nutritional genomics-based studies show that some dietary components modulate carcinogenesis through complex cellular and molecular mechanisms. A better understanding of these different cellular and molecular mechanisms is needed to establish efficient dietary recommendations for cancer prevention. This book will provide such an understanding, serving as an important book for all those working in nutritional health, food science and cancer research",

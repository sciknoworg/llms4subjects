                "Sport has the power to change the world. Sports Economics Uncut expresses this insight from Nelson Mandela, exploring sports as a fascinating mirror of the world and a powerful agent of change. In this book, Brian Goff covers subjects ranging from the ebb and flow of racial discrimination, to inequality, law enforcement, managers and risky decisions, club membership, and politics. Much more than merely a review or synthesis, this work extends existing perspectives and explores provocative questions such as: how systematic is racial bias in pro sports today? Is all racial segregation in sports due to racial bias? How much are college athletes really worth, and is league parity really optimal?  This book highlights the fascinating paradox of the modest revenues spent on sports but the enormous intangible value of it. The author explains how recent evidence of racial bias in sports actually illustrates how much ground has been gained in society on racial matters; how the scandals of college sports are a built-in feature of a world in which football and basketball athletes are worth millions; how athletic skill can vary widely across and within regions and races, and how this can influence positioning decisions; and how managers reflect both traditional economic views of decision making and more recent behavioral views.  While drawing from widespread academic studies, this is a lively presentation accessible to a wide audience, with extensive but easy to digest data. Students and scholars of sports economics, as well as those studying sports analysis or related areas, will find it an engaging and eye-opening read"

                "In a world of globalization and technological change, terrorism continues to pose grave threats not only to more traditional targets such as civilians and government targets, but according to many experts, increasingly to multinational corporations and other international economic enterprises. This book broadens the understanding of the threats posed to the private sector thereby helping business executives in charge of security affairs prepare for new threats and unconventional threats in a continuously evolving world. Chasdi's Terrorist Assault Business Vulnerability Index (TABVI) now provides C-class executives with a way to measure (potential) host country and host country industry vulnerability and thus contributes a critical new standard to help appraise where and when MNCs and other international enterprises should marshal Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and other resources. In addition, his statistical findings about different country operational environments work to frame TABVI findings and provide in-depth understandings of risk in several different (potential) host countries. While the focus is on traditional terrorist groups and criminal syndicalist organizations that use terrorism in particular developing world host countries, Chasdi's research also informs the business community about the context of political issues of contention defined by terrorist groups and their constituent supporters. Business leaders, government officials at national and local government levels, the academic community, and the media benefit from ideas proposed in this book. Brian M. Jenkins writes a carefully reasoned, comprehensive, and insightful Foreword that describes the importance of this topic; about Chasdi, he writes, \"...I am an admirer of his uniquely imaginative approaches and always rigorous analysis. His work is invariably intellectually challenging and thought provoking. Read on.\"."

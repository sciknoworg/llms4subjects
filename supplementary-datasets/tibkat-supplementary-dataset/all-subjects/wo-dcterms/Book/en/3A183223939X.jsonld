The issue consists of fourteen studies, of which the majority were on DCM, the more common pathology, while three studies focused on tSCI. This issue includes two narrative reviews, three systematic reviews and nine original research papers. Areas of research covered include image studies, predictive modeling, prognostic factors, and multiple systemic or narrative reviews on various aspects of these conditions. These articles include the contributions of a diverse group of researchers with various approaches to studying SCI coming from multiple countries, including Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States",

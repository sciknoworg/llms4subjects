            "abstract": "This book offers teaching/training professionals an evidence-based pedagogic guide to teaching effectively, efficiently and creatively \u2013 also known as Creative Teaching Competence. Firstly it summarizes the extensive research on human psychological functioning relating to learning and how this can be fully utilized in the design and facilitation of quality learning experiences that maximize attainment and engagement opportunities. Secondly, it demonstrates what creativity actually \u2018looks like\u2019 in terms of specific teaching practices, modeling the underpinning processes (syntax) of creative learning design. It then establishes Metacognitive Capability as the superordinate twenty-first century competency; in that this unique human attribute can significantly enhance the cognitive and motivational strategies essential for facilitating self-directed learning and wellbeing. The book helps teaching/training professionals to thoughtfully apply evidence-based knowledge and strategies to today\u2019s challenges, such as developing self-directed learners, enhancing intrinsic motivation, utilizing technology for learning and teaching, developing curricula for twenty-first century competencies and optimally framing and developing the heightened teacher expertise required today.",

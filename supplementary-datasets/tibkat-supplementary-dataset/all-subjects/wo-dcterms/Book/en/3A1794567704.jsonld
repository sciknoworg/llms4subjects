            "abstract": "Development of new drug molecules is costly and requires longitudinal, wide-ranging studies; therefore, designing advanced pharmaceutical formulations for existing and well-known drugs seems to be an attractive device for the pharmaceutical industry. Properly formulated drug delivery systems can improve pharmacological activity, efficacy and safety of the active substances. Advanced materials applied as pharmaceutical excipients in designing drug delivery systems can help solve problems concerning the required drug release\u2014with the defined dissolution rate and at the determined site. Novel drug carriers enable more effective drug delivery, with improved safety and with fewer side effects. Investigations concerning advanced materials represent a rapidly growing research field in material/polymer science, chemical engineering and pharmaceutical technology. Exploring novel materials or modifying and combining existing ones is now a crucial trend in pharmaceutical technology. Eleven articles included in the the Special Issue \u201cAdvanced Materials in Drug Release and Drug Delivery Systems\u201d present the most recent insights into the utilization of different materials with promising potential in drug delivery and into different formulation approaches that can be used in the design of pharmaceutical formulations",

            "abstract": "This Fourth Edition brings the reader up to date on gas technologies and equipment that have evolved since the Third Edition was published in 1990. It is both a comprehensive overview and a source reference for supplementary data on every aspect of handling gases in compressed, liquefied, and cryogenic forms. Properties, safety considerations, equipment, and regulations relevant to compressed gases are all addressed. The Fourth Edition gives information relating to current standards from the various standards developing organizations in the field, as well as the latest shipping requirements, storage and handling procedures and uses. The Fourth Edition of Handbook of Compressed Gases is the only compressed gas reference that combines gas-specific information on 66 compressed gases, including physical constants, handling, storage and transportation, and safety requirements as well as comprehensive, detailed information on valves and pressure relief devices, cylinder maintenance, bulk containers and transportation, and oxygen cleaning. The handbook has been reformatted to present information in a more ordered, logical sequence, using specific labeling and marking information to make the Fourth Edition even more useful than its predecessor. This new edition includes: The latest changes in DOT regulations (HM-206, HM-215A, HM-215B), Exposure limits set by ACGIH and OSHA which have been reviewed and updated, New developments in safety equipment, along with the latest training requirements to mitigate a compressed gas incident. Since this handbook is not product-specific, it contains coverage of gases across the spectrum of the industry - not just those produced by one manufacturer. It is a ready source of useful information on natural gases, refrigerants, medical gases, atmospheric gases, and equipment and systems for oxygen service. All professionals whose work includes the manufacture, handling, or use of gas will find the Fourth Edition of Handbook of Compressed Gases extremely valuable. It serves the needs of engineers, technicians, researchers, maintenance personnel, health specialists, transportation directors, purchasing agents, hazardous materials officials, and chemical handlers",

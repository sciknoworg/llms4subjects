                "\"Takes a close look at spaces that reformulate the idea of what home means, in innovative houses in cities around the globe. Showcases recent projects that represent the vanguard of architects creating innovative spaces for living in the twenty-first century. Dan Rubinstein and the editors of the Amsterdam-based magazine have selected projects on five continents that will shape how we think of domestic life for a long time to come. Where the great experimenters of the last century were stripping away ornamentation and creating free-flowing spaces for the first time, today's pioneers are researching the potential of new materials and techniques to push the boundaries of environmental sustainability, as well as creating new forms and bold, sophisticated explorations in the adaptive reuse of spaces originally designed for any number of other purposes. This Is Not a House presents the latest built residential projects by such design luminaries as Sou Fujimoto, Plasma Studio, and Michael Maltzan, as well as emerging ones such as Johan Selbing, among others, in an array of locations across the globe, including New York, London, Los Angeles, and Tokyo.\" --Publisher",

                "\"School is supposed to be the great equalizer in America, though we know it often doesn't work as it should. In fact, when it comes to understanding schools and inequality, especially in K-12 schools, the more common view is that American schools actually increase inequality. This assumption has become such a strongly held belief in our society that our schools (especially poor ones) have become a punching bag for political candidates, pundits, and concerned citizens. In this book, Douglas B. Downey puts these widespread ideas to the test, finding that the numbers offer an important corrective to our understanding of schools' effects on inequality. Schools do not exacerbate inequality, Downey shows-they actually help to level the playing field. Achievement gaps in math and reading skills are mostly formed prior to kindergarten entry, and schools do more to reduce them than increase them. We spend so much time and energy trying to reduce inequality via school reform, but it clearly starts too late, after most of the \"action\" has already occurred; the real sources of inequality are elsewhere. Downey's book is an essential call to action: if we are serious about building a more just society, we are going to have to fight some battles bigger than school reform and get at the roots of inequality once and for all\"--",

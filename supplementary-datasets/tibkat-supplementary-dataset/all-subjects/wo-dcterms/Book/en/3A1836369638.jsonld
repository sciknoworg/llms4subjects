            "abstract": "In a 1917 letter to Gershom Scholem, Walter Benjamin writes, \u201cTheory is like a surging sea.\u201d This small book takes more than its title from that line\u2014it takes that line as a point of departure in Erich Auerbach\u2019s sense, an Ansatzpunkt, as a compositional principle so that what follows can be read in its entirety as a gloss on the remainder of Benjamin\u2019s sentence: \u201cTheory is like a surging sea, but the only thing that matters to the wave [\u2026] is to surrender itself to its motion in such a way that it crests and breaks.\u201d That motion, in the pages to follow, takes up in its sweep two threads: it folds an episodic meditation on the negative and the problematic into a series of singular interrogations exemplary of the positive being of the problematic, the objective being of problems and questions, in a movement of implication and explication between poetry and philosophy in the tradition of what\u2019s come to be known as theory. Theory is like a surging sea because it\u2019s as part of a revolutionary tradition that it crests and breaks",

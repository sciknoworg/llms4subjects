            "abstract": "The present book contains 14 papers published in the Special Issue \u201cDifferential Geometry\u201d of the journal Mathematics. They represent a selection of the 30 submissions. This book covers a variety of both classical and modern topics in differential geometry. We mention properties of both rectifying and affine curves, the geometry of hypersurfaces, angles in Minkowski planes, Euclidean submanifolds, differential operators and harmonic forms on Riemannian manifolds, complex manifolds, contact manifolds (in particular, Sasakian and trans-Sasakian manifolds), curvature invariants, and statistical manifolds and their submanifolds (in particular, Hessian manifolds). We wish to mention that among the authors, there are both well-known geometers and young researchers. The authors are from countries with a tradition in differential geometry: Belgium, China, Greece, Japan, Korea, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey, and United States of America. Many of these papers were already cited by other researchers in their articles. This book is useful for specialists in differential geometry, operator theory, physics, and information geometry as well as graduate students in mathematics",

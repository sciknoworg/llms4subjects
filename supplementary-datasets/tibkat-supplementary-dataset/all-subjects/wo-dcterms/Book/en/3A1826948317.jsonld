            "abstract": "\"This new volume offers a variety of perspectives from investigators, industry professionals, stakeholders, and economic strategists that look at new ways of solving optimization problems related to different industrial sectors. Case studies relay how optimization methods deal with both real operative conditions in process industries and in service industries. The volume also explores emerging research areas toward the implementation of optimization algorithms for enhancement of system performance as well as system effectiveness. The book explores the role of optimization methods in engineering applications in industrial and mechanical engineering as well as in the fields of healthcare/medicine, food production, oil, textiles, energy, and agriculture. The volume offers new ways of solving optimization problems related to different industrial sectors, incorporating mathematical formulation for particular design problems and thus aiding the selection of the optimal design among many alternatives. It shows optimization methods that deal with actual operative conditions both in process and in service industries. A unique advantage of this volume is its wide range of topics in different engineering domains using novel mathematical modeling-based optimization methods for solving the real-life problems. The array of examples and case studies of the effective use of optimization in diverse areas of engineering include healthcare analysis and monitoring (fetal phonocardiography), medical device design (3D printing design for protheses), agriculture/farming (monitoring climate conditions), environmental science (waste management), automotive and aeronautic design, industrial manufacturing, solar energy, and more\"--",

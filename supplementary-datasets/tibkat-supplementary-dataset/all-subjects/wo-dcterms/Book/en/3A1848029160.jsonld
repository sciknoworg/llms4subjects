            "abstract": "\"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused serious disruptions to the economy and business activities. The COVID-19 crisis has also exposed important weaknesses in business and supply chains. It pointed to specific sectors of the economy, primarily related to services, that suffered the most. On the other hand, it has highlighted the great flexibility of the activities of entrepreneurs in their attempts to fight the crisis. The role of government has also been important in tackling this pandemic crisis to contain the epidemic and adopt activities to help entrepreneurs who were most affected by the crisis. Numerous national aid and recovery packages have been announced to support businesses and workers. At the same time, financial decisions were made at the international level; the effect of this was the mobilization of huge funds that were intended to support the functioning of enterprises. This book shares observations and conclusions from contemporary research and analyses, as well as from personal experiences in creating and implementing anti-crisis solutions in economies and enterprises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and its entities. It will be of interest to researchers, academics, policymakers, and students in the fields of international business, economics, crisis management, and entrepreneurship.\"",

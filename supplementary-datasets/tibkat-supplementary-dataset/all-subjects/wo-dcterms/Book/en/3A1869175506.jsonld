            "abstract": "Transportation is one of the most crucial aspects across the world, supporting the daily life of human beings and the sustainable development of the whole of society. Generally, meteorology causes various impacts on transportation operation, safety and efficiency. In the context of global warming, increasing numbers of extreme weather and climate events (such as fog, icy roads, and extreme winds) have been detected worldwide and are expected to occur more frequently in the future. Meanwhile, extreme events, such as dense fog, rainstorm, and blizzard, tend to damage transportation and traffic facilities (such as express ways, port, airport, and high-speed railway) and induce serious traffic blocks and accidents. In recent decades, concentrated and continuous efforts have been made to carry out meteorological analyses regardless of urban traffic or transportation conditions, including those of highways, shipping, aviation, etc. A number of methods and techniques have been intensively developed to promote the qualities of both observations and forecasts. More recently, state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks have also been widely introduced into studies regarding transportation meteorology and many other fields",

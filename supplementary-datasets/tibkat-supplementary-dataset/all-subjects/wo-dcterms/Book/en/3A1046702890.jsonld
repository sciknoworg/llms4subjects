            "abstract": "The career and family outcomes of college graduate women suggest that the twentieth century contained five distinct  cohorts.' Each cohort made choices concerning career and family subject to different constraints. The first cohort, graduating college from the beginning of the twentieth century to the close of World War I, had either  family or career.' The second, graduating college from around 1920 to the end of World War II, had  job then family.' The third cohort   the college graduate mothers of the baby boom'   graduated college from around 1946 to the mid-1960s and had  family then job.' The fourth cohort graduated college from the late 1960s to the late 1970s. Using the NLS Young Women I demonstrate that 13 to 18 percent achieved  career then family' by age 40. The objective of the fifth cohort, graduating from around 1980 to 1990, has been  career and family,' and 21 to 28 percent (using the NLS Youth) have realized that goal by age 40. I trace the demographic and labor force experiences of these five cohorts of college graduates and discuss why  career and family' outcomes changed over time",

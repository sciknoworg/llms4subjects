            "abstract": "\"This book provides a novel exploration of the application of nanofiltration membrane technology for sustainability in various industries, situated in view of recent breakthroughs and the use of reuse, recycle and resource recovery approaches. Moving from a comprehensive discussion of nanofiltration membrane processes to case studies and real-world applications of nanofiltration technology across society, both successes and potential limitations are considered. Features: Detailed discussion of the fundamentals of nanofiltration technology. The concepts of reuse, recycle and resource recovery using nanofiltration technology are explored in combination with other technologies to advance circular economy. Considered across a range of industries, from textiles, oil, gas, agriculture, pharmaceutical and many more. Written in a thoroughly detailed manner, this book is an essential guide for industry professionals interested in sustainability and working towards a circular economy. Comprehensive discussions of the fundamental processes underpinning nanofiltration technology also make this book particularly appealing to students of industrial chemistry\"--",

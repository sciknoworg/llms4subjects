            "abstract": "Since the late 1990s, an essential shift has taken place in the pattern of private sector financial flows to developing countries. Debt flows have fallen sharply, while equity flows--primarily in the form of foreign direct investment--have remained comparatively robust. The shift from debt to equity ought to diminish the volatility of developing countries' external finance and improve their access to technology, markets, and management expertise. However, much more needs to be done to put development finance on a stable basis. Global Development Finance 2003 is unique in its depth of coverage of the issues related to international development finance. By putting all development-related flows in a consistent framework, the publication will allow government officials, economists, investors, financial consultants, academics, bankers, and the entire development community to better understand, manage, and promote the key challenges of financing development. Global Development Finance 2003, I: Analysis and Statistical Appendix is the World Bank's annual review of recent trends in and prospects for financial flows to developing countries. It also contains the World Bank's projections of the global outlook in view of the current global geopolitical uncertainties. Global Development Finance 2003, II: Summary and Country Tables includes a comprehensive set of tables with statistical data for 138 countries that report debt under the World Bank Debtor Reporting System, as well as summary data for regions and income groups. It contains data on total external debt stocks and flows, aggregates, and key debt ratios, and provides a detailed, country-by-country picture of debt",

            "title": "The education triple cocktail : System-wide instructional reform in South Africa",
            "abstract": "The education triple cocktail brings together rigorous quantitative and qualitative research on a new approach to improving foundational teaching and learning for schoolchildren living in working-class, poor and remote rural communities in resource-constrained systems like South Africa. At the core of this book is the theory and evidence for a powerful, new, interlocking and mutually reinforcing change model. Inspired by the AIDS treatment story, the approach brings together structured daily lesson plans, appropriate and high-quality educational materials, and one-on-one instructional coaching to help teachers transform their instructional practices in early grade classrooms and thereby improve learning outcomes. For education systems defined by low levels of early grade learning and profoundly unequal outcomes, The education triple cocktail offers a theoretically informed, evidence-based way forward. This book will be of immense use to teachers, students of Education, policymakers and parents",

                "\"In today's digital world, unrestricted 'open' access to information and new ideas are our society's most valuable resource. Openness in the scholarly and research environment--broadly considered as open scholarship--is quickly becoming recognised as a fundamental principle for academic research. Offering new insights into promising ways to facilitate the uptake of open scholarship in the humanities, this book gives further shape to the digital humanities and the prospects of their future as part of a far more open and public world of scholarship. The book begins with the history of digital developments and their influence on the founding of international policies toward open scholarship. The concept of making research more freely available to the broader community, in practice, will require changes across every part of the system: government agencies, funders, university administrators, publishers, libraries, researchers and IT developers. To this end, the book sheds light on the urgent need for partnership and collaboration between diverse stakeholders to address multi-level barriers to both the policy and practical implementation of open scholarship. It also highlights the specific challenges confronted by the humanities which often makes their presentation in accessible open formats more costly and complex. Finally, the authors illustrate some promising international examples and ways forward for their implementation. The book ends by asking the reader to view their role as a researcher, university administrator, or member of government or philanthropic funding body, through new lenses. It highlights how, in our digital era, the frontiers through which knowledge is being advanced and shared can reshape the landscape for academic research to have the greatest impact for society\"--",

            "abstract": "Inequalities appear in various fields of natural science and engineering. Classical inequalities are still being improved and/or generalized by many researchers. That is, inequalities have been actively studied by mathematicians. In this book, we selected the papers that were published as the Special Issue \u2018\u2019Inequalities\u2019\u2019 in the journal Mathematics (MDPI publisher). They were ordered by similar topics for readers\u2019 convenience and to give new and interesting results in mathematical inequalities, such as the improvements in famous inequalities, the results of Frame theory, the coefficient inequalities of functions, and the kind of convex functions used for Hermite\u2013Hadamard inequalities. The editor believes that the contents of this book will be useful to study the latest results for researchers of this field",

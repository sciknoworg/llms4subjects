                "A distinct Anglo-Jewish identity developed in Britain between 1840 and 1880. Over the course of these forty years, a mature, increasingly comfortable, native-born Jewish community emerged and matured in London. The multifaceted growth and change in communal institutional and religious structures and habits, as well as the community\u2019s increasing familiarity and comfort with the larger English society, contributed to the formation of an Anglo-Jewish communal identity. The history of this community and the ways in which it developed are explored in this volume using archival and also contemporary advertising material that appeared in the Jewish Chronicle and other Anglo-Jewish newspapers in these years",

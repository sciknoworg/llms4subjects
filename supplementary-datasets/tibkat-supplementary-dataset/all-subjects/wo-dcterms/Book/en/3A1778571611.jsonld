            "title": "Fault Diagnosis and Detection",
            "abstract": "Mass production companies have become obliged to reduce their production costs and sell more products with lower profit margins in order to survive in competitive market conditions. The complexity and automation level of machinery are continuously growing. This development calls for some of the most critical issues that are reliability and dependability of automatic systems. In the future, machines will be monitored remotely, and computer-aided techniques will be employed to detect faults in the future, and also there will be unmanned factories where machines and systems communicate to each other, detect their own faults, and can remotely intercept their faults. The pioneer studies of such systems are fault diagnosis studies. Thus, we hope that this book will contribute to the literature in this regard",

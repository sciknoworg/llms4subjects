            "abstract": "For more than a decade, Stephen Prata's C Primer Plus has been one of the world's most popular and respected guides to learning C as a first programming language: more than half a million copies have been sold worldwide. Instructors, students, and self-taught learners have each praised this book for its logical organization and thoroughness, carefully crafted examples and exercises, and exceptionally clear explanations of some of the most problematic areas of C programming.Now, Prata has thoroughly updated this classic guide to: * Fully reflect the new C11 standard, with refreshed code examples and exercises throughout * Emphasize platform-independent C programming, linking its directions to free, open-source C compilers instead of proprietary IDEs * Present new content on C programming for modern mobile and game development * Introduce C-based object-oriented languages, including Apple's Objective-C * Address features including extended integer types, compound literals, expanded character support, designated initializers, Boolean support, expanded computational support, variable-length arrays, and inline functions As with previous editions, C Primer Plus offers broad coverage that begins with a crystal-clear introduction to the fundamentals of C programming. Prata carefully covers variables, data types, arithmetic expressions, program looping, making decisions, arrays, functions, structures, character strings, pointers, bit operations, preprocessing, I/O, and more.His concise examples and well-designed exercises deliver step-by-step, hands-on experience that begins with simple tasks and gradually builds to more complex, professional-quality techniques. Prata also points out common programming mistakes, helping learners build more robust and reliable code from the very beginning.",

            "abstract": "Gottfried Semper (1803\u20131879) left behind a voluminous legacy of architectural-theory writings. The manner, in his works, in which he analyzed architecture from a cultural-historical perspective as the key discipline in human artistry continues to exert a deep fascination up until today. The London Writings make available previously unpublished or little-known texts originating during Semper\u2019s exile in London (1850\u20131855) in a critical and commented edition, including in their original wordings. Swayed by his impressions of the first Great Exhibition of 1851 and as a lecturer at the Department of Practical Art, it was in London that Semper laid the foundations for his theoretical magnum opus Der Stil (Style, 1860/63). He counterpoised the phenomena of the globalized flow of merchandise and a globalization of knowledge that he observed with his thoughts on the global development of architectural culture in all its manifold material, social and political conditions",

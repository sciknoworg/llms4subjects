            "abstract": "The induction motor is one of the most significant innovations in contemporary history and it officially kicked off the Second Industrial Revolution by significantly enhancing energy generation efficiency. Induction motors are utilized in a wide variety of applications in the modern industrial world. Motivated by the importance of recent advances, new perspectives, and applications of induction motors, this book presents research from distinguished experts in the field. It addresses recent advances in induction motors, optimal solutions in field-oriented control, the association of converters to induction motors, dynamic analysis, optimized design of synergetic control, fault-tolerant control, mathematical modeling, an adaptive system scheme for a sensorless drive, modeling, and simulation of a system with inter-turn faults, sensorless speed observer for industrial drives, and induction motor applications in electric vehicles. This book is useful for undergraduates, graduate students, researchers, professors, and field engineers due to its combination of both theoretical coverage and real-world application concepts",

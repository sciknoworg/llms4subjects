It was in the 1970s that Jock Lauterer, a photographer turned builder, joined six other families on a 300 acre homesteading community in the Southern Appalachian mountain range. He documented his experience through pictures and vivid descriptions of the process of building \u201cOld Tom,\u201d the house that eventually housed him and his family",

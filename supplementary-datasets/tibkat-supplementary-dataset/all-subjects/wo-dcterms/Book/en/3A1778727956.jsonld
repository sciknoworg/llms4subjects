            "abstract": "From the beginning it was a key priority of the first president of the Federal Republic of Germany to reply personally to many of the hundreds of letters he received every day from individual citizens. In Heuss' correspondence with them, important themes of postwar society in the context of collapse and reconstruction, restoration and new beginning are evident. Heuss' letters were friendly in tone and written specifically to each individual. Often quite humorous, they sometimes tended to be lecturesome and contentious. The letters provide insight into how Heuss perceived his office, and his stance set an example for his successors. Contains letters from citizens and Heuss' replies As political dialogue between individual citizens and the first president of the Federal Republic of Germany , the correspondence provides insight into German postwar society",

A game-changer in Brownian temp-controlled phoneme capture, \u03c1an-\u03c1an\u2019s writhing paginations are completely oxygen-soaked, overwriting the flavour profiles of 2013\u2019s thN Lng folk 2go with no-holds-barred argumentations on all voice-like and lung-adjacent functions. Rumoured by experts to be dead to the World\u2122, CoN has clearly turned its ear canal arrays towards the jabbering OMFG feedback signals from their scores of naive listeners, scrapping all lenticular exegesis and content profiles to construct taped-together vernacular dwellings housing \u2018shrooming atmospheric awarenesses and pan-dimensional cross-talkers, making this anticipatory sequel a serious competitor across ambient markets, and a crowded kitchen in its own right.  An utterly mondegreen-infested deep end may deter would-be study buddies from taking the plunge, but feet-wetted Dog Heads eager to sniff around for temporal folds and whiff past the stank of hastily proscribed future fogs ought to \u00a9k no further than the roll-upable-rim of \u03c1an-\u03c1an\u2019s bleeeeeding premodern lagoon. Arrange yerself cannonball-wise or lead with the #gut and you\u2019ll be kersplashing in no times.\"",

            "abstract": "\"Incisive and forward-thinking in its approach, this prescient book investigates the conditions of the often unstable school-to-work transition (SWT) period, calling for an improvement in labour market entry processes in order to facilitate the smooth integration of school leavers into employment. School-to-Work Transition in Comparative Perspective captures the complex nature of SWTs by proposing and evaluating a new set of metrics which can act as a composite indicator of early employment security. Case studies in the form of biographies from individuals who have experienced turbulent transitions are then analysed in order to outline potential lessons from these lived experiences. Through detailed multi-disciplinary study, the book delivers a cross-country comparative assessment of the SWT period, providing new insights into the complex and dynamic nature of this transition process. It further examines what models of SWT are present in post-socialist countries, with a specific focus on Central and Eastern European states. This compelling book will be an important read for students, academics and researchers in the fields of sociology and social policy, labour policy, welfare states, education and economics. Its presentation of new measures through which to evaluate the SWT period will also greatly benefit professionals and practitioners working in education, labour policy and welfare states\"--",

            "abstract": "The application of dynamic positioning (DP) systems has been expanded significantly not only in the number of DP vessels, but also in the range of applications and the advancement of DP technologies. In order to address various needs of the industry, the majority of leading Classification Societies (Class) have developed Class specific guidance relating to development, implementation, and use of dynamic positioning Systems (DP). This book provides generalised guidance adapted from various leading Classes, to provide DP professionals with a readily available source of information and guidance relating to the operation and use of DP systems. The book provides optional notations and technical specifics that reflect current industry practice and DP technologies. This book includes guidance relating to: \u2022 Enhanced system (EHS) notations to recognise design features beyond current DPS-series notations and to provide flexibility to owners and operators. \u2022 Station keeping performance (SKP) notations to recognise DP capability and to encourage robust design of the DP systems. \u2022 Increased level of detail on the technical requirements to help less experienced users.",

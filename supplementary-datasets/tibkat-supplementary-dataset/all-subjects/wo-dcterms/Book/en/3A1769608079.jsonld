                "\"Networked Control System (NCS) can be regarded as a special type of control system in which sensors, controllers and actuators are connected to a closed loop. Media-sharing characteristics, time-delay, data packet dropout and data displacement are inevitable phenomena in such a control system, which can greatly degrade the control performance, and even make the control system unstable. Alleviating these effects has become one of the most attractive research hotspots in the last two decades. All the above three problems can be summarized as the time-delay issue. There are two kinds of time-delay compensation strategies: one is active compensation, and the other is passive compensation. For the former, prediction is the core idea. Selecting the appropriate candidate predicted control action according to the time delay information is a feasible solution. For the latter, making the system insensitive to delay is a good choice. This book covers the design, modeling, control, simulation and application of the networked control system. This book addresses some original contributions reporting the latest advances in networked control. It aims to gather the latest research on state-of-the-art methods, simulations and applications of networked control techniques. The editor hopes it can reveal some tendencies in this research field and benefit readers including professional researchers and students. This is an interesting collection of networked control techniques, such as date-based control, tracking control, event-triggered control, formation control, etc\"--"

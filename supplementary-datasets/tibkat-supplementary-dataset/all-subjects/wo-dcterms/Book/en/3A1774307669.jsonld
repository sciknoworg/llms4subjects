            "abstract": "Benefiting from successful economic transformation after independence and the start of EU accession negotiations, economic activity in Montenegro has been solid, supporting the rise in incomes their convergence with the ones in the European Union. Inflation has been modest and kept in check. However, the import dependence of the growth model and the excessive reliance on the state to stimulate the economy have contributed to widening of external and internalimbalances as well as indebtedness. There have been recent efforts at fiscal tightening, but more needs to be done to address structural rigidities and boost the commitment to the objectives of economic policies. This is particularly the case with respect to the medium-term budget plans, public sector restructuring, pension and health reforms, improvements of market competition, and the labor market. Montenegro confronts today the need for further fiscal adjustment to turn the deficit into surplus and bring public debt below the Maastricht level. This would help creating the fiscal space for strengthening its convergence prospects with the EU and with the alignment with the rules in the eurozone, given the country's use of euro as the local currency. Fiscal and structural policies in an economy without monetary policy levers are of paramount importance to protect stability and competitiveness. This Public Finance Synthesis Report is a summary of policy discussions over the last few years carried out under the various World Bank activities, including the Policy-Based Guarantee, the analytical work under the topic of Jobs and Growth and on pharmaceutical reform issues). While the Government has already taken major efforts to address some of the critical bottlenecks in the economy, this synthesis report summarizes and outlines pathways to further strengthen the sustainability, efficiency, and effectiveness of public finances in Montenegro",

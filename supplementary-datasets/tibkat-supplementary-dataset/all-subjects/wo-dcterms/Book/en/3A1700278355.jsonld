            "abstract": "\"A worldwide communication technology revolution has taken place in the last 20 years which has created a high demand in Industry for graduates with in depth expertise in communication engineering techniques and a sound and complete understanding of their core principles. This is the timely second edition of the highly successful Communication Engineering Principles (CEP), first published in 2001 and adopted as a core textbook for teaching in many universities in the UK and abroad. Primarily intended for a first undergraduate degree course in Communication Engineering, CEP also proved to be an excellent background reading material on a range of MSc courses related to Telecommunication Engineering (e.g., Mobile Communication, Satellite Communication, Optical Communication, Electronics, Computer Systems, etc.) and to be suitable for practicing engineers, media technology professionals and technical managers wishing to update their knowledge of the subject. Topics covered include, Overview of communication systems, Time domain analysis of signals and systems, Frequency domain analysis of signals and systems, Transmission Media, Antennas, Noise in communication systems, Amplitude modulation, Frequency and phase modulation, Sampling, Digital baseband coding, Digital modulation, Pulse shaping and detection in noise and distortion, Multiplexing and multiple access, Communication link design\"--",

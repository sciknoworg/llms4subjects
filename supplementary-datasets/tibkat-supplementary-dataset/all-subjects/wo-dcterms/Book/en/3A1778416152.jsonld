            "abstract": "Sensors are the eyes or/and ears of an intelligent system, such as UAV, AGV and robots. With the development of material, signal processing, and multidisciplinary interactions, more and more smart sensors are proposed and fabricated under increasing demands for homes, the industry, and military fields. Networks of sensors will be able to enhance the ability to obtain huge amounts of information (big data) and improve precision, which also mirrors the developmental tendency of modern sensors. Moreover, artificial intelligence is a novel impetus for sensors and networks, which gets sensors to learn and think and feed more efficient results back. This book includes new research results from academia and industry, on the subject of \u201cSmart Sensors and Networks\u201d, especially sensing technologies utilizing Artificial Intelligence. The topics include: smart sensors biosensors sensor network sensor data fusion artificial intelligence deep learning mechatronics devices for sensors applications of sensors for robotics and mechatronics devices",

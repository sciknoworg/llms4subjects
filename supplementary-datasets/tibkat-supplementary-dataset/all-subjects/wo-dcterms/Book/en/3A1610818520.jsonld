The objectives that constitute the specified goal may be in terms of time, cost, or technical results. A project can be simple or complex. In each case, proven project management processes must be followed. In all cases of project management implementation, control must be exercised to assure that project objectives are achieved. This book fills the void that exists in the application of statistical techniques to project control. Although the book is designed as a practical guide for project management professionals, it will also appeal to students, researchers, and instructors. It is applicable to several programs including Industrial Engineering, Systems Engineering, Construction Engineering, Operations Research, Engineering Management, Business Management, General Management, Business Administration, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Production Management, Industrial Management, and Operations Management.

Statistical Techniques for Project Control seamlessly integrates qualitative and quantitative tools and techniques for project control. It fills the void that exists in the application of statistical techniques to project control.The book begins by defining the fundamentals of project management then explores how to temper quantitative analysis with qualitative human judgment that makes project control nebulous but also offers opportunities to innovate and be creative in achieving control. The authors then discuss the three factors (time, budget, and performance) that form the basis of the operating characteristics of a project that also help determine the basis for project control. They then focus on computational network techniques for project schedule (time) control.Although designed as a practical guide for project management professionals, the book also appeals to students, researchers, and instructors. \"--",

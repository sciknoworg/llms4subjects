Anyone interested in Serverless architecture will benefit from this book, regardless of their level of technical understanding. This revised and expanded new edition explains many related terms, such as microservices, cloud-native, architecture, several relevant AWS services, and how it all works together to produce cost-effective, scalable solutions in the cloud. The book starts at a high level and gradually gets more in-depth and technical. The less technical decision maker will learn how Serverless can affect finance, security, people, and compliance. The book touches on important decisions, such as selecting and working with external or internal specialists and teams; finding, evaluating, and training them; and the flexibility and dynamics available within digital projects. Deployment automation and DevOps also feature heavily in this book, and you will find real-world use cases and examples of Serverless architecture to get you started. It's worth noting that this book is not a development guide; it gives you a comprehensive understanding of what Serverless is so you can make informed decisions for your organization and projects. What You\u2019ll Learn Understand Serverless architecture and strategy Understand modern cloud management strategy, governance, and organizational team structure Handle budget planning and management Get started with Serverless architecture design Gain knowledge of best practices and security, as well as data management and DevOps Study proactive logging, operations, architecture examples, case studies, and more."

The second section focuses on novel sensors based on these emerging MEMS/NEMS fabrication methods, and their related applications in industrial, biomedical, and environmental monitoring fields, which makes up the sensing layer (or perception layer) in IoT architecture. This authoritative guide offers graduate students, postgraduates, researchers, and practicing engineers with state-of-the-art processes and cutting-edge technologies on MEMS /NEMS, micro- and nanomachining, and microsensors, addressing progress in the field and prospects for future development. Presents latest international research on MEMS/NEMS fabrication technologies and novel micro/nano sensors; Covers a broad spectrum of sensor applications; Written by leading experts in the field.",

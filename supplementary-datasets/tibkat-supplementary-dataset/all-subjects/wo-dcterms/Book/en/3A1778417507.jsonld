For this Special issue, we invited articles on current state-of-the-art technologies and solutions in G2V and V2G, including but not limited to the operation and control of gridable vehicles, energy storage and management systems, charging infrastructure and chargers, EV demand and load forecasting, V2G interfaces and applications, V2G and energy reliability and security, environmental impacts, and economic benefits as well as demonstration projects and case studies in the aforementioned areas. Articles that deal with the latest hot topics in V2G are of particular interest, such as V2G and demand-side response control technique, smart charging infrastructure and grid planning, advanced power electronics for V2G systems, adaptation of V2G systems in the smart grid, adaptation of smart cities for a large number of EVs, integration, and the optimization of V2G systems, utilities and transportation assets for advanced V2G systems, wireless power transfer systems for advanced V2G systems, fault detection, maintenance and diagnostics in V2G processes, communications protocols for V2G systems, energy management system (EMS) in V2G systems, IoT for V2G systems, distributed energy and storage systems for V2G, transportation networks and V2G, energy management for V2G, smart charging/discharging stations for efficient V2G, environmental and socio-economic benefits and challenges of V2G systems, and building integrated V2G systems (BIV2G). Five manuscripts are published in this Special Issue, including \u201cAn Ensemble Stochastic Forecasting Framework for Variable Distributed Demand Loads\u201d by Agyeman et al., \u201cWhere Will You Park? Predicting Vehicle Locations for Vehicle-to-Grid, An MPC Scheme with Enhanced Active Voltage Vector Region for V2G Inverter\u201d by Shipman et al., \u201cElectric Vehicles Energy Management with V2G/G2V Multifactor Optimization of Smart Grids\u201d by Xia et al., and \u201cA Review on Communication Standards and Charging Topologies of V2G and V2H Operation Strategies\u201d by Savitti et al",

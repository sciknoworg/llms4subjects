                "TRIZ is a valuable tool for inventive problem solving. Based on patent analysis TRIZ enables the faster solution-oriented generation of ideas in fields of technology, organizations, and software. TRIZ originated from mainly mechanical problems. But it can be applied very successfully as well for other branches like business, or sustainability or in traffic planning. This enlarged application range offers supplementary value of the tool box TRIZ. The 2nd TRIZ online conference by Bayern Innovativ was born from the TRIZ-Anwendertage. The idea behind is providing a platform that allows to discuss and display TRIZ development in the context of innovation methodology. This book presents papers in English & German language on how TRIZ is related to other tools like Design Thinking, the St. Gallen Business models, etc. and to different areas of application, not only electro-mechanical. The Editor Oliver Mayer is working at Bayern Innovativ in Nuremberg, Germany on projects encouraging and provoking innovations as well as new technologies for companies in Bavaria. As Master Black Belt, TRIZ Master and expert in Design Thinking and agile project management techniques he has in-depth knowledge on the theory. Being a networker for Bavarian companies in his job at Bayern Innovativ, Oliver is pushing to bring together theory and practice. With this expertise the book of proceeding, compiled from the conference papers, offers deep insight into TRIZ and its intersections to other innovation tools."

            "abstract": "The Strategic Alliances Fieldbook: The Art of Agile Alliances is for technology and professional services practitioners and executives seeking faster value from their partnerships as traditional alliances are changing rapidly in form and tempo. Digitising customer channels and internal operations has been a long-running initiative for most companies, and the global Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the urgency and budgets associated with the digital transformations that technology and professional services companies support. The Strategic Alliances Fieldbook compiles a century of the authors' experience of leading joint businesses to solve the problem of how to go fast and avoid common issues that delay alliances. The reader will get a detailed analysis of professional services companies and technology companies and how the dynamics of their collective culture and operating model are shaped when working in partnership. The book provides a 'Blueprint': a library of methods that includes 15 templates which can be applied to accelerate any alliance. The book also includes 19 case studies to illustrate real-life situations. This book is particularly relevant to executives involved in partnership initiatives, specifically in professional services and technology firms, and can be read in conjunction with The Strategic Alliance Handbook by Mike Nevin.",

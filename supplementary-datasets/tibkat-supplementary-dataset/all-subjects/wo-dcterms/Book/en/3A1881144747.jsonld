                "This book comprehensively describes the operating principles and theoretical foundations of solar chimneys. It covers current research results, including numerical analysis and mathematical models based on different assumptions. Complying with the application of renewable energy in sustainable buildings, solar chimney has received extensive attention as an indispensable part natural ventilation. This book is a guide to the application of solar chimneys from single zones to multi zones, and it provides a reference source of application for construction practitioners and engineering decision-makers. The design basis and the related basic principles of fluid mechanics and natural ventilation design strategies introduced in this book will also be beneficial to college students."

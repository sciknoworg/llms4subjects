            "abstract": "Within the second half of the last century, quantum cosmology concretely became one of the main research lines within gravitational theory and cosmology. Substantial progress has been made. Furthermore, quantum cosmology can become a domain that will gradually develop further over the next handful of decades, perhaps assisted by technological developments. Indications for new physics (i.e., beyond the standard model of particle physics or general relativity) could emerge and then the observable universe would surely be seen from quite a new perspective. This motivates bringing quantum cosmology to more research groups and individuals.This Special Issue (SI) aims to provide a wide set of reviews, ranging from foundational issues to (very) recent advancing discussions. Concretely, we want to inspire new work proposing observational tests, providing an aggregated set of contributions, covering several lines, some of which are thoroughly explored, some allowing progress, and others much unexplored. The aim of this SI is motivate new researchers to employ and further develop quantum cosmology over the forthcoming decades. Textbooks and reviews exist on the present subject, and this SI will complementarily assist in offering open access to a set of wide-ranging reviews. Hopefully, this will assist new interested researchers, in having a single open access online volume, with reviews that can help. In particular, this will help in selecting what to explore, what to read in more detail, where to proceed, and what to investigate further within quantum cosmology",

                "\"Focusing on knowledge-intensive and innovative entrepreneurial firms and multinationals, this book explains how Chinese firms are increasingly developing innovative capabilities and engaging in globalization. As Chinese firms become world-leaders in their markets and household names internationally, this timely book examines innovation ecosystems and their affect on Chinese firms to act on innovative opportunities. Cutting-edge chapters advance debates in entrepreneurship, innovation management, economic geography and international business, analysing the co-evolution between the innovation ecosystem and innovation capabilities of Chinese firms. Drawing attention to the interdependencies of globalization, mergers and acquisitions and innovation, leading scholars in Chinese economics and entrepreneurship unpack the role of market capabilities in the development process of innovation and globalization to mark the trajectories of global Chinese firms. Addressing key themes in Chinese entrepreneurship, this book is crucial reading for scholars and researchers of business and economics, particularly those focusing on innovative capabilities. Its practical insights and empirical findings will also be beneficial to practitioners and policymakers\"--",

            "abstract": "\"Optical Engineering Science is a facilitating technology. It underpins the design of commercial optical systems, such as mobile phone cameras and digital cameras as well as highly sophisticated instruments for commercial and research applications. At one end of the scale, this might include the design, manufacture and test of space or aerospace instrumentation. At the other end of the scale, this might embrace optical sensor technology for environmental monitoring. In addition, it is a discipline that is relevant to the laboratory practice in optics in a very wide variety of applications, both commercial and research. This book is a comprehensive text on Optical Engineering. It brings together a basic theoretical treatment of classical optics and combines it with an all embracing practitioner's view of the field of optics. It expands to examine a wide range of practical topics, relating to optical design, optical metrology and manufacturing. Whilst some aspects of the book appear in academic and specialist texts, no comprehensive text covers all these aspects in a single unified treatment, particularly those aimed at an engineering (and not physics) audience. Intended for the professional working in the field of optics as a reference text, the concept has grown out of a series of lectures delivered both at the graduate and professional level\"--",

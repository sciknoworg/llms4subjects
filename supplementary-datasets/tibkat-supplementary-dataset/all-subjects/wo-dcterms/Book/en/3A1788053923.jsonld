            "abstract": "\"The above powerful and unequivocal quotation from the former President of the USA reinforces the importance of ethics in the society and world we live in. It is perhaps the same quotation which has provided the focus for this book in an attempt to encourage construction practitioners to take a more proactive ethical stance in project management, change current working practices in the construction industry and improve project outcomes. Accordingly, the main focus of the book is to explore the role of ethics in construction management. In this regard, the overarching aim of the book is to create a factual client 'how to do it' guide or 'toolkit' for procuring more successful project outcomes. It is intended that this practical guide for construction practitioners can develop into a common due diligence framework on how to initiate, procure and manage construction projects and developments with ethical considerations at their heart. From this perspective, it will raise awareness of best practice and instil improvements in construction management with ethical compliance at the epicentre of project teams. It will seek to address the significant institutional risk that lies in the lack of a clear and consistent approach to ethics in projects and guidelines which are seldom universal and therein open to different interpretations. Such an approach will constitute a viable tool in ensuring effective, appropriate and successful interfaces of ethical standards and principles, via codes of conduct, in pursuit of improvements to construction management practices. Furthermore, it is also intended to provide an important insight into the influence of professional ethics in the success of construction projects and redevelopment programmes.\"--",

            "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most informative and widely used imaging technologies for the clinical examination of soft tissues. It has been used to evaluate the structural integrity of nearly all tissues and is unparalleled in analyses of the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Since its inception, MRI applications have undergone a broad evolution that has led to such well-established procedures as parallel imaging and functional MRI. Recent years have seen a new generation of applications, which has benefitted from a synergy of these established methods and a parallel evolution occurring in computational analyses. These recent MRI trends tend toward a growing emphasis on functional performance, greater reliance on extended computational analysis, and an expansion in the range of multimodal structural assessments. This book showcases these trends through in-depth analyses of select applications from this new generation of MRI methods. New Advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides an insightful and detailed view into these upcoming developments that will be of interest to MRI professionals and scientists alike",

                "In the literature on forced migration, little is known about the experiences of Iraqi refugees resettled in the United States through the US Refugee Admissions, Reception and Placement Program. As part of its longstanding refugee resettlement policy, the United States has accepted and provided safe haven to thousands of refugees. Focusing primarily on the situation of Iraqis resettled in Arizona since the 1990s, this research uses interview findings and first-hand data to examine various aspects of their post-resettlement experiences through a meta-theoretical approach that includes aspects of humanitarian governance, adaptation, acculturation and integration. Building on this theoretical understanding, this book examines the process from the first moment of resettlement to integration as a multi-layered social reality and reveals the fundamental impact of forced migration on the 'politics of refugee life'. By examining the US resettlement program in relation to the role and functions of resettlement agencies and non-profit organizations in collaboration with the government, this book highlights the fundamental difference between refugee integration and migrant integration, introduces new concepts of integration, discusses the US refugee admissions, reception and placement program and refugee integration in relation to the organization of humanitarian governance globally, and offers recommendations for improving resettlement and integration processes. Volkan Deli has a Ph.D. in Sociology from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye. He is a part-time lecturer at TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye and an external affiliate for the Centre for Refugee Studies (CRS) at York University, Toronto, Canada. During his 14-year professional career, he undertook various positions in a non-governmental organization working with refugees, UNHCR and the Council of Europe offices in T\u00fcrkiye respectively in the fields of refugee rights, refugee protection, international protection, access to justice for women and girls.",

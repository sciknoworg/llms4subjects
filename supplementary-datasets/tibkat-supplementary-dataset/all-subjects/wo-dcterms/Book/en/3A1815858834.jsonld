            "abstract": [
                "This volume analyses New Delhi\u2019s reaction to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the rise of politics of connectivity and infrastructure building which has heightened Sino-Indian rivalry in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). It can be evidenced that the BRI has transformed the Sino-Indian dynamics from a \u2018managed rivalry\u2019 to an intense geo-political competition. It is contended that competition is inevitable when two powers rise in the same neighbourhood. The Indian government has opposed the BRI since its inception noting that the \u2018BRI violates India\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u2019 because one of the flagship BRI projects - the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - runs through (Pakistan-controlled) Kashmir which India claims to be its own territory. It has consistently maintained that China\u2019s \u2018connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognized international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality, and must be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity\u2019 of other states. Beyond those stated reservations, New Delhi is concerned about the BRI infrastructure and connectivity projects in the smaller South Asian countries and the Indian Ocean littoral states. India has traditionally viewed South Asia and the IOR as its backyard over which it has historically maintained a position of influence. It is apprehensive that the BRI projects will enhance Beijing\u2019s stature and undermine India\u2019s influence in the region. In eleven chapters including Introduction and Conclusion, this book explores the dimensions of the rivalry and analyses the causes, dynamics and implications of an accelerated Sino-Indian competition. Dr Chakma is Senior Lecturer in the School of Politics and International Studies and Director of the South Asia Project, at the University of Hull. Dr Dai is Former Senior Lecturer in the School of Politics and International Studies at the University of Hull.",

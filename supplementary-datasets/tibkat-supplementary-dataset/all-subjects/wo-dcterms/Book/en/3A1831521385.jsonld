            "abstract": "\"This book provides the reader with the knowledge and investigative methodology on how to investigate cybercrime from a field practitioner's perspective. Cybercrime is aggressively targeting governments, businesses and individuals of all levels in increasing numbers, law enforcement can provide only limited support and civilian investigators have to take responsibility for investigating their own crimes. While there are very high-quality manuals for conducting digital examinations on a device or network that has been hacked, there is no known guide for those who want to use this information to commence an investigation from the location the offence occurred with the intention of location and prosecuting the attacker. That is, from the cybercrime scene. This book provides a valuable contribution to the actual practical ground level investigation including evidence location, lawful seizure, preservation, examination, interpretation and management. These are core duties which if not completed correctly, leads to poor quality and incomplete investigations. It is believed this handbook will sit alongside the other texts stated and fill the gap in the marketplace where the front-line investigator has limited guidance on how to react at the cybercrime scene whilst the offence is occurring. In addition, this book will also help those companies that are GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union regulation that instituted new new rules governing the use and manipulation of personal data) follow a plan if their data is compromised\"--",

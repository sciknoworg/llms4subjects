            "title": "Protection of Future Electricity Systems",
            "abstract": "The electrical energy industry is undergoing dramatic changes: massive deployment of renewables, increasing share of DC networks at transmission and distribution levels, and at the same time, a continuing reduction in conventional synchronous generation, all contribute to a situation where a variety of technical and economic challenges emerge. As the society's reliance on electrical power continues to increase as a result of international decarbonisation commitments, the need for secure and uninterrupted delivery of electrical energy to all customers has never been greater. Power system protection plays an important enabling role in future decarbonized energy systems. This book includes ten papers covering a wide range of topics related to protection system problems and solutions, such as adaptive protection, protection of HVDC and LVDC systems, unconventional or enhanced protection methods, protection of superconducting transmission cables, and high voltage lightning protection. This volume has been edited by Adam Dy\u015bko, Senior Lecturer at the University of Strathclyde, UK, and Dimitrios Tzelepis, Research Fellow at the University of Strathclyde",

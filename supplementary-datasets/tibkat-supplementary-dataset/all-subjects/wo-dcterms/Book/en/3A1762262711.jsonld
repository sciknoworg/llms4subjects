            "abstract": "\"Earth resources are the precious assets that provide living space for human beings. In the last few decades, the pressure on earth resources has increased due to anthropogenic activities and rapid industrialization. The sustainable management of earth resources requires reliable, accurate, and timely information at different observational scales. Geo-information technology is an efficient tool for acquiring information required for environmental protection, earth resources monitoring, and addressing the issues associated with sustainable development and management. It offers an influential and capable tool for mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of earth resources. Many researchers have reported their findings and operational applications of direct relevance to the management of earth resources with the launch of imaging satellites in the 1970s. However, few studies have been reported to understand the core science and research basics, as there are larger issues of capacity building to use geo-information technology in sustainable development and management of earth resources. There is also a fundamental gap between the theoretical concepts and the operational use of these advanced tools. This could be resolved by providing a broad range of applications of this technology to the scientific and research community in the field of geospatial technologies and allied subjects. This book, entitled \"Geo-Information Technology in Earth Resources Monitoring and Management,\" deals with the challenges for sustainable management and development of earth resources with a focus on India and other countries around the world. The chapters are written by prominent academicians, researchers, and experts in the field of geo-information technology and related subjects. This book is a collection of chapters providing a multi-disciplinary overview for academicians, researchers, scientists, administrators, policymakers, social scientists, and professionals involved in the various aspects of earth resources development, planning, and management. The aim of this book is to replenish the gap in the available literature on the subject by bringing together the concepts, theories, and experiences of specialists and professionals in this field\"--",

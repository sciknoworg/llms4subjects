            "abstract": "Television series are undoubtedly an audio-visual production space that people in every country are eagerly following. Television series are known to have an impact in the public sphere. These effects are discussed in various topics. Another feature of television series, which can be examined in many dimensions in public life, is that productions are demanded not only nationally but also in the international arena.  Television series produced in Turkey are in demand worldwide and this issue is worth examining from a scientific point of view. Examining this issue as an export element is another research title. In this context, this book offers an idea of the domain, reception status and acceptance of international turkish television series in various countries. As a foresight; television will have quite a series as well; perhaps it will change in terms of production techniques, but it will continue to be popular as a production type.  This book aims to contribute the field that needs to be discussed at all points in media scope and we hope to light the fuse for the international academic community",

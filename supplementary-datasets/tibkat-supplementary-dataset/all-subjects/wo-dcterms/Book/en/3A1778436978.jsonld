            "title": "Integration of High Voltage AC/DC Grids into Modern Power Systems",
            "abstract": "Electric power transmission relies on AC and DC grids. The extensive integration of conventional and nonconventional energy sources and power converters into power grids has resulted in a demand for high voltage (HV), extra-high voltage (EHV), and ultra-high voltage (UHV) AC/DC transmission grids in modern power systems. To ensure the security, adequacy, and reliable operation of power systems, the practical aspects of interconnecting HV, EHV, and UHV AC/DC grids into the electric power systems, along with their economic and environmental impacts, should be considered. The stability analysis for the planning and operation of HV, EHV, and UHV AC/DC grids in power systems is regarded as another key issue in modern power systems. Moreover, interactions between power converters and other power electronics devices (e.g., FACTS devices) installed on the network are other aspects of power systems that must be addressed. This Special Issue aims to investigate the integration of HV, EHV, and UHV AC/DC grids into modern power systems by analyzing their control, operation, protection, dynamics, planning, reliability, and security, along with considering power quality improvement, market operations, power conversion, cybersecurity, supervisory and monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics systems",

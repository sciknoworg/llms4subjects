            "abstract": "There are multiple obstacles to use of health information systems (HISs) in Yemen, including fragmented systems, insufficient infrastructure, a lack of skilled personnel, and the absence of standardized registries with identical terminology and coding. The absence of unified strategic visions1, standards, vocabulary, and terminologies further complicate the situation. Despite these challenges, Yemen has made strides in implementing various HIS with support from international partners, including the most widely used--the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2), for routine health data collection and analysis. However, it should be noted that the DHIS2 is not intended to serve as an electronic medical record (EMR) system in Yemen. This note underscores the potential of digital health solutions in transforming Yemen's HIS. Introduction of a Digital Health Platform (DHP), designed to enhance the interoperability and integration of current and future HIS, is an opportunity for Yemen. The DHP helps improve data governance, management, and usage by encouraging the efficient use of digital health standards and open-source tools. A gradual, flexible, and demand-driven approach is encouraged, emphasizing the integration of existing HIS. Recognizing challenges and opportunities around HIS in Yemen, the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP) intends to effectively utilize digital solutions to foster greater improvements in HIS governance, architecture. The MoPHP intends to establisha foundational blueprint that can be synergized with the DHP and other proposed digitalhealth solutions, thereby accelerating the pace of implementation and ensuring a cohesiveapproach to health care transformation",

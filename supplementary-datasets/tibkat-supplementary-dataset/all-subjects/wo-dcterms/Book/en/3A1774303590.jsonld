            "title": "Palestinian Kindergarten Curriculum Framework : A Review of the Mathematics Development Progression",
            "abstract": "Early mathematics learning has garnered considerable attention globally over the past few years. This increased attention is motivated by global research pointing to the importance of early mathematics in supporting children`s later academic development. The need to ensure that children have explicit and planned opportunities to develop foundational mathematics skills has led to the development of research-based early mathematics curricula that clearly articulate the types of mathematics learning experiences young children can and should have at different points in their learning pathways. The present study was commissioned by the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education to review the Palestinian kindergarten (KG) curriculum framework with a focus on the early mathematics progression that it puts forward. Specifically, the study aims to provide answers to three questions: (1) to what extent is the curriculum structured along a developmental progression that reflects the latest cognitive research on how children learn mathematics from an early age?; (2) how does the Palestinian early mathematics curriculum compare to that of other countries with established KG systems, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and Singapore?; and (3) how well does the curriculum align with the Grade 1 Palestinian mathematics curriculum? It then puts forward a number of recommendations to improve early mathematics learning in KG classrooms",

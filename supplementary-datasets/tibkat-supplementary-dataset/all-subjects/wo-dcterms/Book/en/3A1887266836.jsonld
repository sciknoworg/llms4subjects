                "With its combination of readability, love for details and rigor, \u201cFatigue and Corrosion in Metals\u201d has become an authoritative reference work that has quickly established itself as the most comprehensive guide for fatigue and corrosion design available to date. It has been adopted by several universities as reference textbook and consulted by professional engineers and scholars worldwide. This must-have Second Edition, completely revisited to account for advances in the decade since the previous edition was published, includes: \u2022 a new chapter on damage nucleation; \u2022 a new Chapter on Very High Cycle Fatigue; \u2022 a new Chapter on fatigue testing and fatigue S-N curve determination; \u2022 expanded analysis of surface treatments and inclusions effect on fatigue; \u2022 expanded treatment of volume process effect on fatigue; \u2022 expanded treatments of corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. In addition to these enhancements, it includes a detailed treatment of: \u2022 phenomenology and morphological aspects of fatigue; \u2022 surface treatments, conditions, and nonmetallic inclusions effects on fatigue; \u2022 stress and strain-based fatigue analysis; \u2022 mean stress and notch effect on fatigue; \u2022 cumulative damage and multiaxial fatigue; \u2022 probabilistic analysis application to fatigue design; \u2022 fatigue in welds; \u2022 stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement; \u2022 fracture mechanics application to fatigue and corrosion. It serves as a valuable and needful information source on the desktop of anyone involved with fatigue and corrosion in metals."

            "abstract": "Railways play an important role in the transportation systems of many developing countries. Railways stations are a key but often neglected part of this railway service. Many countries are considering railway station redevelopment to improve their rail service. They include many developing countries In this report, the term redevelopment refers to changes to existing stations (as opposed to new development). It encompasses refurbishment, renovation, or improvement to station buildings, platforms, and operational rail infrastructure and to the land in its surrounding areas. Much of this report will focus on the redevelopment of the railway station building itself, as this is often the first level of station redevelopment considered. While station redevelopment projects provide many benefits, they are complex to deliver and require a unique set of knowledge, skills, and know-how. This is particularly true when the railway intends to deliver a project through a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme. PPPs require appropriate institutional arrangement with financial and legal expertise to structure, procure, and implement PPP transactions successfully. The objective of this report is to provide railway authorities and policy makers with guidance and knowledge to help in design and implementation of railway station redevelopment projects, leading to more viable and successful projects",

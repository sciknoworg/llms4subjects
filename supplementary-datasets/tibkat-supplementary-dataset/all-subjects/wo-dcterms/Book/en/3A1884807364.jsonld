                "This book provides a comprehensive account of the tumultuous political landscape of Zimbabwe. Delving into historical and contemporary perspectives, the author analyses the relationship between the ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition, exposing the pervasive influence of foreign powers and their \u2018regime change\u2019 agendas. Amidst western-imposed economic sanctions, the book examines how political opposition has struggled to maintain its footing in the face of ZANU-PF's rhetoric on preserving the nation's sovereignty. Drawing on the powerful theoretical frameworks of Gramsci's hegemony theory and instrumentalism, the book dissects the constraints on multiparty democracy under ZANU-PF's rule. From the party's manipulation of liberation narratives to the subtle intricacies of \u2018Mugabeism\u2019, a violent and ideological stronghold, the author unveils the tactics employed to maintain power. The chapters uncover the pivotal role played by the military throughout Zimbabwe's history: from the days of the liberation struggle to the shocking events of 2017, when Mugabe's grip on power was diminished by the very force that had propped him up for decades, the author reveals how the military's involvement has thwarted opposition players' attempts to claim power. Boldly challenging the notion that constraints solely rest on ZANU-PF, this book calls attention to the shortcomings of opposition parties in navigating Zimbabwe\u2019s treacherous political landscape. Using compelling evidence and unparalleled analysis, the book is an essential read for those seeking to understand the intricate web of power, manipulation, and struggle that has defined Zimbabwe's political journey. Aaron Rwodzi is Secretary of the Development Studies Association of Zimbabwe (DeSAZ). He holds a PhD from the University of ZwaZulu Natal, South Africa, and his research interests span political and social histories, and democracy, race, and cultural studies."

            "abstract": "Beta Exercise: The Theory and Practice of Osamu Kanemura is the first bilingual (Japanese-English) book to provide an overview of the theoretical work of Japanese photographer and video artist Osamu Kanemura, a unique voice in the world of contemporary photography.  The opening essay \u201cLife Is a Gift\u201d comments on the transformation of human life into an exchangeable commodity and the abstraction it entails. \u201cEssay 01\u201d develops Kanemura\u2019s idea of photographic \u201ctechnique\u201d in an era when such techniques have become accessible to all, radically undermining the importance of human subjectivity in the process of capturing the photographic image: \u201cWe can say that modern technology constitutes photographic technique.\u201d Instead, Kanemura argues, extra-technical elements such as concept and vision will have to compensate for the expression of individuality that technique is no longer able to convey.  Taking cues from Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Karlheinz Stockhausen, the essay \u201cDead-Stick Landing\u201d develops Kanemura\u2019s theory of the moving image as mechanical system, solely governed by an \u201con-off switch.\u201d \u201cEssay 02\u201d develops these ideas into a consideration of cinematic time and the experience of boredom in cinema as the result of a truthful \u201cloyalty\u201d expressed to machines, and not to stories.  The essays are accompanied by an extensive two-part interview with Italian photographer Marco Mazzi, touching upon topics ranging from the technical aspects of his equipment, the concept of non-editing, and the destruction of the frame to the similarity between Mao\u2019s dialectics and the camera, the presence of the human figure as trace, and the politics of photographing Tokyo",

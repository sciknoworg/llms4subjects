            "abstract": "Catherine O\u2019Brien draws on the structure of Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy to explore Scorsese\u2019s feature films from Who\u2019s that knocking at my door (1967-69) to Silence (2016). In Dante\u2019s poem in 100 cantos, the Pilgrim is guided by the poet Virgil down through the circles of Hell in Inferno; he then climbs the steep Mountain of the Seven Deadly Sins in Purgatory; and he finally encounters God in Paradise. Embracing this popular analogy, this study envisions Martin Scorsese as a contemporary Dante, with his filmic oeuvre offering the dimensions of a cinematic Divine Comedy. Martin Scorsese\u2019s Divine Comedy is the first full-length study to focus on the trajectory of faith and doubt from 1967-2016, taking very seriously the oft-quoted words of the director himself: \u2018My whole life has been movies and religion. That\u2019s it. Nothing else.\u2019 Films discussed include GoodFellas, Casino, Taxi Driver and Mean Streets, as well as the more recent Wolf of Wall Street and Silence",

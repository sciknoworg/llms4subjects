            "abstract": "Field-programmable logic has been available for a number of years. The role of Field-Programmable Logic Devices (FPLDs) has evolved from simply implementing the system `glue-logic' to the ability to implement very complex system functions, such as microprocessors and microcomputers. The speed with which these devices can be programmed makes them ideal for prototyping. Low production cost makes them competitive for small to medium volume productions. These devices make possible new sophisticated applications, and bring up new hardware/software trade-offs and diminish the traditional hardware/software demarcation line. Advanced design tools are being developed for automatic compilation of complex designs and routings to custom circuits. Digital Systems Design and Prototyping Using Field Programmable Logic covers the subjects of digital systems design and (FPLDs), combining them into an entity useful for designers in the areas of digital systems and rapid system prototyping. It is also useful for the growing community of engineers and researchers dealing with the exciting field of FPLDs, reconfigurable and programmable logic. The authors' goal is to bring these topics to students studying digital system design, computer design, and related subjects in order to show them how very complex circuits can be implemented at the desk. Digital Systems Design and Prototyping Using Field Programmable Logic makes a pioneering effort to present rapid prototyping and generation of computer systems using FPLDs. From the Foreword: `This is a ground-breaking book that bridges the gap between digital design theory and practice. It provides a unifying terminology for describing FPLD technology. In addition to introducing the technology it also describes the design methodology and tools required to harness this technology. It introduces two hardware description languages (e.g. AHDL and VHDL). Design is best learned by practice and the book supports this notion with abundant case studies.' Daniel P. Siewiorek, Carnegie Mellon University CD-ROM INCLUDED&excl; Digital Systems Design and Prototyping Using Field Programmable Logic, First Edition includes a CD-ROM that contains Altera's MAX+PLUS II 7.21 Student Edition Programmable Logic Development Software. MAX+PLUS II is a fully integrated design environment that offers unmatched flexibility and performance. The intuitive graphical interface is complemented by complete and instantly accessible on-line documentation, which makes lea ...",

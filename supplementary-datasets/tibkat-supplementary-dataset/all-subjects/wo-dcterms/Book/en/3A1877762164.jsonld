            "abstract": "Photomedicine is one of the most inspiring and interdisciplinary fields in medicine that involves the research and application of photobiology with respect to health and disease. Photomedicine has contributed to the clinical practice of a variety of medical fields, including dermatology, surgery, radiology, diagnostics, cardiology, and anticancer therapy. Furthermore, expansion of its scope and contribution can be expected. This book covers a wide range of aspects and issues related to photomedicine, which brings together researchers from many countries. These include the basic science of photodynamic therapy, clinical applications in various kinds of medical fields, photochemotherapy, laser therapy for musculoskeletal pain, intense pulsed light therapy for photorejuvenation, biological function of low-level laser therapy, and photobiology for skin rejuvenation. Not only will this be beneficial for readers, but it will also contribute to scientists making further breakthroughs in photomedicine",

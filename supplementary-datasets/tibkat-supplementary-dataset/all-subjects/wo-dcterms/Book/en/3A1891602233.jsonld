            "abstract": "This open access book unveils Hong Kong's pivotal role in the realm of international economic law.   Unique to this book is its focus on the interplay between Hong Kong's historical roots and institutional contexts, integrated into its exploration of unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral economic approaches. What sets this book apart is its in-depth treatment of Hong Kong's distinct position as China's Special Administrative Region. It showcases the balance the territory maintains: the autonomy it enjoys, its own robust legal and economic systems, all while being intertwined with broader global interests. Hong Kong's position as China's economic gateway, coupled with its adaptability amidst technological evolutions and international tensions, positions it uniquely in the global economic arena. With the Asia-Pacific economy's rapid evolution and the Greater Bay Area's development, Hong Kong's role is illuminated as increasingly pivotal.   This book exposes challenges confronting Hong Kong, from political changes to the ramifications of the National Security Law, while emphasising its continued relevance and growing influence. As Hong Kong threads its path in a globalised world, its prowess in international economic law remains a cornerstone of its identity. Will the territory sustain its prominence amidst evolving challenges and global shifts? The answers lie within, and further research awaits as we track its unfolding narrative.   Specifically tailored for academics, diplomats, and researchers in international law, relations, economics and finance, this book offers a vital perspective. Anyone with a vested interest in international economic law and policy will find this comprehensive exploration invaluable.

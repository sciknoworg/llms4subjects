            "abstract": "Moves away from offering a single methodology or approach to social justice teaching, providing practical models for academics to followDescribes policy strategies and pedagogical practices for more equitable instruction of Shakespeare and Renaissance literatureReflects candidly on the relationship between identity and institutionality for Shakespeare educators and their studentsSituates the harms perpetuated by Shakespeare in higher education and revolutionary responses at institutions across the United StatesForegrounds faculty identities and institutional contexts for teaching and learning about ShakespeareDemonstrates for higher education administrators the scholarly legitimacy and social significance of justice-oriented pedagogyOn college and university campuses across the United States, scholar-teachers and their students find themselves in conditions of both real threat and tremendous possibility. Building on the recent surge of interest in equitable pedagogy within the field of Shakespeare and Renaissance literary studies, Situating Shakespeare Pedagogy in U.S. Higher Education makes a case for anchoring our teaching in these institutional power dynamics that have historically contributed to systemic injustice and continue to affect our work on a daily basis. Each of the contributors to this collection speaks directly to the intersection between their own identities, the lived experiences of their students, and the particular qualities of the institutions where they teach-including student demographics, curricular requirements, geographical location, and comparative levels of administrative support for implementing social justice approaches. From this perspective, they provide hope and practical guidance for scholar-educators who want to meet our students where they are",

            "abstract": "Film has long been defined as a temporal art, most famously by Andr\u00e9 Bazin and Andrei Tarkovsky. Yet more fundamentally it has always been a spatial art, transporting its audiences imaginatively to spaces and places other than those they literally inhabit. In the digital era, this spatial illusion and paradox has been greatly expanded \u2013 by the predominance of domestic film viewing, along with new extra-terrestrial perspectives, and the promise of novel kinesthetic experiences with Virtual Reality and \u201cimmersion\u201d. The international authors in this collection address the history and aesthetics of screen media as spatial transposition, in a range of exemplary analyses that run from the landscapes of John Ford\u2019s westerns to Chantal Akerman\u2019s claustrophobic domestic spaces, from the conventions of the English country house film to Patrick Keiller\u2019s Robinson roaming a changed country, and from the experiences of Covid pandemic confinement to those of un-homed van-dwellers in Chloe Zhao\u2019s award-winning NOMADLAND",

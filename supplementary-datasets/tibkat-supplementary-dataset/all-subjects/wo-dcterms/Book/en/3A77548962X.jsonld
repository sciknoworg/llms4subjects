                "These Proceedings contain the papers and oral discussions presented at the Symposium on AERODYNAMIC DRAG MECHANISMS of Bluff Bodies and Road Vehides held at the General Motors Research Laboratories in Warren, Michigan, on September 27 and 28, 1976. This international, invitational Symposium was the twentieth in an annual series, each one having been in a different technical discipline. The Symposia provide a forum for areas of science and technology that are of timely interest to the Research Laboratories as weIl as the technical community at large, and in which personnel of the Laboratories are actively involved. The Symposia furnish an opportunity for the exchange of ideas and current knowledge between participating research specialists from educational, industrial arid governmental institutions and serve to stimulate future research activity. The present world-wide energy situation makes it highly desirable to reduce the force required to move road vehicles through the atmosphere. A significant amount of the total energy consumed for transportation is expended in overcoming the aerodynamic resistance to motion of these vehicles. Reductions in this aerodynamic drag can therefore have a large impact on ground transportation energy requirements. Although aerodynamic development work on road vehides has been performed for many years, it has not been widely reported or accompanied by much basic research."

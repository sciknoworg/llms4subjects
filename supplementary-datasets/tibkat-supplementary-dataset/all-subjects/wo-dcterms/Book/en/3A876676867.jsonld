                "The tools and techniques you need to break the analog design bottleneck! Ten years ago, analog seemed to be a dead-end technology. Today, System-on-Chip (SoC) designs are increasingly mixed-signal designs. With the advent of application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) technologies that can integrate both analog and digital functions on a single chip, analog has become more crucial than ever to the design process. Today, designers are moving beyond hand-crafted, one-transistor-at-a-time methods. They are using new circuit and physical synthesis tools to design practical analog circuits; new modeling and analysis tools to allow rapid exploration of system level alternatives; and new simulation tools to provide accurate answers for analog circuit behaviors and interactions that were considered impossible to handle only a few years ago. To give circuit designers and CAD professionals a better understanding of the history and the current state of the art in the field, this volume collects in one place the essential set of analog CAD papers that form the foundation of today's new analog design automation tools. Areas covered are: . Analog synthesis. Symbolic analysis. Analog layout. Analog modeling and analysis. Specialized analog simulation. Circuit centering and yield optimization. Circuit testing Computer-Aided Design of Analog Integrated Circuits and Systems is the cutting-edge reference that will be an invaluable resource for every semiconductor circuit designer and CAD professional who hopes to break the analog design bottleneck",

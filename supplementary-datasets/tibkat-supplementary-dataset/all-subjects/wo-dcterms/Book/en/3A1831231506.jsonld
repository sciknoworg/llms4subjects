                "This contributed volume collects papers related to the Logic in Question workshop, which has taken place annually at Sorbonne University in Paris since 2011. Each year, the workshop brings together historians, philosophers, mathematicians, linguists, and computer scientists to explore questions related to the nature of logic and how it has developed over the years. As a result, chapter authors provide a thorough, interdisciplinary exploration of topics that have been studied in the workshop. Organized into three sections, the first part of the book focuses on historical questions related to logic, the second explores philosophical questions, and the third section is dedicated to mathematical discussions. Specific topics include: \u2022 logic and analogy \u2022 Chinese logic \u2022 nineteenth century British logic (in particular Boole and Lewis Carroll) \u2022 logical diagrams \u2022 the place and value of logic in Louis Couturat\u2019s philosophical thinking \u2022 contributions of logical analysis for mathematics education \u2022 the exceptionality of logic \u2022 the logical expressive power of natural languages \u2022 the unification of mathematics via topos theory Logic in Question will appeal to pure logicians, historians of logic, philosophers, linguists, and other researchers interested in the history of logic, making this volume a unique and valuable contribution to the field.",

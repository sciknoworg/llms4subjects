                "This book was written with the objective of providing geotechnical engineers with a practical guideline on how to cope with landslides as well as of acquaint\u00ad ing them with the present state of physical fundamentals and scientific expla\u00ad nations for the phenomenon of landslides. The book is based on my personal experiences, gathered over decades of work as geotechnical engineer on construction sites in Austria and many other parts of the world, which I also use in my lectures at the Technical University of Graz, Austria. The method of stabilizing lands lides by short-circuit conductors has been developed by myself and has been patented in Germany and Italy. A number of publications already exists (see References) on this method, and of course I also deal in this book with its theoretical and practical aspects. Here I want to thank my assistants, Messrs. J. Dalmatiner, K. Eigenberger, E. Garber, H. Kienberger, R. P\u00f6tscher, and W. Prodinger, for working with me on various projects and for assisting me in the drafting of some chapters of this book, Mr. A. Trippl for preparing the illustrations, and my wife for many a Sunday worked through with me."

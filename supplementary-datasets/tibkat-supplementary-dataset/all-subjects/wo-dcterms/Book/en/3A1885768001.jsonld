            "title": "Chapter A Decolonial Intent. Lalage Bown and the Emergence of an African Voice",
            "abstract": "Our chapter provides evidence of Lalage\u2019s decolonial intent through two narratives linked to two conferences. First is the story of her work as Secretary for the two sessions of the International Congress of Africanists actually held in Africa. The second is a close-up look of Lalage\u2019s vision of what a truly transformative African approach to education for liberation looked like. Michael Omolewa, with his historical touch, has drawn on documents from Lalage\u2019s papers in the Oxford University archives and elsewhere. The second story comes from Budd Hall\u2019s personal experience working with Lalage on the organising of the 1971 meeting of the African Association of Adult Education in Dar es Salaam. Taken together these stories provide insights into Lalage\u2019s commitment to providing space for African intellectuals and political leaders to rise from the colonial constraints of the day as well as to her ideas about the practical work needed to break colonial chains politically and institutionally. We close with a poem, a tribute to Lalage written by Budd on the occasion of her 90th birthday",

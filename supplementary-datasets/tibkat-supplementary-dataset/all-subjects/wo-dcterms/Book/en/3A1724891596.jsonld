            "title": "Malawi Drought 2015-2016 : Post-Disaster Needs Assessment",
            "abstract": "The highly variable climate of Malawi significantly influences the amount, timing, and frequency of precipitation resulting in frequent droughts and floods. In the 2015-2016 rainfall season Malawi was hit again by prolonged dry spells. In response to the dry spells, the Government of Malawi declared a state of disaster in April 2016, and a post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) was initiated in mid-May under the leadership of the Government of Malawi, with the assistance of the World Bank and the United Nations (UN). The PDNA also developed a recovery strategy for the 2015-2016 drought by defining and aligning a national recovery vision to long-term development objectives and by formulating a multi-sector framework of recovery interventions, while ensuring building-back-better and integrating gender and environmental considerations in the recovery strategy. The assessment process utilized a combination of secondary data from similar assessments that were ongoing at that time, along with primary data collection to fill in gaps and validate impacts. The PDNA defines a strategy for recovery, including its financial implications, while making recommendations to improve future drought resilience. The report is structured as follows: chapter one explains the background and objective of the PDNA; chapter two describes the country profile; chapter three provides an analysis of the drought and an overview of the humanitarian consequences and the government's immediate response; chapter 4 describes the approach and methodology of the PDNA; chapter five summarizes the overall damages and losses caused by the drought, as well as the recovery strategies and needs for each of the sectors considered in the assessment; chapter six describes the overall macroeconomic impact of the drought; chapter seven presents the human and social impact of the drought, including a gender analysis of specific sector recommendations for recovery; chapter eight provides details for the drought recovery strategy on the basis of the sector analysis; chapter nine analyses the challenges and lessons learned from the ongoing drought and recommendations for drought risk reduction and resilience; chapter ten summarizes the next steps and the way forward",

                "This open access book addresses the question of how God can providentially govern apparently ungovernable randomness. Medieval theologians confidently held that God is provident, that is, God is the ultimate cause of or is responsible for everything that happens. However, scientific advances since the 19th century pose serious challenges to traditional views of providence. From Darwinian evolution to quantum mechanics, randomness has become an essential part of the scientific worldview. An interdisciplinary team of Muslim, Christian and Jewish scholars\u2014biologists, physicists, philosophers and theologians\u2014addresses questions of randomness and providence. Kelly James Clark is author, co-author, or editor of more than 30 books including Religion and the Sciences of Origins, Strangers, Neighbors Friends: Muslim-Christian-Jewish Reflections on Compassion and Peace, and Abraham\u2019s Children: Liberty and Tolerance in an Age of Religious Conflict. Jeffrey Koperski is Professor of Philosophy at Saginaw Valley State University. He is the author of The Physics of Theism: God, Physics, and the Philosophy of Science, and Divine Action, Determinism, and the Laws of Nature."

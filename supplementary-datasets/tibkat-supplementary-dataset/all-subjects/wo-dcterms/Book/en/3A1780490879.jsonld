            "abstract": "Thailand is the twentieth most populous country in the world, located at the center of Southeast Asia. The southern end of the country is a peninsula with the Andaman Sea to the west and Gulf of Thailand. Located in the tropical region, Thailand's climate is relatively warm all year round. Thailand has experienced negative growth due to the impacts form the Coronavirus (COIVD-19) pandemic, which has adversely affected Thailand's small, open economy, its export and the country's tourism sector. To counter this, Thailand has placed emphasis on self-reliance and resilience to external factors in its economic planning. This document aims to succinctly summarize the climate risks faced by Thailand. This includes rapid onset and long-term changes in key climate parameters, as well as impacts of these changes on communities, livelihoods and economies, many of which are already underway. Climate change is a major risk to good development outcomes, and the World Bank Group is committed to playing an important role in helping countries integrate climate action into their core development agendas. The World Bank Group (WBG) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are committed to supporting client countries to invest in and build a low-carbon, climate resilient future, helping them to be better prepared to adapt to current and future climate impacts",

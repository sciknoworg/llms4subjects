                "This volume of Thermal Stresses in ~~terials and Structures in Severe Thermal Environments constitutes the proceedings of an international conference held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA, on ~1arch 19, 20 and 21, 1980. The purpose of the conference was to bring together experts in the areas of heat transfer, theoretical and applied mechanics amd materials science and engineering, with a.common interest in the highly interdisciplinary nature of the thermal stress problem. It is the hope of the program chairmen that the resulting interac\u00ad tion has led to a greater understanding of the underlying prin\u00ad ciples of the thermal stress problem and to an improved design and selection of materials for structures subjected to high thermal stresses. The program chairmen gratefully acknowledge the financial assistance for the conference provided by the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, the Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research as well as the Departments of Engineering Science and Mechanics and Materials Engineering at Virginia Poly\u00ad technic Institute and State University. A number of professional societies also provided mailing lists for the program at no nominal cost The Associate Director, Mr. R. J. Harshberger and his staff at the Conference Center for Continuing Education at VPI and SU should be recognized especially for their coordination of the con\u00ad ference activities, lunches and banquet. Provost John D. Wilson gave a most enlightening and provocative after-dinner speech."

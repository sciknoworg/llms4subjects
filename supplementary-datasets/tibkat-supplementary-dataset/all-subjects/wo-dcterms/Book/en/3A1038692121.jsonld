As the first scientific international conference on safety & security issues in the CBRNE field, SICC 2017 attracted contributions resulting from fruitful inter-professional collaborations between university and military experts, specialized operators, decision makers and the industry. As such, these proceedings are primarily intended for academics and professionals from public, private and military entities. It is the first trans-disciplinary collection of scientific papers from the numerous fields related to CBRNE"

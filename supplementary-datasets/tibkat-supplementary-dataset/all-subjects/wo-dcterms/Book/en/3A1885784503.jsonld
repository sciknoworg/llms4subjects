            "abstract": "How important is it for language learners to have a \u2018good accent\u2019 in the foreign language? Do they want to sound like native speakers, or is intelligibility their main aim? How do they perceive their L2 accents, and what kind of sensations do these procure? These are some of the questions addressed in this volume which reports on a large-scale and wide-ranging survey of the attitudes of Italian university students of foreign languages. It investigates their motivations, self-perceptions, and opinions towards L2 pronunciation, taking into account the influence of gender, plurilingualism, target language and proficiency level, and is likely to be of interest to anyone involved in language teaching at university level",

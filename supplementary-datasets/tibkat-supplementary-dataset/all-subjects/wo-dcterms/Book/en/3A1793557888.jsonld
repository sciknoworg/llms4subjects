                "\"Analysing past and ongoing trends that have shaped the landscape of universities worldwide, this book explores the possible paths for the future of universities, along three main dimensions characterising key strategic choices: knowledge creation and dissemination; relationships within society and governance mechanisms. By sharing reflections and offering directions on the changing role of technical universities, especially in Europe, this book considers the change and disruption that are causing universities to reconsider their role. This book: -provides an up-to-date picture of the role of technical universities in the European context -critically discusses the strengths and weaknesses of technical universities -identifies emerging challenges that will shape their evolution going forward -provides insight into how current models can be adapted and adopted for future use. Impinging on extensive trans-disciplinary research, this book highlights the need of the technical university within society and its role not only to improve skills, but education in the most articulated sense, to train future citizens and professionals. The book is a must-read for all those interested in the future of the technical university\"--",

            "abstract": "Safety management in construction sites has always been one of the most sensitive aspects of the AECO industry and a problematic that recalls the complexity of such a multifactor domain. The high number of work accidents that occur on construction sites is also caused by the fact that not all the information to work safely is always available. For instance, visibility during some maneuvers is a key aspect of safety in operations, and this is often impeded due to the layout of the construction site and working methods, especially in the use of some equipment. The latest approaches in order to overcome complex situations is represented by the Digital Twin paradigm. This approach has among its main criticisms:1) the way of connecting physical reality and its digital replica and 2) the system for exploiting the combination of real-time data and digital applied intelligence for supporting operations on site. This paper proposes a framework for the development of digital twin of the construction site. An application of augmented reality that exploits the concept of diminished reality and workers location detection will improve visibility during critical operations",

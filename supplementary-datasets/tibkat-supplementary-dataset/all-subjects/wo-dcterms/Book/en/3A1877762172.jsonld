            "abstract": "The world of clinical cardiac electrophysiology continues to evolve with newer and more advanced technologies to better serve our patients. In this book, titled The Role of the Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiologist in the Management of Congestive Heart Failure, authors from around the world have contributed their thoughts. Various chapters describing the use of biventricular pacing devices (CRT) in the management of patients suffering from systolic heart failure are included, with a chapter dedicated to management of CRT. A chapter describing the role of CRT in patients with Chagas disease is included. Authors describe the newer pharmaceuticals in the management of this disease and the role of catheter ablation in the management of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. These topics are of great interest to clinicians at the various levels of training, and I believe this textbook gives a flavor of the expanding role of the electrophysiologist in the management of an ever-expanding patient population",

Most of the materials processing and manufacturing techniques currently used in industries are a major cause of environmental pollution and are hence unsustainable. This book provides in-depth knowledge about challenges faced during the processing of advanced materials and discuss possible ways to achieve sustainability in manufacturing. This book Covers advances in cryogenic machining, optimization and economical and energy assessment of machining. Provides case studies and numerical design with analysis using computational fluid dynamics of minimum quantity lubrication mist droplets. Discusses reviews on metalworking fluids, laser micro-texturing, materials and manufacturing in sustainability, biofuels additives and nano-materials as well as additive manufacturing of waste plastic. Explores the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning based manufacturing techniques Covers the latest challenges and future trends in sustainable manufacturing. Sustainable Materials and Manufacturing Technologies is primarily written for senior undergraduate and graduate students, and for researchers in the field of mechanical, manufacturing, industrial, production engineering and material science\"--",

            "abstract": "This collection of essays brings together a set of new perspectives on the many liberation struggles in southern Africa, struggles that have continuing significance today. What links were there between different forms of struggle in the region? What was the wider context, including international solidarity work? What roles did different actors play in these struggles? Among the topics analysed are African National Congress operations in Zambia, Swaziland and Lesotho; the fate of the Pan-Africanist Congress; Muslim involvement in the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique; what happened in the camps of the South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation in Angola; and violent and non-violent struggles in the Eastern Cape in the 1980s. A number of chapters focus on anti-apartheid activities in Britain. Anyone interested in the complex nature of these struggles, and their local and global legacies, will find this collection, based on innovative research, essential reading",

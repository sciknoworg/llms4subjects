            "abstract": "Renewable energy is the answer for future energy demand. Renewable energy is the energy that occurs in a natural manner and utilizes unlimited resources. It is the solution for reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and diminishing greenhouse gas emission. It is the key for cleaner, greener, and sustainable energy. In today's world, increased energy needs and environmental and health concerns associated with traditional energy systems have made way for rapid progress in producing energy from renewable resources. However, large-scale integration of current technologies and newer approaches are still required for more efficient and cost-effective systems. This small book is a collection of single research chapters dealing with biofuel generation and some recent methods for grid integration and storage problems. The editors would like to record their sincere thanks to the authors for their contributions",

            "abstract": "This book is intended for systems analysts, designers, developers, users, experts, as well as those involved in quality, risk, safety and security management, and, of course, scientists and students. The various sets of original and traditional probabilistic models and interesting results of their applications to the research of different systems are presented. The models are understandable and applicable for solving system engineering problems: to optimize system requirements, compare different processes, rationale technical decisions, carry out tests, adjust technological parameters, and predict and analyze quality and risks. The engineering decisions, scientifically proven by the proposed models and software tools, can provide purposeful, essential improvement of quality and mitigation of risks, and reduce the expense of operating systems. Models, methods, and software tools can also be used in education for system analysis and mathematical modeling on specializations, for example \"\"systems engineering,\"\" \"\"operations research,\"\" \"\"enterprise management,\"\" \"\"project management,\"\" \"\"risk management,\"\" \"\"quality of systems,\"\" \"\"safety and security,\"\" \"\"smart systems,\"\" \"\"system of systems,\"\" etc",

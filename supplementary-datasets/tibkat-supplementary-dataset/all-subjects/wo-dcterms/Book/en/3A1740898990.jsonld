            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters CPCI-S (WoS).The degradation of materials and coatings in aggressive environments continues to be of great relevance to a wide range of industrial applications. The topic is of vital economic concern to the transportation, energy generation, and chemical processing industries in the developing, as well as the developed, nations of the world. The dual thrusts of conservation of resources and protection of the environment here strongly influence the tone of the technical submissions and thus again reflect the world-wide concern. The present 2-volume set focuses on Fundamental Aspects of High-Temperature Corrosion; Investigations of Alumina and Chromia Formers; High-Temperature Corrosion of Ceramics and Composites; Spalling and Mechanical Aspects of High-Temperature Corrosion Coatings and TBCs? Elaboration Methods and Experimental Techniques; Service Behavior and High-Temperature Corrosion in Complex Environments; Modeling. The main session comprised seven Plenary Lectures (\"The Future for High-Temperature Materials and Coatings in the New Millennium\"; \"Impurity Segregation to Scale/Alloy Interfaces and its Effect on Interfacial Properties\"; \"High Temperature Oxidation Kinetics of Non-Oxide Monolithic and Particulate Composite Ceramics\"; \"Carbon-Induced Corrosion of Metals and Alloys\"; \" Interactions between Oxidation and Deformation at High Temperature\"; \"Practical Aspects of the Reactive Element Effect\"; and \"Protection of Materials at High Temperature. What's Beyond Coatings\"), which set the tone and focal point for the subsequent sessions which were each introduced by two or more keynote lectures that highlighted special topics in each session and which were presented by well-known experts on that topic. All of the papers chosen for the Proceedings were subjected to thorough peer-review by members of the Advisory and Executive Committees, and conform to the standards of \"Materials Science Forum\". These Proceedings should serve as a firm basis for identifying future research directions in this economically critical area",

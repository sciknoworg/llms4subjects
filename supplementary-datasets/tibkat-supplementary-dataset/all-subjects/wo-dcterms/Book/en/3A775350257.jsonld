                "This special volume contains the proceedings of the Symposium held on June 26, 1988 at Williamsburg, Virginia, in honor of Professor Maurice Holt on the occasion of his seventieth birthday. There were more than two dozen participants from eleven countries. They were either his past students or his colleagues whose careers crossed his at some point. The twenty-one papers in this volume are the written version of the presentations at this Symposium; they are mostly in the area of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), a field in which Professor Holt is a pioneer. These papers cover almost all aspects of CFD including numerical analysis, symbolic analysis, and grid genera\u00ad tion. They cover diverse topics such as complex plume flows, shock waves and shock focussing, coronary circulation, free surface flows, direct containment heat\u00ad ing in nuclear reactors, and uranium enrichment. There is also an article on the progress and future directions in CFD by one of the true experts in this area. In addition to CFD papers, there is an experimental paper on the flow of spherical glass beads in airflow in a 90\u00b0 vertical-to-horizontal bend, as well as a historical paper on seventy years of fluid dynamic research at Aerodynamisches Institut at Aachen. It is worth pointing out that there is also an article on the simple fluid concept by a world-renowned authority on continuum mechanics.",

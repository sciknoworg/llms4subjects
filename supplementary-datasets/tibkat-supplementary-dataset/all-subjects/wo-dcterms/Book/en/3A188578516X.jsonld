            "title": "Indigenising Education and Citizenship : Perspectives on Policies and Practices From S\u00e1pmi and Beyond",
            "abstract": "This book is about Indigenous education and citizenship. Our center of attention is the politics of Indigenous education to be put into practice. We emphasise the processual aspects of both education and citizenship. We investigate how having both Indigenous and non- Indigenous citizens in nation state education systems is reflected in policy, pedagogy, and practice, and how to consider the implications for future forms of education and citizenship.  The book contributes to knowledge about Indigenous education as a field of research, policy, and practice around the world. To reach this goal, we examine the conceptual, political, and pedagogical issues relating to Indigenous citizenship and education in four different contexts, namely S\u00e1pmi, Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand, and Namibia.  Together, the contributors of the book come from different research disciplines, from Indigenous studies, education, and social anthropology to sociolinguistics, political science, and philosophy. The chapters highlight continua and diversity rather than dichotomies and unity. We look for how local practices relate to national and international demands and perspectives, and for different ways of performing citizenship. Together, we seek the connections between the local, the national and the international, and between educational policy and practice",

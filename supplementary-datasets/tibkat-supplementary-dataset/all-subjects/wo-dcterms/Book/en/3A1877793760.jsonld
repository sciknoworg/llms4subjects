            "abstract": "In this engaging book, Douglas Anderson begins with the assumption that philosophy\u2014the Greek love of wisdom\u2014is alive and well in American culture. At the same time, professional philosophy remains relatively invisible. Anderson traverses American life to find places in the wider culture where professional philosophy in the distinctively American tradition can strike up a conversation. How might American philosophers talk to us about our religious experience, or political engagement, or literature\u2014or even, popular music? Anderson\u2019s second aim is to find places where philosophy happens in nonprofessional guises\u2014cultural places such as country music, rock\u2019n roll, and Beat literature. He not only enlarges the tradition of American philosophers such as John Dewey and William James by examining lesser-known figures such as Henry Bugbee and Thomas Davidson, but finds the theme and ideas of American philosophy in some unexpected places, such as the music of Hank Williams, Tammy Wynette, and Bruce Springsteen, and the writings of Jack Kerouac. The idea of \u201cphilosophy Americana\" trades on the emergent genre of \u201cmusic Americana,\" rooted in traditional themes and styles yet engaging our present experiences. The music is \u201cpopular\" but not thoroughly driven by economic considerations, and Anderson seeks out an analogous role for philosophical practice, where philosophy and popular culture are co-adventurers in the life of ideas. Philosophy Americana takes seriously Emerson\u2019s quest for the extraordinary in the ordinary and James\u2019s belief that popular philosophy can still be philosophy",

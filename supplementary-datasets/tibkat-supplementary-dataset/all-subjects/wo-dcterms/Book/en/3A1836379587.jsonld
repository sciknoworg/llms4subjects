And I placed it under the auspices of H\u00f6lderlin, who may have only fled thought because he was unable to live it: \u2018The life of the spirit between friends, the thoughts that form in the exchange of words, by writing or in person, are necessary to those who seek. Without that, we are by our own hands outside thought.\u2019\u201d  What, in light of that imperative, is a correspondence? What is given to be understood by the word, let alone the phenomenon? What constitutes a correspondence? What occasions it? On what terms and according to what conditions may one enter into that exchange \u201cnecessary,\u201d in H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s words, \u201cto those who seek\u201d? Pursuant to what vicissitudes may it be conducted? And what end(s) might a correspondence come to have beyond the ostensible end that, to all appearances, it (inevitably) will be said to have had?",

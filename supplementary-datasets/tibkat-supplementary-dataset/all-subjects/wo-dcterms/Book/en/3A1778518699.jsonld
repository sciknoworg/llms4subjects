            "title": "Urban Agglomeration",
            "abstract": "People living in rural areas migrate to urban areas to secure better qualities of life, education, and health facilities and also because they believe that urban settings offer more livable conditions. These appealing features have led to rapid population growth in urban areas, which has resulted in problems that need to be solved through different urban planning and design approaches. In conjunction with this book, a supplemental resource, which both provides and proposes solutions based on innovative approaches to urbanization problems that emerge from urban agglomeration, has been created. This resource supplement shall also serve as a guide to future urban development efforts. In effect, this book will play an important role in compensating for the limited number of resource books on urbanization. This book is intended to be a reference source for scientists and students interested in the subject",

            "abstract": "The role of photography in U.S. migrant historiesSince the mid-nineteenth century photography has played a central role in cultural encounters within and between migrant communities in the United States. Migrant histories have been mediated through the photographic image, and the cultural practices of photography have themselves been transformed as migrant communities mobilise the photographic image to navigate experiences of cultural dislocation and the forging of new identities. Exploring photographic images and the cultural practices of photography as \u2018contact zones\u2019 through which cultural exchange and transformation takes place, this volume addresses the role of photography in migrant histories in the United States from the mid-nineteenth century to today. Taking as its focal point photography\u2019s role in shaping migrant experiences of cultural transformation, and how migrant experiences have re-configured culturally differentiated practices of photography, case studies on migration from Europe, Central America, and North America position photography as entwined with cultural histories of migration and cultural transformation in the United States.Contributors: Sarah Bassnett (Western University), David Bate (University of Westminster), Justin Carville (Institute of Art, Design & Technology, Dun Laoghaire), Erina Duganne (Texas State University), Orla Fitzpatrick (National Museum of Ireland), Bridget Gilman (Independent Scholar), Aleksandra Idzior (University of Fraser Valley), Alexandra Irimia (University of Western Ontario), Sandra Kri\u017ei\u0107 Roban (Institute of Art History, Zagreb), Sigrid Lien (University of Bergen), Helene Roth (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t Munich), Leslie Ure\u00f1a (Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery)",

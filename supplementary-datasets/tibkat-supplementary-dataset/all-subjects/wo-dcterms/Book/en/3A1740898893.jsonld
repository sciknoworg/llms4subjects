            "title": "Precision Machining of Advanced Materials",
            "abstract": "Precision machining is an essential manufacturing process to achieve high dimensional accuracy and high surface integrity of functional components for various technological applications, such as those in aeronautical, biomedical, mechanical, metrological, mechatronic, nano-technological and microscopy industries. To achieve a satisfactory operation of precision machining, however, one must have a deep understanding of the setting and control of machining conditions, mechanisms of material removal and effectiveness of the cutting tools. As a result, a quality precision machining requires a comprehensive integration of the development of machine tools, the improvement of machining methods and the wise application of materials science and engineering and mechanics of solids. This volume tends to present to the reader the state-of-the-art information about the recent research, development and applications on the precision machining of advanced materials. It covers three major aspects of precision machining, i.e., mechanisms of machining and material removal, friction and wear problems associated with cutting tools and development of new methods and new tools for more cost-effective processes.Individual materials have different properties and thus require different machining methods and conditions to achieve high surface integrity and accuracy. For example, silicon monocrystalls are brittle in nature and are chemically sensitive to machining environment. Composites have at least two phases with different mechanical properties. These need to be considered carefully in machining as otherwise unacceptable damage will take place in either the workpiece or the cutting tool or in both. The papers included in this volume deal with a wide range of difficult-to-machine materials, such as silicon, glass, carbon-fibre reinforced composites, CVD-SiC film and ceramics. The methodologies presented address both industrial production problems and fundamental issues, including polishing, grinding, electrochemical discharge machining, abrasive jet machining, laser sintering, chemo-mechanical machining, drilling, fractal analysis, molecular dynamics analysis and finite element simulation. The volume is therefore valuable to production and research engineers, research students and academics in the area",

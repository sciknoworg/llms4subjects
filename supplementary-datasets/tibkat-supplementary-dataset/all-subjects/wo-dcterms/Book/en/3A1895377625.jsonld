                "This open access book comes at an opportune time, with \u2018land take\u2019 high on the EU policy agenda. It shows how over one million hectares in Europe became urbanized between 2000 and 2018, over eight times that which changed back to agriculture or nature. This book seeks to explain this development and offer suggestions on how to control it, drawing on the ESPON Sustainable Urbanization and land-use Practices in European Regions (SUPER) project. It presents up-to-date analyses on urbanization rates (land take) as well as densities and morphology (sprawl). It also discusses the impact of spatial planning instruments and other public-sector interventions. Finally, the book peers into the future by drawing up urbanization scenarios \u2013 compact, polycentric, and diffuse \u2013 for 2050, and reflects on their sustainability. It concludes with the encouraging message that policy can make a positive difference. David Evers is a senior researcher at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), lecturer in planning at the University of Amsterdam, and the ESPON contact point for the Netherlands.

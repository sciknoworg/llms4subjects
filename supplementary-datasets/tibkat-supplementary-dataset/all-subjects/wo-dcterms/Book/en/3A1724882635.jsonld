            "title": "Papua Public Expenditure Analysis",
            "abstract": "Papua has abundant natural and fiscal resources but also faces great development challenges. On the one hand, Papua currently has the largest per capita fiscal capacity after West Papua. Papua is rich in natural resources such as non-oil-and-gas minerals and forest products. On the other hand, development challenges in Papua are significant, including geography, terrain and demography. In general, Papua is still underdeveloped both socially and in economic terms compared to other regions in Indonesia. This underdevelopment is evident in most poverty, education, health, and infrastructure indicators. The economy and investment in Papua are dominated by the mining sector and, in a distant second place, the agricultural sector. Between 2004 and 2007, the mining sector accounted for more than 50 percent of the Papua's gross regional domestic product (GRDP). As a consequence, economic growth was determined by fluctuations in mineral commodity prices. The second largest sector is agriculture, which accounts for about 14-18 percent of GRDP. This sector absorbed the most workers in Papua province until 2008. Meanwhile, industry continues to lag and contributed less than 10 percent to GRDP. The PEA is a part of the PEACH (Public Expenditure Analysis and Capacity Harmonization) program. This program is an initiative of the Government of Papua to continuously improve its public financial management performance. Consequently, the analysis contained in this report addresses issues that are the region's main focus. Today, the Government of Papua is trying actively to achieve a 'New Papua' through implementing the following agenda: a) restructuring the local government; b) developing a prosperous Papua; c) developing a safe and peaceful Papua; and d) improving and accelerating the development of basic infrastructure and facilities",

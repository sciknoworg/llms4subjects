            "abstract": "Over the last two decades, Moldova has achieved major development results: with average annual growth of 4.6 percent since 2000, poverty has decreased dramatically, and the growth has also benefitted more citizens: Inequality, as measured by the Gini Index, has declined from 36.4 in 2000 to 26.3 in 2016. Macroeconomic stability has been maintained despite the 2014 banking crisis, and monetary and the exchange rate policies have led to a declining inflation protecting the living standard of Moldova's citizens. The country has benefitted from its unique assets, such as a strategic European location and growing global integration. The authorities' focus on investment policy put the country on investors' map: commitment demonstrated in investment promotion and the level of service and attention that was given to investors led to attracting manufacturing FDI. They on the other hand helped reorient exports towards more technology-intensive products and allowed for a stronger contribution of exports to growth and employment generation. Moldova has also significantly reformed its business environment, ranking today 47th of the 190 countries measured on ease of doing business. There was also effort to improve the quality of human capital. The education system reform led to improvement of student learning outcomes in Moldova, as measured by the Program for International Students Assessment (PISA), although there are still major gaps in learning outcomes that need to be addressed. The preprimary enrollment rates increased substantially, and labor force participation rate increased to historical highs, albeit at 43 percent still comparatively low",

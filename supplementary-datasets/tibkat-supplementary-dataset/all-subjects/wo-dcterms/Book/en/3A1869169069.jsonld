            "abstract": "This study aims at evaluating the impact of educational mismatch onto firm-level productivity for a large set of Italian firms. In particular, over (under)-education refers to situations where individual\u2019s educational attainment is higher (lower) than the education required by the job, thereby producing a surplus (deficit) of education. Based on the integration of the LEED (Linked Employer Employee Database) Istat Statistical Register Asia Occupazione \u2013 which provides information on workers\u2019 age, professional qualification and educational attainment \u2013 and the Istat Frame-SBS Register, we perform an analysis in the spirit of the ORU (Over, Required and Under Education) model proposed by Kampelmann e Rycx (2012). The dataset is based on a large panel of over 55,000 manufacturing and services firms with more than 20 employees, covering the 2014-2019 period. The empirical strategy is based on a two-step procedure: first, ORU indicators are computed at the worker-level; second, we estimate a firm-level productivity (value added per employee) function where the key variables of interest are the ORU indicators collapsed at the firm-level, taking into account both firm and workers characteristics. The productivity function is estimated by GMM-system by Arellano and Bond (1995) e Blundell and Bond (1988). Main results point out that over/under-education affects productivity growth in both manufacturing and services firms: firm\u2019s productivity rises following a one unit increase in mean years of over-education \u2013 with spiking results for medium and high-tech manufacturing firms \u2013, whereas a growth in under-education hampers productivity dynamics in high and medium-high tech manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services firms",

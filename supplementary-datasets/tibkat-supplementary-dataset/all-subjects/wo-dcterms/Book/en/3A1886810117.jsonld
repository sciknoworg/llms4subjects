                "Health and wellness foods, snacks and beverages are of increasing importance to manufacturers as consumer interest in healthy lifestyles and the demand for healthier products and services continue to escalate. Transparency of the supply chain, traceability of the ingredients and processing methods and sustainability are the major concerns for modern consumers. Incorporating new ingredients with traditional products is an important strategy for the food industry to reformulate healthier and value-added foods, with the heart of health and wellness food products being flavoring ingredients, which deliver food and drink formats tasting just like the beloved original food products. To meet the growth of health and wellness food products in the market, new opportunities for flavor suppliers will include flavor raw materials and their applications in food products. Flavor-Associated Applications in Health and Wellness Food Products focuses on flavor and its application in health and wellness food products. The first section comprehensively covers the role of flavor in health and wellness products, while the second focuses on flavoring labels, ingredient suitability and safety with specific case studies. Further sections focus on sugar, fat, salt and alcohol reduction, flavor solutions for plant-based protein, flavor perception and direct health benefits. With no book on the current market focusing on health and wellness foods from a flavor perspective, this work is a valuable single source for product developers, manufacturers and researchers in need of a comprehensive summary of key recent developments regarding flavor-associated applications in health and wellness food products. ."

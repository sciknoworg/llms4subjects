            "title": "Gamma Rays : Current Insights",
            "abstract": "Gamma rays are positioned distinctively in the electromagnetic spectrum, characterized by energy over 100 keV and wavelengths less than 10 picometers. Paul Villard discovered them in 1900, and their ability to penetrate deeply was quickly recognized. The discovery of artificial radioactivity in 1934 by Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot significantly increased the availability of gamma-ray sources. This established the foundation for their extensive utilization. Currently, gamma rays are widely utilized in several fields of science, industry, medicine, and beyond. Notable uses encompass radionuclide exploration, radiation-based treatment of materials, sterilization of medical products, medical imaging, cancer therapy, and food sterilization through irradiation. Nevertheless, numerous applications are still being actively studied as researchers persist in discovering novel methods to utilize gamma rays in various fields. This book includes five chapters, each dedicated to elucidating recent advancements in applying gamma rays within a particular domain. The subjects addressed encompass a broad spectrum, including mineral discovery, crop development, insect management, and improvement of food quality. The chapters focus on innovative methodologies, methodological advancements, and practical obstacles to efficiently utilizing gamma rays. The chapters provide valuable insights informing readers about the advances in many application domains during the past decade. In general, the volume demonstrates the diverse usefulness of gamma rays in several scientific fields and technological endeavors. The statement underscores that despite being identified more than a century ago, gamma rays remain a dynamic study area with significant potential for present and future applications. This book will appeal to students, academics, and professionals looking to thoroughly examine the various uses of gamma rays in contemporary society",

                "The International Conference \"Solar Energy for Development\" was held from the 26th to the 29th of March 1979 in Varese, Italy. The Conference was organised by the Commission of the European Communities to assess the potential of solar energy for meeting the needs in the developing countries, particularly in their rural areas. The objectives of the Conference were threefold: - To review those solar energy technologies which are appropriate for large scale utilisation in the short and medium term; - To appraise problems which may be alleviated by a better use of conventional solar energy and the introduction of appropriate new solar technologies; - To recommend ways and means of extending the use of solar energy, taking into account technical and non-technical criteria. Before the Conference, in September and October 1978, five regional solar energy seminars were held in Nairobi (East Africa), Bamako (West Africa), Amman (Arab countries), Caracas (Latin America) and New Delhi (South and South-East Asia). With the help of the experts at these seminars a general working document was established and made available to the participants of the Conference. 280 experts from 80 countries all over the world were invited by the Commission to attend the Conference. The United Nations and 11 other regional and international organisa\u00ad tions were represented. The Conference was opened by Dr. Guido Brunner, Member of the Commission responsible for Energy, Research, Science and Education, in the presence of Dr."

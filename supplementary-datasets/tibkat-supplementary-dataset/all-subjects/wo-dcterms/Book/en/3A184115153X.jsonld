            "abstract": "This chapter sets out the integrated guidance approach and explores its potential to transform the way in which career education and guidance is delivered in higher education. Integrated guidance is an approach which makes effective use of digital technologies. It is comprised of an ontological basis informed by critical social justice, a pedagogic basis informed by social learning theories and an approach to instructional design which explores the affordances offered by different technologies and approaches and sequences them using pedagogic models derived from Salmon and others. The approach is illustrated by a detailed hypothetical case study which is returned to repeatedly throughout the chapter",

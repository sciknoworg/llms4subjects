                "In recent years, increasing numbers of articles and studies have emerged across the disciplines of economics, accounting, finance and management to examine the importance of considering both the private and social economic benefits of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). As stakeholders and their concerns have multiplied, and empirical evidence has accumulated, CSR has become a critical area of interest. This authoritative collection examines the five related and most significant elements of this subject - theoretical perspectives, firm financial performance, socially responsible investing, environmental performance and strategic CSR - to provide a comprehensive exploration of the literature on Corporate Social Responsibility and its economic consequences"

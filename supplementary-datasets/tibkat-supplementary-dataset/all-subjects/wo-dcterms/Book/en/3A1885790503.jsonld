            "abstract": "Collective monograph highlights the results of systematic scientific research devoted to some innovative technological solutions in materials science. The practical application of the results of these studies covers electronic equipment, light industry, construction, and rocketry.  Chapter 1 examines the problem of obtaining radiation-protective coatings based on epoxy composites for electronic equipment materials. Dependences of the electron concentration, specific conductivity, and Hall EMF on the induction of external magnetic field for the n-Si and n-Ge single crystals, irradiated by the fast electrons, coated with a layer of ED-20 epoxy resin, have been obtained. The composite layer was without fillers and with iron and aluminum powders as fillers. It has been shown that the presence of such a coating layer increases the radiation resistance of n-Si and n-Ge single crystals, and the greatest radiation resistance is achieved by silicon and germanium single crystals coated with an epoxy composite with an iron powder filler. The determined presence of the residual magnetization of the iron powder filler and the corresponding induced additional Hall EMF may be of practical importance in the development of energy storage systems based on irradiated n-Ge and n-Si single crystals covered with a layer of epoxy resin with iron powder filler.  Chapter 2 is devoted to the development of nanopigments based on modified montmorillonite for the formation of polymer-mineral decoration of natural leather. An algorithm for obtaining nanopigments by successive modification of aqueous dispersions of montmorillonite with cationically active and anionically active compounds has been proposed. The composition of coating compositions with the use of nanopigments has been optimized and rational ratios of the components of the coating composition have been obtained, which ensure the formation of a polymer-mineral coating with the required level of operational properties. It has been proven that the use of nanopigments in the composition of coating compositions allows to reduce the consumption of coating paint for decoration, the thickness of the coating film and to obtain a coating with high quality indicators in terms of adhesion to dry and wet skin, resistance of the coating to multiple bends, dry and wet friction.  Chapter 3 analyzes the modern level of the technology of coating processes on a vertical surface, which actualizes the study of the problem of improving the operational properties of an anti-corrosion coating. The dependence of the effective application of anti-corrosion coatings and their physical and mechanical properties on the technological parameters has been determined. An automated unit for applying protective anti-corrosion coatings and removable nozzles to it for performing work in hard-to-reach places has been proposed. The practical significance of the obtained results lies in the determination of specific technological parameters and cleaning modes, when applying a film coating on a vertical surface, in particular in hard-to-reach places.  In chapter 4, the possibility of using polymers as a structural material for creating the bodies of launch vehicles, as well as solid fuel for rocket engines is considered. Research is related to the development of a new type of ultralight launch vehicles: combustible or autophagic launch vehicles. The thermophysical and mechanical characteristics of various types of polymers have been analyzed from the point of view of the possibility of their use as structural materials for the bodies of ultralight missile carriers. The results of theoretical and experimental studies of thermal destruction of polymer materials under aerodynamic heating conditions are presented. It is shown that polymer materials, in particular polyethylene, under suitable conditions, can be used to make fuel tanks for solid-fuel rockets that use a new principle of burning the structure during flight. The development of such launch vehicles and the commercialization of scientific research in this area will allow domestic companies in the aerospace industry to occupy a niche in the market for launching small satellites.  The monograph is intended for theoreticians and practitioners involved in the development and implementation of alloys, as well as their manufacturing technologies for various operational applications, which can provide an opportunity to increase the competitiveness of enterprise products",

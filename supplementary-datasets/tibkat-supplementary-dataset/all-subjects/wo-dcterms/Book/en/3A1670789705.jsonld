                "Candidate-centric recruiters beat robots -- Show you are a recruiter worth talking to -- What about your hiring managers? -- Show you are a company worth talking to -- Get your intake right -- Human-first job posts and advertisements -- Robot-proof messaging -- Applications and pain-free interviews -- No more non-boarding -- Referrals depend on you.",
                "\"In a world of work where recruiters are constantly hearing that their role is at risk from AI, robotics and chatbots, effectively attracting and recruiting the right people has never been more important. Leveraging the power of social media and digital sourcing strategies is only part of the solution and simply posting a job on Facebook or sending a LinkedIn InMail is no longer enough. The Robot-Proof Recruiter shows recruiters how to use the tools that reveal information that can be used to grab a potential candidate's attention in the overwhelming volume of information online. Full of expert guidance and practical tips, this book explains what works, what doesn't and how you can stand out and recruit effectively in a world of technology overload. The Robot-Proof Recruiter will enable readers to become the recruiters that candidates trust and the ones that they want to talk to. With essential guidance on how to overcome obstacles including how to recruit without an existing social media presence and for new companies without an established reputation as well as how to avoid becoming overwhelmed by social media, this is an indispensable book for all recruitment professionals and HR practitioners looking to recruit the right people for their organisation\"--"

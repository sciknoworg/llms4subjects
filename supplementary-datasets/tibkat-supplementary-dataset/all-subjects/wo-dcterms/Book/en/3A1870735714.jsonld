                "This book is about improving human decision making and performance in complex tasks. Utilizing systems thinking approach, this book presents innovative and insightful solutions to various managerial issues in various domains including agriculture, education, climate change, digital transformation, health care, supply chains, and sustainability. Practical insights and operational causal models are systematically presented. The key features of the didactic approach of this book are core knowledge, numerous tables and figures throughout the text, system archetypes, and causal loop models. This book serves as a text for college and university courses on Systems Thinking for Management Decision Making in Complex Tasks. Researchers use the developed \u201ccausal models\u201d to design and evaluate various decision-aiding technologies. It is used as a source of practical information for a broad community of decision-makers, researchers, and practitioners concerned with the issue of improving human performance in complex organizational tasks."

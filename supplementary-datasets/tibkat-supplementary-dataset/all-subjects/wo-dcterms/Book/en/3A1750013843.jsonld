                "This book compellingly illustrates how the transition to renewable and nuclear energy may fundamentally change the energy system dynamics of a region that has long been known for hydrocarbon-dependence and political strife. \u2013Steve Griffiths, Senior Vice President, Research and Development, Professor of Practice, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates This book is an essential guide for policy makers, analysts and academics trying to make sense of the dynamics, policies and motives driving the change to a more sustainable energy future in the MENA region. \u2013Catherine Dourian, Regional Manager, Middle East and Gulf for the World Energy Council If you want to know how the global march towards greening our energy is impacting the Middle East and North Africa region, this book is a must-read. \u2013Carole Nakhle, CEO, Crystol Energy This book explores the evolving roles of energy stakeholders and geopolitical considerations, leveraging on the dizzying array of planned and actual projects for solar, wind, hydropower, waste-to-energy, and nuclear power in the Middle East and North Africa. Over the next few decades, favorable economics for low carbon energy sources combined with stagnant oil demand growth will facilitate a shift away from today\u2019s fossil fuel-based energy system. Will the countries of the MENA be losers or leaders in this energy transition? Will state\u2013society relations undergo a change as a result? It suggests that ultimately, politics more so than economics or environmental pressure will determine the speed, scope, and effects of low carbon energy uptake in the region. This book is of interest to graduate students and academics working in the fields of International Relations, International Political Economy, Comparative Political Economy, Energy Economics, and International Business. Consultants, practitioners, policy-makers, and risk analysts will also find the insights helpful. Robin Mills is CEO of Qamar Energy and Fellow at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy and author of two books, The Myth of the Oil Crisis and Capturing Carbon. Li-Chen Sim is Assistant Professor at Khalifa University of Science and Technology in the United Arab Emirates. Her most recent books are The Rise & Fall of Privatization in the Russian Oil Industry and External Powers and the Gulf Monarchies."

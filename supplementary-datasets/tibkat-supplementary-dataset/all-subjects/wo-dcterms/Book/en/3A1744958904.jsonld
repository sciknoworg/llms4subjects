                "Wearable Sensors: Fundamentals, Implementation and Applications has been written by a collection of experts in their field, who each provide you with an understanding of how to design and work with wearable sensors. Together these insights provide the first single source of information on wearable sensors that would be a fantastic addition to the library of any engineers working in this field.Wearable Sensors covers a wide variety of topics associated with development and applications of wearable sensors. It also provides an overview and a coherent summary of many aspects of wearable sensor technology. Both professionals in industries and academic researchers need this package of information in order to learn the overview and each specific technology at the same time. This book includes the most current knowledge on the advancement of light-weight hardware, energy harvesting, signal processing, and wireless communications and networks",
                "- Provides a full revision of the first edition, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date resource of all currently used wearable devices in an accessible and structured manner- Helps engineers manufacture wearable devices with information on current technologies, with a focus on end user needs and recycling requirements- This book provides a fully updated overview of the many aspects of wearable sensor technology in one single volume, enabling engineers and researchers to fully comprehend the field and to identify opportunities",
                "Practical problems with smart fabrics, biomonitoring and health informatics are all addressed, plus end user centric design, ethical and safety issues. The new edition is completely reviewed by key figures in the field, who offer authoritative and comprehensive information on the various topics. A new feature for the second edition is the incorporation of key background information on topics to allow the less advanced user access to the field and to make the title more of an auto-didactic book for undergraduates"

            "abstract": "Hemodialysis (HD) is the commonest form of kidney replacement therapy worldwide with a prevalence rate close to 90%. Despite significant improvements in HD techniques and related devices and solutions, the cardiovascular and all-cause mortality of HD patients remains unacceptably elevated. More recently, there have been significant improvements in the creation and maintenance of vascular access as well as the knowledge of types, classification, and monitoring of uremic toxins and their relationship with inflammation, atherosclerosis and vascular classification, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. More interesting is the innovation in dialysis membranes/dialyzers, which resulted in the creation of the medium cut-off membrane, which enables the safe, simple, and effective removal of middle- and large-sized uremic toxins. This type of HD treatment is called expanded hemodialysis (HDx) therapy, which so far has resulted in significant improvement in the quality of life of HD patients as well as reductions in hospitalization, medications, and non-fatal cardiovascular events. Updates on Hemodialysis discusses these innovations and how they can be used to improve daily practice and achieve the best possible medical outcomes in HD patients",

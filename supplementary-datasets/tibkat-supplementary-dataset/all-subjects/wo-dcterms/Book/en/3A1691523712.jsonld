                "At the core of institutional theories, \u2018values\u2019 is a central term and figures in most definitions; however it remains understudied and under-explored. The editors of this open access book identify a resurgence of interest in the values-construct which underpins discussions of identity, \u2018ethos\u2019 and the purpose/nature of public and civic welfare provision. Considering the importance of values and values work to social, material and symbolic work in organizations, individual chapters explore values work as performed in organizations and by leaders. Focusing on practices of values work, the book applies and combines different theoretical lenses exemplified by the integration of institutional perspectives with micro-level perspectives and approaches.

Gry Espedal is Associate Professor at VID Specialized University, and holds a Master of Management. She researches values work in institutions and processes of institutionalization in organizations pressured by changing macro-contexts.

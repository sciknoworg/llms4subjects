            "abstract": "The present study is devoted to theoretical and practical problems of geological mapping of the sea floor. The objective of the work is to give, in a relatively small volume, an introduction to geological mapping procedures at continental margins, as well as some practical recommendations taking as an example the African region which is the least studied regions of the world. Geological mapping, including mapping of the ocean floor, is the first necessary step to a prognoses of the existence of different mineral deposits; it serves also as a basis to their prospecting. In the first place it is applied to so called sedimentary mineral deposits such as construction materials, heavy minerals, phosphates, etc. Marine geological mapping requires knowledge of the main environmental processes which form bottom sediments and determine their composition. Hence the initial section of this work on basis for the following chapters which are devoted to mapping techniques and sediment nomenclature. The reader will find here the principles for analytical mapping using quantitative methods for the measuring of those parameters which determine the concerned types of sediment. The paper also gives rules for sediment classification and nomenclature. The closing chapters are devoted to the distribution and composition of bottom sediments near the shores of Africa, the modern and ancient relationships between sediments and the environment, as well as other topics.

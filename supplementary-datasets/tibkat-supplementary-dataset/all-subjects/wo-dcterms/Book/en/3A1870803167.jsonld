            "abstract": "\"The investigation on novel optical materials with unprecedented optical properties is of paramount importance for the development of advanced applications in many fields having a strong impact on our everyday lives such as biomedicine, food and agriculture security, optical communication and information technology, etc. Moreover, the interaction of light with matter in the past decades has allowed the quick growth of new disciplines such as biophotonics, covering all aspects of this interaction with biological materials; nanophotonics, investigating the optical behavior of nanostructures; opto-mechanics, going from optical manipulation of small objects to optical control of micro- and nano-robots. This book comprises timely contributions from active research groups covering several classes of materials and processes including nano-structured plasmonic and photonic materials, 2-D materials, photo-polymers, liquid crystals, photo-sensitive and opto-thermal, and other specially engineered materials. Novel Optical Materials will serve as a useful reference for researchers, engineers, and optical and materials scientists in both industry and academia. It is also an excellent supplement and reference for graduate courses in materials science, physics, and optical engineering\"--",

            "abstract": "This This chapter reads Beckett\u2019s fascination with what Steven Connor has called \u2018slow going\u2019 alongside Rob Nixon\u2019s description of the \u2018slow violence\u2019 of climate breakdown. Following Nixon\u2019s suggestion that \u2018slow violence\u2019 does not register readily in narratives and temporalities of crisis, I examine Beckett\u2019s attention to what remains in a paradoxically stuck and ongoing time. Suggesting that Beckett\u2019s work sticks with and witnesses catastrophe rather than crisis, the chapter uses The Lost Ones to explore Beckett\u2019s commitment to staying with a disaster that cannot be overcome, alongside the articulation of a giving up that is not a decision but part of a drive to go on. Using Beckett\u2019s interest in Freud\u2019s death drive, I suggest that Beckett\u2019s later texts work through materialisations of attachment and dependence as a way of thinking with and living with, rather than denying or repressing, the reality of the \u2018nothing to be done\u2019",

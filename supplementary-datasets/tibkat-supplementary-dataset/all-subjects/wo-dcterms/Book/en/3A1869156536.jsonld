            "abstract": "Teacher\u2019s well-being has become a priority in the last two decades. If we believe that schools have a role in promoting the mental health and students\u2019 well-being, we must first recognize and address the raising matter of teachers\u2019 mental health and well-being. Research shows that there is a straight connection between teachers\u2019 well-being and their social and emotional competences (Collie, 2017; Schonert-Reichl, 2017). Reflective teaching is the tool that we use to develop a model of intervention to promote teachers\u2019 well-being, and the model is supported on a social constructivist perspective. Reflective teaching is a process through which teachers think over their teaching practices, analysing how something had been taught and how the practice might be improved or changed for better learning outcomes. The teacher\u2019s continuous training model for professional development and well-being enlarges the emphasis on teachers\u2019 practices/experiences and connect them with meaningful situations, accentuating social and emotional competences to improve teachers\u2019 professional attainment and effectiveness. Processes of self-observation and self-evaluation based on reflective inquiry, and reflection on practice support the practical application of the model. Research also shows that well-being and job satisfaction strongly influence teachers\u2019 behaviours, which affect classroom climate and students\u2019 achievement as well (Collie et al.,2015; Van Dick et al., 2007). This teacher\u2019s continuous training model agglomerates several theoretical constructs relevant to pedagogy and may constitute a good practice for the promotion of teachers\u2019 professional development and well-being",

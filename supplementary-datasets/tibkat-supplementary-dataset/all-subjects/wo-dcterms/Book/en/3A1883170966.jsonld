            "abstract": "Framing Ageing, available open access, addresses scholars from across the Humanities and Social Sciences who want to approach the urgent topic of old age in their work, mapping the intellectual state of the field and putting the most salient concepts in action.  Bringing together established and emerging scholars of old age from the humanities and social sciences as well as gerontologists and medical practitioners, this open access book showcases new scholarship and provides new methods and terms for ongoing conversations about old age as an object of analysis in contemporary culture.    Cultural policy makers and scholars alike regularly describe a \"visibility crisis\" of old age, a consistent erasure or repression of images of older people from public view. Co-edited by an art historian and two literary scholars with a shared interest in memory, Framing Ageing examines the in/visibility of old age from a range of disciplinary angles, including philosophy, social history, comparative literature and anthropology. In addition to examining literary texts, this volume includes a chapter in graphic form and carries out innovative analyses of film, the built environment, fine art and commercial images.

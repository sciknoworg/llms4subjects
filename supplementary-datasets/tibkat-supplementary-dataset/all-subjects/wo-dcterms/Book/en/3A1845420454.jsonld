            "abstract": "For students taking courses in educational administration and leadership. An authoritative and timely examination of organizational behavior and how leaders can create effective school cultures.  Well-established as a standard textbook in the preparation of effective and thoughtful school administrators, Organizational Behavior in Education continues its tradition of offering students of educational administration the most current thinking and the most in-depth exploration of organizational leadership as it relates to decision-making, organizational change, managing conflict, and motivating others. As readers are challenged to develop and analyze the successful implementation of school reform, they gain a professional understanding of the organizational theory and research that are the bedrock of modern practice.  The thoroughly revised tenth edition of Organizational Behavior in Education updates the research and theory behind organizational effectiveness in schools as it pertains to change, leadership, and new issues in school reform including comprehensive school reform models, charter schools, and school vouchers. This new material contains current emerging developments in the fast-paced world of contemporary school reform and keeps students abreast of emerging trends",

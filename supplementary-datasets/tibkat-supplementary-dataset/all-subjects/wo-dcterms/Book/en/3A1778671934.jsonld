            "abstract": "What is a fuckhead? David Rawson\u2019s Fuckhead is a surreal exploration of the literature, film, nature and expectations of disability, and of fuckheads in literature and film. Part lyric essay, part fictional memoir, Rawson\u2019s work tells the story of an unnamed narrator whose familial relationships are defined by his VATER syndrome. Abused by his mother and stripped of a voice by his brother\u2019s need to be Tom Cruise via Rain Man, he sets out into a universe of literary tropes. I have always been of the mind that the novelist is allowed access to all experiences, as long as he ultimately has something to say. Plutarch and Samuel Johnson are typing somewhere in the desert of the next world, composing the ultimate collection of biographical criticism, explaining how David Lynch\u2019s entire filmography owes a debt to his club feet. But I and the friends who bought my novel agree the author is dead. The work is particularly interested in the relationship between Steinbeck\u2019s Of Mice and Men and what the narrator argues is Denis Johnson\u2019s reimagining of that work in the short story \u201cEmergency\u201d (in Johnson\u2019s Jesus\u2019 Son). But in accumulating characters with disabilities as widely diverse as Darth Vader, Benjy of Faulkner\u2019s The Sound and the Fury, and the TV sitcom Community\u2019s Abed Nadir, Rawson movingly, and with wry humor, articulates the assumptions and clich\u00e9s faced by persons with disabilities, all the while creating a new family with his unlikely gathering of \u201cfuckheads.\u201d",

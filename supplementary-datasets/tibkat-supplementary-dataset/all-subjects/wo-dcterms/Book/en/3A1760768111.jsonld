                "Meng-Jiao Wang, D. Sci. is a distinguished scientist in the field of elastomer science and technology, with a wide range of academic and practical experience In his 45-year R&D career, he has published approximately 140 papers and nine book chapters, co-authored seven books, and translated five books on rubber science and technology. He owns 33 U.S. patents and 15 international equivalent patents. Up until his retirement, he was a scientific fellow at Cabot Corporation, engaged in research and development of rubber fillers and basic research of rubber reinforcement. Previously, he worked for the Institute of Rubber Technology (DIK) in Hannover, Germany, and for Degussa AG as a senior scientist, studying rubber-filler interaction and developing new tire materials. He was also a visiting scientist at the University of Akron, OH. He holds a doctorate from the Universit\u00e9 de Haute Alsace, France and his undergraduate study was in chemistry at Shandong University, China. Michael Morris is Principal Scientist at Cabot Corporation, Billerica, MA, where he has worked for over 24 years. He was previously Senior Scientist at the Tun Abdul Razak Research Centre in Hertford, UK. He holds a Ph.D. from the University of Southampton, UK.",
                "In the rubber industry, one of the most widely practiced processes is the reinforcement of rubber by particulate fillers, especially carbon black and silica. This process is of such importance that more than 99% of rubber products contain fillers, and the research and development of fillers have become the most widely researched area in rubber science and technology. This book covers the most important theoretical and practical aspects of rubber reinforcement, such as filler basic properties and their characterization methods, the effect of fillers in polymers, the processability of compounds, and the properties of filled vulcanizates. Special chapters deal with applications of fillers in tires and industrial rubber goods and the reinforcement of silicone rubbers. Testing methods and their principles, applications, and limitations are reviewed, with emphasis on the surface activity, widely accepted as the \u201cthird dimension\u201d of filler characterization, after particle size and structure. This has not been described in depth in other books on rubber reinforcement. The effects of fillers on rubber and their mechanisms, which are important links between filler properties and the performance of rubber goods, are explained. A guide for selecting the most appropriate reinforcing systems for specific applications is provided, taking into account processabilities and properties of filled compounds and performance of rubber products. With solutions to many practical problems related to rubber research and compounding, this book serves as a valuable companion to engineers and product developers in the rubber industry, material scientists, and teachers and students in material science and rubber courses."

                "This book considers new analytics and AI approaches in the areas of inventory control, logistics, and supply chain management. It provides valuable insights for the retailers and managers to improve business operations and make more realistic and better decisions. It also offers a number of smartly designed strategies related to inventory control and supply chain management for the optimal ordering and delivery policies. The book further uses detailed models and AI computing approaches for demand forecasting to planning optimization and digital execution tracking. One of its key features is use of real-life examples, case studies, practical models to ensure adoption of new solutions, data analytics, and AI-lead automation methodologies are included. The book can be utilized by retailers and managers to improve business operations and make more accurate and realistic decisions. The AI-based solution, agnostic assessment, and strategy will support the companies for better alignment and inventory control and capabilities to create a strategic road map for supply chain and logistics. The book is also useful for postgraduate students, researchers, and corporate executives. It addresses novel solutions for inventory to real-world supply chain and logistics that retailers, practitioners, educators, and scholars will find useful. It provides the theoretical and applicable subject matters for the senior undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, practitioners, and professionals in the area of artificial intelligent computing and its applications in inventory and supply chain management, inventory control, and logistics. ."

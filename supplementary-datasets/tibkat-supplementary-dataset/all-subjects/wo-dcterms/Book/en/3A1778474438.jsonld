            "abstract": "The first of two studies included is \u201cMusic in Kelantan, Malaysia and Some of Its Cultural Implications,\u201d by William P. Malm. Kelantan is the northernmost province on the east coast of Malaysia. It is considered to be the most orthodox area in a nation whose state religion is Islam. At the same time it must be noted that it borders to the north with the Buddhist country of Thailand and to the west is the Malaysian province of Perak whose jungles and mountains contain many \u201cpagan\u201d tribal traditions. Beyond Perak is Kedah with its larger Indian and Chinese populations and to the south is Trengganu where some Indonesian traits are still to be found. It is in this context that Malm\u2019s study of music is made.  The second study is \u201cProfessional Malay Story-Telling: Some Questions of Style and Presentation\u201d by Amin Sweeney. In view of the hitherto almost exclusive concern with the content of such tales as those of Sang Kanchil or Pak Pandir, Sweeney throws some light on the form, style, and presentation of oral Malay literature, with special reference to that class of story-telling popularly known as penglipur lara, or what Winstedt termed \u201cfolk romances.\u201d",

Adobe Muse can be a complicated program, and web design itself is no easy task, although your clients might think so. This book takes you from the initial design and layout stage right up to helping you publish your beautifully designed and richly developed site. Each chapter covers a different section of the website and, in turn, introduces the tools and features of the program, accompanied by useful tips and tricks that help you speed up your workflow. Follow along as a website is created from concept to execution and rich content such as slideshows, galleries, and social media are incorporated. See how each aspect of a website is created with Muse; watch as it's published; and visit the final version after learning how it was made. If seeing a website created start to finish wasn't enough, this book also features: - Tips on how to incorporate Photoshop into Muse - A companion website that was created with Muse where you can get up-to-the-minute coverage on Muse and other tutorials to help you design the perfect website Through this perfect blend of instruction and inspiration, you'll be up and running with Adobe Muse in no time\"--",

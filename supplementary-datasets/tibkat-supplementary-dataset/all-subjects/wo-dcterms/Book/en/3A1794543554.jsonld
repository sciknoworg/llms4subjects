            "abstract": "The intersection of food and immigration in North America, from the macroscale of national policy to the microscale of immigrants' lived, daily foodways. This volume considers the intersection of food and immigration at both the macroscale of national policy and the microscale of immigrant foodways\u2014the intimate, daily performances of identity, culture, and community through food. Taken together, the chapters\u2014which range from an account of the militarization of the agricultural borderlands of Yuma, Arizona, to a case study of Food Policy Council in Vancouver, Canada\u2014demonstrate not only that we cannot talk about immigration without talking about food but also that we cannot talk about food without talking about immigration. The book investigates these questions through the construct of the immigrant-food nexus, which encompasses the constantly shifting relationships of food systems, immigration policy, and immigrant foodways. The contributors, many of whom are members of the immigrant communities they study, write from a range of disciplines. Three guiding themes organize the chapters: borders\u2014cultural, physical, and geopolitical; labor, connecting agribusiness and immigrant lived experience; and identity narratives and politics, from \u201clocal food\u201d to \u201cdietary acculturation.\u201d Contributors Julian Agyeman, Alison Hope Alkon, Fernando J.

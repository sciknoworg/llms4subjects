                "This textbook is a step-by-step guide for high school, community college, or undergraduate students who are taking a course in applied statistics and wish to learn how to use Excel to solve statistical problems. All of the statistics problems in this book will come from the following fields of study: business, education, psychology, marketing, engineering and advertising. Students will learn how to perform key statistical tests in Excel without being overwhelmed by statistical theory. Each chapter briefly explains a topic and then demonstrates how to use Excel commands and formulas to solve specific statistics problems. This book gives practice in using Excel in two different ways: (1) writing formulas (e.g., confidence interval about the mean, one-group t-test, two-group t-test, correlation) and (2) using Excel\u2019s drop-down formula menus (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple correlations and multiple regression, and one-way ANOVA). Three practice problems are provided at the end of each chapter, along with their solutions in an Appendix. An additional Practice Test allows readers to test their understanding of each chapter by attempting to solve a specific statistics problem using Excel; the solution to each of these problems is also given in an Appendix. This book is a tool that can be used either by itself or along with any good statistics book. Includes 166 illustrations in color Suitable for high school and undergraduate students Thomas J. Quirk is Professor of Marketing in the George Herbert Walker School of Business & Technology at Webster University based in St. Louis, Missouri (USA) where he teaches Marketing Statistics, Marketing Research, and Pricing Strategies. Professor Quirk has published over 30 statistics book with Springer, covering fourteen subject areas (business, education, psychology, social science, biological and life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, human resources management, health services management, environmental sciences, marketing, social work and advertising) using four versions of Excel (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016). He has published over 20 articles in professional journals, and presented more than 20 papers at professional conferences. Quirk holds a BS in Mathematics from John Carroll University, both an MA in Education and a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from Stanford University, and an MBA from the University of Missouri-St. Louis"

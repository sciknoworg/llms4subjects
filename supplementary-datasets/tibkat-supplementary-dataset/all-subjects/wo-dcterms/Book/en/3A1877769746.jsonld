            "abstract": "Fast, non-destructive detection technology and equipment for food quality and safety is a powerful technical support tool to ensure the development of food industry informatization and intelligence, with the advantages of fast speed, convenient operation, and easy online inspection. During the past two decades, such technologies have found numerous successful applications for food and agricultural product detection and processing. Owing to improvements in the manufacturing of photoelectric sensor pieces and progress in artificial intelligence and software algorithms, fast non-destructive detection technologies are able to provide more accurate, reliable, and stable solutions for food quality and safety detection and processing. They are closely integrated with the Internet of Things and intelligent manufacturing, promoting a new wave of innovation in intelligent manufacturing in the food industry. The application of new sensing technology and equipment in the fast, non-destructive detection of food has always been at the forefront of scientific and technological research. This Special Issue aims to focus on the latest research progress of this application and jointly discuss the focus of development of this research direction",

            "abstract": "\"This comprehensive book, which provides a succinct-as-possible glossary of the plethora of terms commonly used in communications, is destined to become an indispensable desk-side reference for engineers and others working in the area.\" - Curtis Siller, Lucent Technologies Are you sometimes overwhelmed by the overabundance of jargon encountered in technical books and articles? Hargrave's Communications Dictionary is a treasure of simplified communications terms, definitions, acronyms, charts, equations, and a wealth of related information amassed over the author's extensive engineering career. From ATM to Zone Paging, this volume includes over ten thousand definitions of key phrases that readers in industry, government, and academia need to understand. Many definitions incorporate basic tools for problem solving not found in other publications-such as drawings, graphs, charts, and references to IEEE standards. Real-world examples associated with voice and data communications are also included, as well as terminology from peripheral disciplines, including optics, computer science, data networks, and the Internet. Hargrave's Communications Dictionary is a fundamental resource for basic to intermediate-level students and practitioners, and is an essential quick reference for more experienced electronic technicians and engineers. This comprehensive dictionary is also an invaluable text for technical schools and universities. About the Author Frank Hargrave has more than 30 years experience in engineering and manufacturing at several major companies, including Multitech, Inc., ITT, and Yale Security, Inc. He is published in a variety of topics, including active filter design, residential telemetry systems, thermal compensation methods in electronic circuits, and telephone line interface methods. Mr. Hargrave currently runs his own consulting business in Charlotte, NC, where he also teaches classes at the Electronic Computer & Programming Institute. He has been issued 12 U.S. patents and has several others disclosed and in process",

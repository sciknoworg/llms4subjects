                "Complex illumination and meteorological conditions can significantly limit the robustness of robotic vision systems. This book focuses on image pre-processing for robot vision in complex illumination and dynamic weather conditions. It systematically covers cutting-edge models and algorithms, approaching them from a novel viewpoint based on studying the atmospheric physics and imaging mechanism. It provides valuable insights and practical methods such as illumination calculations, scattering modeling, shadow/highlight detection and removal, intrinsic image derivation, and rain/snow/fog removal technologies that will enable robots to be effective in diverse lighting and weather conditions, i.e., ensure their all-weather operating capacity. As such, the book offers a valuable resource for researchers, graduate students and engineers in the fields of robot engineering and computer science. ."

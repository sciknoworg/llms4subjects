They like to read. They take satisfaction from their work. They are resolutely kind. And they realize that none of this is considered . . . normal.   Leonard and Hungry Paul is the story of two friends struggling to protect their understanding of what's meaningful in life. It is about the uncelebrated people of this world -- the gentle, the meek, the humble. And as they struggle to persevere, the book asks a surprisingly enthralling question: Is it really them against the world, or are they on to something?\" --",

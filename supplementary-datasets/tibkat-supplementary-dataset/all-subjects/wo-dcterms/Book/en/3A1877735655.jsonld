            "abstract": "The transformation of public social welfare and healthcare services faces enormous challenges including economic pressures, healthcare debt, growing demand due to aging populations, and skilled workforce shortages. Consequently, mere reactive measures are inadequate, and a profound systemic change is essential. An ecosystem-based approach integrates knowledge and resources, creating value for all stakeholders and society.   The complex challenges in social welfare and healthcare demand transdisciplinary and cross-sectoral co-creation. Gathering and interpreting knowledge collaboratively among public, private, and third sectors, as well as educational institutions and universities, is crucial. Public services are evolving into co-creation and multiple provider models, forming multifaceted ecosystems.   This edited volume explores the definitions of an innovation ecosystem as well as operational models, and goal setting. It addresses what ecosystem development means in social welfare and healthcare reform and how innovation ecosystems can function optimally. The articles also discuss challenges in ecosystem-based activities.   The book outlines research phenomena and methods in ecosystem development, considering interconnectedness and complexity of societal issues, as well as the impacts of solutions and the specificity of contexts",

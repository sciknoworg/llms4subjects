            "abstract": "\"This volume, Nanomechanics and Micromechanics: Generalized Models and Nonclassical Engineering Approaches, enables readers to interpret and predict the effective mechanical properties of existing and emerging composites through modeling and design. The book addresses that materials and structures with small-scale dimensions do not behave in the same manner as their bulk counterparts. Once materials dimensions are reduced to the micron- and-sub-micron range, their properties are subject to significant change. Thus, mechanical properties will be varied and will depend on the sample size. In the meantime, due to the large surface-to-volume ration of small structures, deformation mechanisms are subject to change. This volume integrates various approaches in micromechanics and nanomechanics into a unified mathematical framework, complete with coverage of both linear and nonlinear behaviors. It weaves together the basic concepts, mathematical fundamentals, and formulations of micromechanics and nanomechanics into a systemic approach for understanding and modeling the effective material behavior of composite materials. While providing information on recent developments in the mathematical framework of micro- and nanomechanics, the volume addresses highly localized phenomena and a number of interesting applications. It also illustrates application of micromechanical and nanomechanical theory to design novel engineering materials. This volume is intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, and engineers interested and involved in mechanical analysis and design. Key features: Covers some recent applications and impact areas of micromechanics and nanomechanics that have not been discussed in traditional micromechanics and nanomechanics books Reviews the fundamentals for micro- and nanomechanics Describes nano and microstructure characterization Presents case studies and research methodology on nanomechanics and micromechanics Studies mathematical models and failure criteria Introduces a straightforward approach on derivation of mechanical/mathematical results with emphasis on issues of practical importance\"--",

            "abstract": "This volume considers the Prabodhacandrodaya N\u0101\u1e6daka (c. 1760 CE), an allegorical drama composed by Brajv\u0101s\u012bd\u0101s in Brajbh\u0101\u1e63\u0101. It contributes to the study of vernacular n\u0101\u1e6dakas with its first complete English translation. Moreover, the critical analysis shows that the foundational Sanskrit texts for Ved\u0101nta and those for Bhakti play a part in the Prabodhacandrodaya N\u0101\u1e6daka\u2019s philosophical and religious edifice. At the same time, the investigation demonstrates that Brajv\u0101s\u012bd\u0101s expresses several philosophical ideas by adaptively reusing the R\u0101mcaritm\u0101nas by Tuls\u012bd\u0101s (c. 1574 CE). Brajv\u0101s\u012bd\u0101s composes a doh\u0101 by combining one line of his invention with a line from the M\u0101nas. This method is employed throughout all the personified metaphysical concepts. That Brajv\u0101s\u012b not only read Bhakti but also Ved\u0101nta through the R\u0101mcaritm\u0101nas highlights the philosophical and literary creativity in 18th c. North India. It points to the necessity to rethink the sources of Ved\u0101nta philosophies, by including works non-conventional for language and genre, because not in Sanskrit and not \u015b\u0101stras. Such sources may not be original in their contribution per se but are essential to understand how early modern philosophy was done, conceived and transmitted. ; This volume considers the Prabodhacandrodaya N\u0101\u1e6daka (c. 1760 CE), an allegorical drama composed by Brajv\u0101s\u012bd\u0101s in Brajbh\u0101\u1e63\u0101.

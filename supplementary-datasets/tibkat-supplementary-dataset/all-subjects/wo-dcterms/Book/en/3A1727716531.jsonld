                "The fifth edition of the Essential of Food Science text continues its approach of presenting the essential information of food chemistry, food technology, and food preparations while providing a single source of information for the non-major food science student. This latest edition includes new discussions of food quality and new presentations of information around biotechnology and genetically modified foods. Also new in this edition is a discussion of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), a comparison chart for Halal and Kosher foods and introductions to newly popular products like pea starchand the various plant-based meat analogues that are now available commercially and for household use. Each chapter ends with a glossary of terms, references, and a bibliography. The popular \"Culinary Alert!\" features are scattered throughout the text and provide suggestions for the reader to easily apply the information in the text to his or her cooking application."

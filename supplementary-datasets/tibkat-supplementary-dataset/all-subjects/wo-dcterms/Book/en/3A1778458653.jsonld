            "abstract": "Advances in the knowledge of the tangible components (position, size, shape) and intangible components (identity, habits) of an historic building or site involves fundamental and complex tasks in any project related to the conservation of cultural heritage (CH). In recent years, new geotechnologies have proven their usefulness and added value to the field of cultural heritage (CH) in the tasks of recording, modeling, conserving, and visualizing. In addition, current developments in building information modeling (HBIM), allow integration and simulation of different sources of information, generating a digital twin of any complex CH construction. As a result, experts in the area have increased the number of available sensors and methodologies. However, the quick evolution of geospatial technologies makes it necessary to revise their use, integration, and application in CH. This process is difficult to adopt, due to the new options which are opened for the study, analysis, management, and valorization of CH. Therefore, the aim of the present Special Issue is to cover the latest relevant topics, trends, and best practices in geospatial technologies and processing methodologies for CH sites and scenarios as well as to introduce the new tendencies. This book originates from the Special Issue \u201cData Acquisition and Processing in Cultural Heritage\u201d, focusing primarily on data and sensor integration for CH; documentation/restoration in CH; heritage 3D documentation and modeling of complex CH sites; drone inspections in CH; software development in CH; and augmented reality in CH. It is hoped that this book will provide the advice and guidance required for any CH professional, making the best possible use of these sensors and methods in CH",

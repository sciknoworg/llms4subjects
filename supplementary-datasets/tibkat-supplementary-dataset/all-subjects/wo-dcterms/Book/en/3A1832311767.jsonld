            "abstract": "The volume aims at offering an overview of the studies on the fl\u00e2neur. It consists of three parts and an appendix. The first part defines the figure of the fl\u00e2neur. In particular, the fl\u00e2neur's characteristics are first analysed with respect to a series of oxymorons, to then be declined in relation to some themes, namely: the fl\u00e2neur's slowness as a combined expression of body and mind, the moods of living one's condition, the birth of the fl\u00e2neuse, the relationship between the fl\u00e2neur and other figures at opposite ends of the social ladder, the love and hate between the fl\u00e2neur and tourists, the constraints imposed on the fl\u00e2neur in the society of control and, finally, fl\u00e2nerie as a lifestyle. In the second part, the focus shifts to urban places as privileged contexts of action and reflection for the fl\u00e2neur. In particular, the discussed topics are the \"genius loci\", the possibility of analysing places through the forms of reverie which undermine the recurrent images marked by accredited methodologies, and finally the inevitably individual in-depth study paths leading to fl\u00e2nerie, which require a more direct contribution than the one given by subjects who practice it. Specific attention is paid to fl\u00e2nerie as the inspection carried out by architects and urban planners, with the additional aim of designing the urban territory for the involvement of the entire community. The third part is dedicated to an illustration of the various ways a fl\u00e2nerie can be achieved. Various types of fl\u00e2nerie are identified and described: from the free itinerant one, to the shadowing and the observation from a fixed place. In this part, there are also some reflections regarding the relationship between fl\u00e2neur, houses and objects, as well as some final considerations on the development prospects of research on the fl\u00e2neur himself. Finally, in the appendix, there is a discussion on the protocol in use to create some fl\u00e2neries with students from different departments and from different Italian universities, followed by some concrete examples of fl\u00e2nerie in compliance with the definition given in the third part",

            "abstract": "\"Elgar Advanced Introductions are stimulating and thoughtful introductions to major fields in the social sciences, business and law, expertly written by the world's leading scholars. Designed to be accessible yet rigorous, they offer concise and lucid surveys of the substantive and policy issues associated with discrete subject areas. Leading mobilities theorist Mimi Sheller offers an up-to-date, comprehensive analysis of the complex mobility disruptions of the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath in this timely Advanced Introduction. It outlines the formation of the interdisciplinary field of mobility studies, arguing that mobilities theory is crucial to planning post-pandemic recovery, sustainable communities, and low-carbon transitions. From tourism to migration to urban infrastructure, to informal and reproductive mobilities, Sheller reveals how multiple im/mobilities are interconnected, as the novel coronavirus reminds us as it hitchhikes across the globe through its human hosts. Key features: Centres mobility justice as a key topic throughout, revealing the vast inequities in im/mobilities, structured by gender, race and nationality Challenges existing approaches to social science, calling for the extension of critical mobility studies to address complex contemporary challenges Offers up-to-date analysis of key policy programs such as the Green New Deal, and a comparative analysis of differing visions of alternative mobilities futures. This innovative Advanced Introduction will be a beneficial read for students and scholars of mobilities research, tourism studies, migration studies, human geography, urban studies and sustainability\"--",

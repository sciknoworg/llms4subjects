                "This volume combines well-established state-of-the-art techniques and innovative technologies in the field of emotions and applying them to food and sensory sciences. Chapter guide readers through explicit measures of emotions, protocols enabling the measure of implicit aspects of emotions, and protocols enabling analysis of complex and voluminous data generated by emotion studies in food science. Authoritative and cutting-edge, Basic Protocols on Emotions, Senses, and Foods aims to provide researchers the most complete information possible in terms of stimuli, materials, and methods for characterizing emotions, in order to give them the possibility of taking on new projects and new challenges in food science.",

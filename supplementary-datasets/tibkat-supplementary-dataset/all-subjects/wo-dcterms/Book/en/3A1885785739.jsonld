            "abstract": "Pandemics are disruptive events that have profound consequences for society and the economy. This volume aims to present an analysis of the economic impact of COVID-19 and its likely consequences for our future. This is achieved by drawing from the expertise of authors who specialise in a wide range of fields including fiscal and monetary policy, banking, financial markets, pensions and insurance, artificial intelligence and big data, climate change, labour market, travel, tourism and politics, among others. We asked contributing authors to write their chapters for a non-technical audience so that their message could reach beyond academia and professional economists to policy makers and the wider society. The material in this volume draws from the latest research and provides a wealth of ideas for further investigations and opportunities for reflection. This also makes it an ideal learning tool for economics and finance students wishing to gain a deeper understanding of how COVID-19 could influence their disciplines",

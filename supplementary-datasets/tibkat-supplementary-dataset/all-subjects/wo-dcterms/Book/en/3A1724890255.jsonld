            "abstract": "The primary purpose of this study was to profile residents and living conditions in novostroiki, or the rapidly growing areas of new self-built construction ringing Bishkek where more than one fourth of city residents now live, in order to identify the major problems and areas for potential future Bank and donor engagement. The study findings are based on analysis of results from a survey of 493 households in nine novostroiki established from 1989-1991, as well as focus group findings, a study of the institutional framework, and a study of sanitation. In interpreting the survey results, it is important to keep in mind that households in more recently established novostroiki face more difficulties than older novostroiki where residents have had more time to address their problems. The major findings are: Novostroiki are a large and growing problem for Bishkek: novostroiki growth has resumed in recent years and is unlikely to stop; Novostroiki residents are more diverse than most people think. Incomes and living conditions vary greatly among novostroiki, as do access to, and quality of, basic infrastructure, health and educational establishments. Primarily rural migrants, novostroiki residents build their own houses with the help of the community (ashar); and better off novostroiki residents live in superior houses and have access to more services",

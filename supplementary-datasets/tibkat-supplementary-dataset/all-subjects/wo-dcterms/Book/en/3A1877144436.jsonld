                "Chapter 1: Introduction -- Chapter 2: Radio, women and politics -- Chapter 3: Radio, women and finances -- Chapter 4: Radio, women and life within marriage -- Chapter 5: Radio, women and inheritance -- Chapter 6: \u2018We\u2019re more than just a radio\u2019: Radio Scout and its Women\u2019s Listening Associations -- Chapter 7: Radio, women IDPs and women journalists -- Chapter 8: Conclusion.",
                "This open access book breaks new ground by examining the significant role played by radio in empowering women in three Francophone West African countries: Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. It examines the representation and perception of key themes broadcast by radio and associated with women\u2019s empowerment in the three countries. Each chapter contextualises a specific topic in the country and then explores discrete aspects of radio\u2019s provision. The topics covered in the chapters are women\u2019s political engagement; women and finances; women and life within marriage; inheritance; women\u2019s involvement in radio structures; and radio, internally displaced women, and trauma. Given the social, economic and political vulnerability and deteriorating security situation of the three countries, this book provides a timely and meaningful contribution to acknowledging and understanding the vital role of radio in women\u2019s empowerment. Emma Heywood is a Senior Lecturer in Journalism, Radio and Communication at the University of Sheffield. Her research focuses on the role and impact of radio in conflict-affected areas, particularly regarding perceptions and representations of women\u2019s rights and empowerment in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso."

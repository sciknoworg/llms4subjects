            "abstract": "\"Currently, studies on microbiomes have been expanded to a wide range, generating numerous data and novel insights about microbiomes. Microbiome exchanges occur most frequently in human bodies, animals, plants, and environments, and encounters cannot be counted as they occur. The visible signs and implications in gut-micro habitat are extremely diverse, indicating that microorganisms are highly exchangeable or transferable, or that they may be endangered entities. Hence, in many ways, the microbiomes and viromes are related to health and disease and are involved in major activities of the body or environment. This unseen majority and dominance create numerous medical and non-medical complications or are involved in various cycles in the bodies of organisms and the environment. Similarly, they form biofilm in some cases, which has a huge impact on disease and non-disease conditions, especially in the case of humans. As a result, this book presents recent research and updates on the microbial ecology of microbiomes, biofilms, and viromes associated with all organisms, as well as all modes of transfer from the environment to organisms and vice versa\"--",

            "abstract": "This book presents some current work by leading researchers in the newly emerging branch of fluid mechanics devoted to the study of lubricated transport of viscous materials. It is a field that has attracted researchers both in academia and industry because of its widespread applications. The major topics covered here include core-annular flows, paraffin deposition in pipelines, transportation of capsules, shear-induced migration of particles and contact lines. An overview is presented at the beginning. Lubricated transport of viscous materials has been a major focus of research in recent times because of its obvious industrial applications. There are four main types of lubricated flows - solids by liquids, liquids by other liquids, slurries with water and turbulent gas with water. To the best of our knowledge, this book, which resulted from an IUTAM Symposium held in Tobago in 1997, represents the first attempt to document current work done on problems associated with these various types of lubricated flows. There are contributions by some of the leading experts in the field who have close links with industry. This book will be of interest to researchers in the field from both academia and industry, as well as petroleum engineers and graduate petroleum engineering students",

            "abstract": "\"Master planning and scheduling involves many functions of business and crosses most departmental lines. This is the first and only book designed to pull together a comprehensive body of knowledge about master planning and scheduling and to discuss the MPS process within the context of various manufacturing environments. It not only paints a broad perspective across the whole canvas of service and manufacturing operations but provides the fine details needed to understand MPS in specific types of businesses. Whether you make finished goods to stock, manufacturer or assemble or finish to customer order, package/re-package or kit to customer specification/order, or design and build products to customer specifications, you will find information and tools relevant to your business. Chapters 1 through 6 of Master Planning and Scheduling: An Essential Guide to Competitive Manufacturing define the master planning and scheduling process by explaining why and what to master plan and/or master schedule, the basic terminology, calculations, formats, mechanics, and how to manage change using master planning and scheduling. Chapters 7 through 12 cover specific tools and techniques used in various manufacturing environments (make-to-stock, make-to-order, design-to-order, engineer-to-order, make-to-contract, finish-to-order, kit-to-order, package-to-order). Chapter 13 is devoted to data integrity requirements in order to support an effective and efficient master planning and scheduling process. Chapters 14 through 17 describe process supporting functions of MPS, such as integrated business planning, resource requirements planning/rough cut capacity planning, supply management, and demand management. The book's chapters conclude with chapters 18 through 20 that provide guidelines for implementing and operating successful master planning and scheduling processes across the supply chain and entire enterprise.\"--",

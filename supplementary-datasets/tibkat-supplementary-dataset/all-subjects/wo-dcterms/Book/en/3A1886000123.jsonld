            "abstract": "\"In the recent years, a wide variety of new chemicals continue to be developed as a result of industrial development and associated anthropogenic activities. The microbial contaminants in the environment, more precisely, antibiotic-resistant genes/bacteria produced as a result of mutation due to antibacterial drugs, are also considered emerging contaminants and specifically called emerging microbial contaminants such as sapoviruses, Waddlia chondrophila and Streptococcus parauberis. Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care products are a diverse group of compounds that includes ibuprofen, diclofenac, triclosan, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, steroidal hormones, and active ingredients in soaps, detergents and perfumes which could find their way into food materials are tagged emerging contaminants. Given this, Emerging Contaminants in Food and Food Products discusses issues around the emerging contaminants in food and food products. Different types of contaminants, such as biological, chemical, organic, inorganic and microbial contaminants in foods, ways of detecting them and regulations surrounding global food safety are all covered\"--",

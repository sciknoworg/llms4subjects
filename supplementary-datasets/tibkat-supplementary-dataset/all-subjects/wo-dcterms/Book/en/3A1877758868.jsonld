            "abstract": "Scandinavian children and adolescents\u2019 media consumption has changed dramatically in the past decade. Films, series, and social media content on global platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube are now a major part of young people\u2019s media diet, while encounters with domestic films, series, and platforms are in decline, severely challenging the ways domestic players think about young audiences. The contributions in this book explore these recent developments in the production, distribution, as well as reception of fictional content for children and adolescent audiences in the thoroughly digitalised and transnationalised Scandinavian countries.     Using qualitative and quantitative methods, such as interviews, case studies, textual analyses, and surveys, the contributors present recent studies on how commissioners and producers develop children\u2019s content in the highly competitive, professionalised, and digitalised media environment, and on how children think about Scandinavian vis-\u00e0-vis global content. Collectively, the book offers readers new knowledge on how Scandinavian media distributors, producers, and creatives \u2013 and their young audiences \u2013 act in the face of this new reality. This book is relevant for scholars, students, and industry professionals with an interest in children and adolescents, culture, and media",

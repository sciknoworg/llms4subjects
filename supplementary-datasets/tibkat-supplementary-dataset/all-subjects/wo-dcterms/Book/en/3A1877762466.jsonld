            "abstract": "The book ''Applied Studies of Coastal and Marine Environments'' is a collection of a number of high-quality and comprehensive work on coastal and marine environment. This book has an Introductory Chapter, followed by 15 chapters. Chapters 2 and 3 are devoted to coastal geological sedimentation and its impacts on marine environment. Consequently, Chapter 4 investigates neo-tectonic movement in the Pearl River Delta. Different aspects of the coastal pollution and its impacts are addressed in Chapter 5 through Chapter 13. Furthermore, coastal management is also discussed in Chapter 14, and monitoring the coastal environment using remote sensing and GIS techniques is reported in Chapter 15. Finally, Chapter 16 addresses the human history of maritime exploitation and adaptation process to coastal and marine environments. It is important to investigate the history of maritime exploitation and adaptation to environment coastal zone to learn how to explore the oceans",

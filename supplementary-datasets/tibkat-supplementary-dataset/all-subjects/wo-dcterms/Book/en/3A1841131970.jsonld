            "title": "Everyday Life in the Culture of Surveillance",
            "abstract": "Over the recent decades, the possibilities to surveil people have increased and been refined with the ongoing digital transformation of society. Surveillance can now go in any direction, and various forms of online surveillance saturate most people\u2019s lives, which are increasingly lived in digital environments. To understand this situation and nuance the contemporary discussions about surveillance \u2013 not least in the highly digitalised context of the Nordic countries \u2013 we must adopt cultural and ethical perspectives in studying people\u2019s attitudes, motives, and behaviours. The \u201cculture of surveillance\u201d, to borrow David Lyon\u2019s term, is a culture where questions about privacy and publicness, and rights and benefits, are once again brought to the fore.  This anthology takes up this challenge, with contributions from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical frameworks that discuss and shed light on the complexity of contemporary surveillance and thus problematise power relations between the many actors involved in the development and performance of surveillance culture. The contributions highlight how more and more actors and practices play a part in our increasingly digitalised society.  The book is an outcome of the research project \u201ciAccept: Soft surveillance \u2013 between acceptance and resistance\u201d, financed by the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation. The anthology\u2019s editors are project members, all based at Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden: Lars Samuelsson, associate professor of philosophy; Copp\u00e9lie Cocq, professor of S\u00e1mi studies and digital humanities; Stefan Gelfgren, associate professor of sociology of religion; and Jesper Enbom, associate professor of media studies",

A timely volume full of original research, the book explores women\u2019s complex negotiations of their agency over both their labour and public representation, and their use of personal and professional networks to sustain their careers. Including a series of case studies that explore a range of well-known and lesser-known women working in theatre, film and popular performance of the period. The volume is divided into two connected parts. \u2018Female theatre workers in the social and theatrical realm\u2019 looks at the relationship between women\u2019s work \u2013 on- and offstage \u2013 and autobiography, activism, technique, touring, education and the law. Part II, \u2018Women and popular performance\u2019, focuses on the careers of individual artists, once household names, including Lily Brayton, Ellen Terry, radio star Mabel Constanduros, and Oscar-winning film star Margaret Rutherford. Overall, the book provides new and vibrant cultural histories of women\u2019s work in the theatre and performance industries of the period",

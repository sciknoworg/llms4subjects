            "title": "Middleware Solutions for Wireless Internet of Things",
            "abstract": "The proliferation of powerful but cheap devices, together with the availability of a plethora of wireless technologies, has pushed for the spread of the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT), which is typically much more heterogeneous, dynamic, and general-purpose if compared with the traditional IoT. The WIoT is characterized by the dynamic interaction of traditional infrastructure-side devices, e.g., sensors and actuators, provided by municipalities in Smart City infrastructures, and other portable and more opportunistic ones, such as mobile smartphones, opportunistically integrated to dynamically extend and enhance the WIoT environment. A key enabler of this vision is the advancement of software and middleware technologies in various mobile-related sectors, ranging from the effective synergic management of wireless communications to mobility/adaptivity support in operating systems and differentiated integration and management of devices with heterogeneous capabilities in middleware, from horizontal support to crowdsourcing in different application domains to dynamic offloading to cloud resources, only to mention a few. The book presents state-of-the-art contributions in the articulated WIoT area by providing novel insights about the development and adoption of middleware solutions to enable the WIoT vision in a wide spectrum of heterogeneous scenarios, ranging from industrial environments to educational devices. The presented solutions provide readers with differentiated point of views, by demonstrating how the WIoT vision can be applied to several aspects of our daily life in a pervasive manner",

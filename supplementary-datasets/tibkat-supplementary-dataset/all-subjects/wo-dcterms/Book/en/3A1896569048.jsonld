                "This book is the second edition of the one originally published in 2017. The original publication features the discovery of numerous novel applications for the use of smartphones and portable media devices for the quantification of gait, reflex response, and an assortment of other concepts that constitute first-in-the-world applications for these devices. Since the first edition, numerous evolutions involving the domain of wearable and wireless systems for healthcare have transpired warranting the publication of the second edition. This volume covers wearable and wireless systems for healthcare that are far more oriented to the unique requirements of the biomedical domain. The paradigm-shifting new wearables have been successfully applied to gait analysis, homebound therapy, and quantifiable exercise. Additionally, the confluence of wearable and wireless systems for healthcare with deep learning and neuromorphic applications for classification is addressed. The authors expect that these significant developments make this book valuable for all readers."

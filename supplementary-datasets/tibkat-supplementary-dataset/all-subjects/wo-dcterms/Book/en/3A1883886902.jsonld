            "abstract": "This resource covers basic concepts and modeling examples for the three \u2070\u0301\u208bpillars\u2070\u0301\u208a of EW: Electronic Attack (EA) systems, Electronic Protection (EP) techniques, and Electronic Support (ES). It develops techniques for the modeling and simulation (M&S) of modern radar and electronic warfare (EW) systems and reviews radar principles, including the radar equation. M&S techniques are introduced, and example models developed in MATLAB and Simulink are presented and discussed in detail. These individual models are combined to create a full end-to-end engineering engagement simulation between a pulse-Doppler radar and a target. The radar-target engagement model is extended to include jamming models and is used to illustrate the interaction between radar and jamming signals and the impact on radar detection and tracking. In addition, several classic EA techniques are introduced and modeled, and the effects on radar performance are explored. This book is a valuable resource for engineers, scientists, and managers who are involved in the design, development, or testing of radar and EW systems. It provides a comprehensive overview of the M&S techniques that are used in these systems, and the book's many examples and case studies provide a solid foundation for understanding how these techniques can be applied in practice",

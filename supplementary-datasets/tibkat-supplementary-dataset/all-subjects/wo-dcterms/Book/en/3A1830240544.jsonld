            "abstract": "Investing in better data systems is critical to maximize the impact of social protection programs as more and more countries around the world are aiming to not only reduce poverty and inequality but also to achieve Universal Social Protection (USP). Globally the expansion of social safety net programs has contributed to poverty reduction and the improved well-being of the poor. Now countries are now offering more comprehensive packages of social benefits and services to serve broader population needs and to facilitate more sustainable poverty reduction outcomes. If not managed well, the expansion of services and beneficiaries can contribute to fragmentation in program processes and systems that will result in higher administrative costs, lack of coordination, and duplication in processes. Frequent climate shocks and the COVID-19 pandemic have also further highlighted critical gaps in social protection coverage, exposing the need for more and better data systems to identify and support those still excluded from social protection programs and systems. A high-quality data system is especially important to direct appropriate benefits and services to the groups that need them. Although there is no one size fits all targeting strategy, building a credible social information system (SIS) and improving social protection delivery systems (DS) are key to achieving USP everywhere. In the Indonesian context, the greatest gains are more likely to come from investment in coverage and quality of the data through better systems and expertise. This policy note summarizes options and principles for improving data quality for an effective social registry in Indonesia, to better support outreach, intake, registration and eligibility determination for Social Protection Programs. While the note is Indonesia-focused, it provides lessons applicable to other countries addressing these challenges as well",

                "Interest group scholarship has so far focused mainly on national politics and has had very little to say about interest groups in American cities, counties, school districts, and special districts. Initially published as a special issue in Interest Groups & Advocacy, this volume is a step toward remedying that by examining some of the interest groups that are commonly active in US local politics. The contributions herein discuss real estate developers, tenant organizations, teachers' unions, police unions, and local PACs\u2014covering topics such as how they are organized, how they engage in local politics, some of the constraints on their influence, and the nuanced ways in which ideology and identities can sometimes shape what coalitions are possible in the local context. By bringing this work together in one place, in a volume devoted to research on interest groups, the hope is that this book will help to cement \u201cinterest groups in local politics\u201d as the recognizable research focus it deserves to be. Sarah Anzia is Associate Professor of Public Policy & Political Science at University of California Berkeley, USA.",

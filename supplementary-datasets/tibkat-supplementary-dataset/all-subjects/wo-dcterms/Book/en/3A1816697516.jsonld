            "title": "Realizing Sustainability Through Diversity : The Case for Gender Diversity Among Sri Lanka's Business Leadership",
            "abstract": "This report makes the case for greater gender diversity on Sri Lanka's corporate boards and in senior management by highlighting the value propositions of such diversity for companies, communities, and ultimately the country. Diversity is about more than just gender, ethnicity, or religion. However, this report focuses primarily on promoting gender diversity in the workplace, particularly in the corporate boardroom and among senior management. Empirical evidence from around the world shows the importance and value of gender diversity in improving firms' overall performance, including but not limited to financial performance. Gender diversity among business leaders typically leads to better decision-making processes and better monitoring and strategy involvement. The business case for gender balance at the top goes beyond financial performance. Extensive research shows that having more women in business leadership positions leads to higher environmental, social, and governance standards, with a particularly clear connection when women achieve a critical mass of about 30 percent on company boards. Companies with enhanced environmental, social, and governance standards also perform better on critical metrics: stronger internal controls and management oversight, reduced risk of fraud or other ethical violations, positive workplace environment, greater stakeholder engagement, and improved reputation and brand. Therefore, having a more gender-balanced board and leadership team contributes to stronger environmental, social, and governance performance, which, in turn, leads to better business performance. Ultimately, diversity is about ensuring companies' competitiveness, performance, and long-term sustainability",

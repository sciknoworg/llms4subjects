            "abstract": "Knowledge about the brain is argued by many to have the potential to yield powerful insights for ourselves and societies. This chapter will examine how neuroscience is framed by, and can be impactful within, a range of social domains. Central to this is the construction of neuroscientific knowledge as novel and of quintessential import. Through the analysis, I will demonstrate how the brain is (sometimes) rendered as significant, and with what effects. At the same time, I also reflect on some of the limits to this; for example, professional ambivalence and chagrin about how neuroscientific notions circulate within their field of practice. Hence, the chapter makes plain the perceived import of neuroscience for a variety of personal and professional projects, while also suggesting how both celebrants and critics of neuroscience can sometimes overstate its traction within research, policy, and everyday life",

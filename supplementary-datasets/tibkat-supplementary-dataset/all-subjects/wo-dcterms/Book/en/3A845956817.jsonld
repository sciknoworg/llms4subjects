            "abstract": "KEY ISSUES Economic outlook: The Canadian economy has expanded at a solid pace since 2013, but rebalancing of growth away from household consumption and residential investment remains  incomplete, owing mainly to weak business investment. Growth momentum is expected to continue  alongside a strengthening U.S. recovery despite substantially lower oil prices. Risks to the  outlook are modestly tilted to the downside given sluggish global growth, effects unfolding from  sharply lower oil prices, and housing market risks. Key domestic vulnerabilities in housing markets  and the household sector remain elevated but contained fro  m a financial  stability perspective. Policies for balanced and sustained recovery: An appropriate policy mix should help facilitate  rebalancing to generate a broader and more durable recovery, reduce domestic vulnerabilities, and  further strengthen financial system resilience: \ufffd Macro policies: Monetary policy can remain accommodative for now given that inflation  expectations are well-anchored, stronger business investment is still a missing link, risks to an  export-led recovery are to the downside, and housing markets are expected to cool as U.S. interest  rates rise and with lower oil prices. Fiscal consolidation should proceed in light of longer-term  challenges at the provincial level, but federal authorities should consider adopting a neutral  stance going forward, using available fiscal resources for targeted measures to support growth.  Structural policies to improve productivity in the economy would increasingly need to complement  this policy mix. \ufffd Housing sector and financial sector policies: Further macro-prudential policy action may be  needed to guard against risks to financial stability if household balance sheet vulnerabilities  resume rising. Reforms to limit government exposure to housing markets and encourage appropriate  risk retention by the private sector should continue. Improving complex coordination across federal  and provincial authorities in supervision and stress-testing of depository institutions and  strengthening macro-prudential and crisis management frameworks will reinforce the resilience of  Canada's financial system. Policy response to past advice: Since the 2013 Article IV Consultation mission, the authorities  have taken some further steps to limit taxpayer exposure to the housing sector and strengthen  mortgage insurance underwriting practices. Some work on FSAP recommendations has also  ...",

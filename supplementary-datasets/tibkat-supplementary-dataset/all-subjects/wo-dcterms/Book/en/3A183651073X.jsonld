            "abstract": "This open access book presents a structural model and an associated test instrument designed to provide a detailed analysis of professional competences for teaching mathematical modelling. The conceptualisation is based on the COACTIV model, which describes aspects, areas and facets of professional competences of teachers. The manual provides an overview of the essential teaching skills in application-related contexts and offers the tools needed to capture these aspects. It discusses the objectives and application areas of the instrument, as well as the development of the test. In addition, it describes the implementation and evaluates the quality and results of the structural equation analysis of the model. Teaching mathematical modelling is a cognitively challenging activity for (prospective) teachers. Thus, teacher education requires a detailed analysis of professional competence for teaching mathematical modelling. Measuring this competence requires theoretical models that accurately describe requirements placed upon teachers, as well as appropriate evaluation tools that adequately capture skills and abilities in this field. This book presents an instrument that measures the professional competences in a sample of 349 prospective teachers",

The articles published in this Special Issue are theoretical\u2013experimental and experimental, and also show the practical nature of the research. They are grouped by topic, and the main content of each article is briefly discussed for your convenience. These articles extend the knowledge in the field of non-destructive testing in civil engineering with regard to new and improved non-destructive testing (NDT) methods, their complementary application, and also the analysis of their results\u2014including the use of sophisticated mathematical algorithms and artificial intelligence, as well as the diagnostics of materials, components, structures, entire buildings, and interesting case studies",

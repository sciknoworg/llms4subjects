                "This volume discusses geological, biological and sustainability aspects of coastal, estuary and lake environments. It offers a comprehensive understanding of biotic, physico-chemical, sedimentological and socio-environmental factors associated with the sustainable development of these environments in areas vulnerable to climate change and other anthropogenic activities. The book is divided into several main sections, covering the geological and biological processes and dynamics of these environments, water quality and hydrological modeling, sediment characteristics, bio-indicators and ecological analysis, climate change impacts, geospatial applications, and sustainable development practices and scenarios. The book aims to be a useful resource for academics, scientists, coastal and marine practitioners, meteorologists, environmental consultants and computing experts working in the areas of earth and ocean sciences.",

            "title": "Fourier Transform - Materials Analysis",
            "abstract": "The field of material analysis has seen explosive growth during the past decades. Almost all the textbooks on materials analysis have a section devoted to the Fourier transform theory. For this reason, the book focuses on the material analysis based on Fourier transform theory. The book chapters are related to FTIR and the other methods used for analyzing different types of materials. It is hoped that this book will provide the background, reference and incentive to encourage further research and results in this area as well as provide tools for practical applications. It provides an applications-oriented approach to materials analysis written primarily for physicist, Chemists, Agriculturalists, Electrical Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Signal Processing Engineers, and the Academic Researchers and for the Graduate Students who will also find it useful as a reference for their research activities",

            "abstract": "Reception of Russian Literature of the Silver Age in China. In the late 20th century, there emerged a significant cultural fervor for the Russian literature of the Silver Age within Chinese academic circles, primarily focused on literary studies. This article examines the history of translating Russian literature of the Silver Age in China and its level of research development. It is revealed that, on one hand, the initial attempts at translating literary works of the Silver Age into Chinese began in the first half of the 20th century, with notable activity during the May Fourth Movement and towards the end of the 20th century. Consequently, works by well-known writers had more opportunities to be translated into Chinese and gain attention from the academic community, while many works by lesser-known authors remained overlooked. On the other hand, Chinese scholars\u2019 research on Russian literature of the Silver Age encompasses various literary genres such as poetry, novels, and dramas, with a focus on individual writers and their works. However, comprehensive and systematic studies in this field are still lacking. The examination of the history of translation and the level of research on Russian literature of the Silver Age in China contributes to academic progress, facilitates exchange and collaboration among scholars, provides reference materials and recommendations, and establishes a foundation for further in-depth research",

            "abstract": "Despite legal and social advances in the past two decades, sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)  people continue to face widespread discrimination and violence in many countries. This discrimination and  violence lead to exclusion, which adversely impacts their lives, as well as the communities and economies in which they live.   A major barrier to addressing this stigma and sexual orientation and gender identity-based exclusion is the lack of SOGI-specic data. Robust, quantitative data on differential development experiences and outcomes of sexual and gender minorities--especially those in developing countries--is extremely thin. This paucity of data jeopardizes the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and countries' commitment to the principle of 'leaving no one behind' in the effffort to end poverty and inequality.   'Equality of Opportunity for Sexual and Gender Minorities' assesses the unique challenges that sexual and gender  minorities face in six important areas:  (i) Criminalization and SOGI (ii) Access to education (iii) Access to the labor market  (iv) Access to public services and social protection  (v) Civil and political inclusion (vi) Protection from hate crimes.  This report covffers numerous policy recommendations to prevent and eliminate discriminatory practices in  all of the areas covered. It also seeks to influence legislative changes and support research on institutions and  regulations that can ultimately lead to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. At the same time, it acknowledges  that the mere existence of inclusive laws and regulations does not ensure that sexual and gender minorities  are free from discrimination--the enforcement of those laws is crucial.  This publication, the a first in a series of studies, will be expanded from the 16 countries included here to a wider  set of countries for more in-depth quantitative analysis and to identify possible correlations with socioeconomic  outcomes. It will seek to deepen knowledge, facilitate peer learning of good practices, and encourage reforms  to increase the inclusion of sexual and gender minorities",

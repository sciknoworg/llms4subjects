            "abstract": "Wikipedia\u2019s first twenty years: how what began as an experiment in collaboration became the world\u2019s most popular reference work.We have been looking things up in Wikipedia for twenty years. What began almost by accident\u2014a wiki attached to a nascent online encyclopedia\u2014has become the world\u2019s most popular reference work. Regarded at first as the scholarly equivalent of a Big Mac, Wikipedia is now known for its reliable sourcing and as a bastion of (mostly) reasoned interaction. How has Wikipedia, built on a model of radical collaboration, remained true to its original mission of \u201cfree access to the sum of all human knowledge\u201d when other tech phenomena have devolved into advertising platforms? In this book, scholars, activists, and volunteers reflect on Wikipedia\u2019s first twenty years, revealing connections across disciplines and borders, languages and data, the professional and personal.The contributors consider Wikipedia\u2019s history, the richness of the connections that underpin it, and its founding vision. Their essays look at, among other things, the shift from bewilderment to respect in press coverage of Wikipedia; Wikipedia as \u201cthe most important laboratory for social scientific and computing research in history\u201d; and the acknowledgment that \u201cfree access\u201d includes not just access to the material but freedom to contribute\u2014that the summation of all human knowledge is biased by who documents it.ContributorsPhoebe Ayers, Omer Benjakob, Yochai Benkler, William Beutler, Siko Bouterse, Rebecca Thorndike-Breeze, Amy Carleton, Robert Cummings, LiAnna L.

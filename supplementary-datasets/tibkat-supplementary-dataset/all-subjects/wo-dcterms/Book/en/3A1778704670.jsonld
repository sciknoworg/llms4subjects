            "abstract": "This book is a collection of the chapters intended to study only practical applications of HTS materials. You will find here a great number of research on actual applications of HTS as well as possible future applications of HTS. Depending on the strength of the applied magnetic field, applications of HTS may be divided in two groups: large scale applications (large magnetic fields) and small scale applications (small magnetic fields). 12 chapters in the book are fascinating studies about large scale applications as well as small scale applications of HTS. Some chapters are presenting interesting research on the synthesis of special materials that may be useful in practical applications of HTS. There are also research about properties of high-Tc superconductors and experimental research about HTS materials with potential applications. The future of practical applications of HTS materials is very exciting. I hope that this book will be useful in the research of new radical solutions for practical applications of HTS materials and that it will encourage further experimental research of HTS materials with potential technological applications",

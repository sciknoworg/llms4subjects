The study analyses readings by leading authors covering all aspects of modern economic education research - from building theoretical models of student learning, to evaluating the long-run impact of economic knowledge on individual behavior. Specific attention is given to the growing literature that evaluates the effectiveness of modern technology and alternative pedagogies on student learning of economics. Written by an expert in the field, this review serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers who are interested in conducting classroom research",

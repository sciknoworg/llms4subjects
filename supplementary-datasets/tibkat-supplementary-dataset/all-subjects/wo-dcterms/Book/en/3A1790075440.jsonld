                "The book brings together surveys and analyses that increase awareness of wooden buildings in terms of sustainability and the benefits offered by modern wood-based construction systems in terms of building efficiency. The volume\u2019s contribution to the understanding of efficient and sustainable wood-based constructions arises from the explanation of the authors\u2019 methodology for the evaluation of sustainability and efficiency within selected phases of the life cycle of buildings, a technique that can be used for the evaluation of different types of structural systems and their comparison from various perspectives. Analyzes various wood-based construction systems from a sustainability perspective; Presents a novel approach to assessing construction by means of building use; Explains a methodology of efficiency evaluation applicable to a range of different types of buildings."

                "\u201cThis timely text from political marketing experts brings together a plethora of up-and-coming and established authors to explore the most pertinent questions in political marketing today. Ethics, brand-branding for political movements, the role influencers play; are all covered. Read this fascinating book to understand more.\u201d ---Paul Baines, Professor of Political Marketing, University of Leicester, UK \"This is a must read for anyone interested in understanding the connection between politics and branding.\" ---Bruce I. Newman, Professor of Marketing, DePaul University, USA \"If you want the best research and thinking on International Political Branding then buy this book. The work is cutting edge, up to date, has quality thinking and has truly global reach with cases from America, Asia and Europe.\" ---Phil Harris, Professor Emeritus of Marketing & Public Affairs, University of Chester, UK Political uncertainty and instability characterise many regions around the world and, increasingly, can be observed in more established democracies. The COVID-19 pandemic, national and international tensions, and the proliferation of autocratic, chauvinist, and, at the most extreme, fascist forces around the world all contribute to turbulent political times. Such environments constitute tremendous challenges, but also opportunities for scholars to contribute to an understanding of processes in the political market, using the lens of political branding theories. Authors from various disciplinary backgrounds, including social psychology, marketing, and media and communications, provide commentaries and analyses of branding processes in different national contexts, all characterised by tensions and challenges. The topical and provocative content of the chapters, all focusing on recent political events and phenomena in the political arena, should appeal to researchers, branding practitioners, politicians, and members of the public seeking to deepen their understanding of current events and political branding concepts. Dr Mona Moufahim is Senior Lecturer at the Stirling Management School at the University of Stirling in Scotland, UK. She is the current Chair of the Political Marketing Special Interest Group of the Academy of Marketing. Her research focuses on identity, extreme right politics, and political marketing and consumption.",

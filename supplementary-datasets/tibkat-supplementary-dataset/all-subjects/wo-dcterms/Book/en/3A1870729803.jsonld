            "title": "Electrohydraulic servo systems : applications, design and control",
            "abstract": "This book covers the fundamental concepts of electrohydraulic (EH) servo systems in detail and also presents the developments about power, quadratic response, and control flexibility of EH servo systems with applications in aircraft/aerospace engineering, mobile equipment, material/structure testing, motion simulators, and strategic defense sectors. Various topics covered in this books are systems and configurations of servo systems, components, applications, design of SISO and MIMO and control options of SISO and MIMO systems. It further includes a chapter on contamination control, fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of these systems. The detailed working procedures and advice on implementation routines presented in this book will help readers to apply the control models and systems presented so as to make their own servo systems more efficient. The book will be useful for mechanical engineers and professionals involved in the analysis and design of electrohydraulic control systems, especially in advanced hydraulic industries, the aeronautical and space, and automotive industries. It would also be a useful reference for advanced courses in EH systems. .",

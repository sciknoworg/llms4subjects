                "This volume explores the latest integrated bioprocesses and technologies used to study the production of the target recombinant protein of therapeutic or diagnostic interest; its isolation, purification, and stabilization; and the bio-interaction and structural analyses. The chapters in this book are organized into four parts. Part One covers production methods of soluble and membrane proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, such as Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli. Part Two describes traditional and novel approaches for recombinant protein purification and stabilization, and buffers and additives. Part Three discusses automated methods in structural biology based on in silico approaches; and Part Four provides examples of advanced protein investigation methodologies to assess structural analysis such as high-throughput protein crystallization and time-resolved serial crystallography. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Cutting-edge and comprehensive, Advanced Methods in Structural Biology is a valuable resource to those in academia (i.e., graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) and researchers in the pharmaceutical industry who wish to learn more about this developing field. Chapter 5 is available open access under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License via link.springer.com.",

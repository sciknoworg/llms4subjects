            "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Things and Big Data, Cloud Computing has recently emerged as one of the latest buzzwords in the computing industry. It is the latest evolution of computing, where IT recourses are offered as services. Cloud computing provides on-demand, scalable, device-independent, and reliable services to its users. The exponential growth of digital data bundled with the needs of analysis, processing and storage, and cloud computing has paved the way for a cheap, secure, and omnipresent computing framework allowing for the delivery of enormous computing and storage capacity to a diverse community of end-recipients. Clouds are distributed technology platforms that leverage sophisticated technology innovations to provide highly scalable and resilient environments that can be remotely utilized by organizations in a multitude of powerful ways. The term cloud is often used as a metaphor for the Internet and can be defined as a new type of utility computing that basically uses servers that have been made available to third parties via the Internet",

                "This book is your definitive guide to the rapidly growing role of Quantitative User Experience (Quant UX) Research in product development. The book provides an overview of the skills you need on the job, presents hands-on projects with reusable code, and shares advice on starting and developing a career. The book goes beyond basic skills to focus on what is unique to Quant UX. The authors are two of the most widely recognized practitioners in Quant UX research, and this book shares insights from their combined decades of experience. Organizations today have more data about user needs and behaviors than ever before. With this large-scale data, Quant UX researchers work to understand usage patterns, measure the impact of design changes, and inform strategic decisions. In the Quant UX role, interdisciplinary researchers apply analytical skills to uncover user needs, inform engineering and design, answer strategic business questions, and optimize software and hardware products for human interaction. This book provides guidance around customer satisfaction surveys, understanding user behavior from log analysis, and the statistical methods that are commonly used to assess user outcomes. What You Will Learn Discover the role of Quantitative User Experience (Quant UX) research Understand how Quant UX research differs from other disciplines such as data science Plan common research projects and know how to achieve success Position Quant UX activities in product development, engineering, and UX organizations Apply the HEART framework to measure user experience outcomes Evaluate your skills and potential to be hired as a Quant UX researcher Know what to expect during job interviews Find examples of common Quant UX projects with shared R code and data sets."

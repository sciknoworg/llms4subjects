                "This book discusses the effect that artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) have on industry. The authors start by showing how the application of these technologies has already stretched across domains such as law, political science, policy, and economics and how it will soon permeate areas of autonomous transportation, education, and space exploration, only to name a few. The authors then discuss applications in a variety of industries. Throughout the volume, the authors provide detailed, well-illustrated treatments of each topic with abundant examples and exercises. This book provides relevant theoretical frameworks and the latest empirical research findings in various applications. The book is written for professionals who want to improve their understanding of the strategic role of trust at different levels of the information and knowledge society, that is, trust at the level of the global economy, of networks and organizations, of teams and work groups, of information systems and, finally, trust at the level of individuals as actors in the networked environments. Presents research in various industries and how artificial intelligence and Internet of Things is changing the landscape of business and management; Includes new and innovative features in artificial intelligence and IoT that can help in raising economic efficiency at both micro and macro levels; Examines case studies with tried and tested approaches to resolution of typical problems in each application of study."

                "This book explores both the history and current diplomatic and foreign policy challenges in Turkish-French relations. By critically analyzing Turkish and French government and archival documents, as well as other primary sources, it reviews the evolution of Turkish-French relations and offers a better understanding of various diplomatic issues, foreign policy decisions, and geopolitical questions. Furthermore, it sheds new light on the significance of domestic political demands for foreign policy decisions and the importance of mutual perceptions in shaping the two countries\u2019 relations. The book is divided into three parts, the first of which studies the history of Turkish-French relations, including the Ottoman Empire\u2019s trade relations with France, France\u2019s relations with the modern Republic of Turkey, and relations during the Cold War and its aftermath. The second part analyzes various dimensions, including diplomatic challenges, the two countries\u2019 foreign policy concepts, geopolitical aspects, economic and trade relations, and their cultural relationship. In turn, the third part presents case studies on more specific issues related to Franco-Turkish relations, including Turkey\u2019s EU accession process, the Armenian and Kurdish issues, and French and Turkish perspectives on the MENA region."

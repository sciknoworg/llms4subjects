            "abstract": "Intellectual Disability and Ireland, 1947\u20131996 explores the varied experiences of the intellectually disabled during the latter half of the mid-twentieth century in Ireland. Addressing the evolution of disability policies and provision, it shows how a range of different actors became engaged in shaping the disability services landscape during this period.  Drawing on a variety of sources, from government memoranda to RT\u00c9 television programmes, David Kilgannon traces the development of disability services on paper and in reality. This narrative is marked by instances of both striking transformation and significant continuity, as the emergence of new policy thinking occurred in tandem with the consolidation of established approaches. The book describes not only how services changed but why, offering a unique perspective on the evolution of Irish social policy in the post-war years",

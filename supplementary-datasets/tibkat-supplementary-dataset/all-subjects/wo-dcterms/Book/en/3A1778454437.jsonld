            "title": "Microwave Imaging and Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems",
            "abstract": "Microwave imaging techniques allow for the development of systems that are able to inspect, identify, and characterize in a noninvasive fashion under different scenarios, ranging from biomedical to subsurface diagnostics as well as from surveillance and security applications to nondestructive evaluation. Such great opportunities, though, are actually severely limited by difficulties arising from the solution of the underlying inverse scattering problem. As a result, ongoing research efforts in this area are devoted to developing inversion strategies and experimental apparatus so that they are as reliable and accurate as possible with respect to reconstruction capabilities and resolution performance, respectively. The intent of this Special Issue is to present the experiences of leading scientists in the electromagnetic inverse scattering community, as well as to serve as an assessment tool for people who are new to the area of microwave imaging and electromagnetic inverse scattering problems",

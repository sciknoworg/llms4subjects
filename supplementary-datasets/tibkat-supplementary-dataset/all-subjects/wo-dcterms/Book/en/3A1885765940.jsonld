The albums under investigation range from Early Modern Stammb\u00fccher, or alba amicorum, to albums assembled jointly by nineteenth-century cultural elites, and from muraqqa\u02bfs of the Persianate world to English and North American friendship albums, including some kept by women. This book is the first contribution to the comparative study of manuscript albums, focusing on their materiality and analysing the practices of all those involved in making and using them. Moreover, the collection introduces this hard-to-grasp type of written artefact to the field of cross-disciplinary manuscript studies and suggests albums as a touchstone for manuscriptological theories and terminologies.; Manuscript albums are oftentimes contradictory objects: ephemeral yet monumental, coherent yet inviting change.

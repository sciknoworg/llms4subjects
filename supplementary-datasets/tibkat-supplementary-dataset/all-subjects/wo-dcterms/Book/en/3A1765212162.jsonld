            "abstract": "This book analyzes, both theoretically and empirically, how diverse social and political identities such as ethnicity, culture, religion and gender can tackle risks such as violence, conflicts, and pandemics from the perspective of security. It is ambitious and valuable book analyzing how to confront political, social and international community\u2019s risks with norms and institutional reforms within the framework of neoliberal global competition. (--Professor Kumiko Haba, Aoyama Gakuin University and former Vice-President of Internationals Studies Association (ISA)) How do our experiences of identity shape our experience of risk in a rapidly changing, and increasingly insecure world? These are some of the critical questions that the book provides through exciting and vital insights for a more sustainable, secure future. (--Professor Bronwyn Hayward, MNZM, University of Canterbury, New Zealand, Member of Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change) This volume explores the complex interrelation between risk, identity and conflict and focuses specifically on ethnicity, religion and gender as modes of identity that are often associated with conflict in the contemporary world. It draws on theoretical perspectives as well as pays special attention to analysis of diverse case studies from Africa, Middle East, Europe, East and Southeast Asia and Latin America. Using various analytical tools and methodologies, it provides unique narratives of local and regional social risk factors and security complexities. The relationship between risk and security is multidimensional and perpetually changing, and lends itself to multiple interpretations. This publication provides a new ground for theoretical and policy debates to unlock innovative understanding of risk through analyses of identity as a significant factor in conflict in the world today. At the same time, it explores ways to address such conflicts in a more people-centered, empowering and sustainable way.

            "abstract": "As a result of the mandates of the Individual with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA), inclusive practices have become the norm for addressing the needs of all learners. In addition, these mandates require that steps must be taken to guarantee that all students are successful in all school settings, regardless of ability. Possibly now more than ever, educators should be experts in building collaborative relationships for inclusive settings. The perceived positive benefits of collaboration among teachers for inclusive settings creates a topic of interest. Research has begun to focus on the study of the deep, or integrated, collaborative relationships between special education and general education teachers and the use of inclusive learning communities to support practice.Building Integrated Collaborative Relationships for Inclusive Learning Settings provides background information on special education law, inclusion, and strategies for integrated collaborative relationships that include the creation of inclusion professional learning communities and a map for intended collaboration. Moreover, the book provides insights and supports professionals concerned with the evolving environment of schools and education and how to best meet the needs of all learners. This book is intended for teachers, special education teachers, counsellors, professionals, and researchers working in the field of education, and inservice and preservice teachers, administrators, teacher educators, practitioners, researchers, academicians, and students looking to improve their understanding on how to build and maintain practices to support inclusive learning settings",

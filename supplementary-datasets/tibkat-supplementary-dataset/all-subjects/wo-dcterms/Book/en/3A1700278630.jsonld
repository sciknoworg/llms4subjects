            "abstract": "\"Biochar and its implementation as a renewable-based material is one of the topics on which the research community has focused the greatest energy in the last twenty years. This book provides readers with a scientific and technological overview of biochar, including new technologies for biochar production, new environmental and agronomic applications (e.g., biochar as growing media component or biochar application for mine land restoration) and some emerging biochar applications in different fields (e.g., energy storage and catalysis). A special emphasis is placed on analyzing the links between the different stages of the value chain, underpinning the economic viability of biochar systems. Biochar as a renewable-based material : With applications in agriculture, the environment and energy is designed as a textbook for graduate and postgraduate courses, as well as, a handbook for early-stage scientists, policy makers and potential technology customers. The book is written by internationally recognized scientists with a variety of complementary backgrounds\"--",

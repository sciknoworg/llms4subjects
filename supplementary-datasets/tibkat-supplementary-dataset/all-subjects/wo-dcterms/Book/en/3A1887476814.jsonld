            "abstract": "\"This volume, Bio-Based Polymers and Composites: Properties, Durability, and Applications, takes its inspiration from Nature as the source of innumerable and priceless resources. When applying human ingenuity and experience to natural resources and processes, scientists and researchers can maximize the potential of nature for human benefit. In that vein, this new volume explores the latest breakthroughs in natural biopolymers, green composites, and green nanocomposites, a field that is rapidly expanding. This book consolidates information on the synthesis and applications of biopolymers, green composites, and green nanocomposites for various applications with detailed characterization, mechanical approaches, and theoretical consideration. Recent development in advanced devices using nanostructured materials are covered. This book provides fundamentals and advanced concepts for developing nanostructured materials based on biopolymers and their composites. The volume also looks at bio-based polymers and composites for environmental sustainability, such as in bioremediation and for wastewater treatment. It discusses natural polymers from waste products. It considers the use of bio-based polymers and composites in fertilization in horticulture as well as in industry and construction, for recycling of concrete, for gas sensing applications for safety, for fiber-reinforced epoxy composites, etc. In medicine, a study shows the use of biopolymers and green composites for measuring the blood glucose concentration of a patient. Over the past 20 years, the size and sophistication of natural polymers and biomaterials have significantly increased due to advances in science, technology, and business. The circumstance has compelled academic and industrial researchers to do substantial research in these fields. Academicians (undergraduate to doctoral students and researchers) and professionals will be interested in this volume\"--",

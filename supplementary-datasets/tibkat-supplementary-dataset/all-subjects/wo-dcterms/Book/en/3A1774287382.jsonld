                "\"The case for prevention of violent conflict has never been stronger. After declining steadily for decades, violent conflict has increased dramatically since 2010. Battle-related deaths, refugee numbers, and terrorist incidents have all reached historic highs, resulting in ever increasing peacekeeping budgets. This escalation in violent conflict has renewed the commitment to addressing the risk of violence early on, and in a coordinated way. More countries are affected by violent conflict today than at any time in the past 30 years. This includes middle-income countries, where over 70 percent of conflicts take place today. In 2016, 80 percent of battle-related deaths were due to 7 to 8 conflicts. However, lower intensity violence taking place in several countries also took a huge toll on societies and economies. By 2030, more than half of the world's poor will be in countries affected by high levels of violence. [This book] reaffirms that prevention is universal, takes time to accomplish, and is part and parcel of economic and social development. Prevention fosters inclusive societies where people have opportunity and can live without the fear of long-term violence. This report is a first step in working jointly to address the immense challenge of preventing violent conflict. It also explores concrete ways that countries and the international community can combine tools and approaches to reduce violent conflict. This in turn will contribute to reduce the immense suffering and devastating long-term impacts that violent conflict inflicts on societies.\"--"

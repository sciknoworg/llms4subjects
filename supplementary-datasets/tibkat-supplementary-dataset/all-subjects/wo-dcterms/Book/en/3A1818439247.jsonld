            "abstract": "\"Beer is made up of various bioactive substances containing antioxidants and specific ingredients with potentially beneficial effects on the human body if consumed in moderation. In the production process, the addition of hops, cereals, and malt leads to an increased content of naturally occurring antioxidant compounds in beer, mainly phenolic compounds. This book presents information on the history, compositional analysis, and brewing process of craft beers. It covers aspects of fruit fortification including phenolic content and antioxidant activity of various craft beers. It introduces selective improvisation for best possible combinations and proportions of fruits to manufacture quality beers. This book presents detailed literature available till date and our research done in selective improvisation of the most popular alcoholic beverage -beer. The book covers aspects of fruit fortification to different craft brewed beers and how it will enhance the nutritional composition, antioxidant properties, TPCs, color and sensory attributes of beers. The alcohol industry continues to grow quickly worldwide - this book provides relevant research literature about the recent studies and experimentation about beers which will be helpful to students, researchers, industrialists, producers, and many others. The incorporation of fruits for the fortification of beers is a hot new area of research - this will result in the need for more innovative and effective methods and steps in the production of newer variants of beers\"--",

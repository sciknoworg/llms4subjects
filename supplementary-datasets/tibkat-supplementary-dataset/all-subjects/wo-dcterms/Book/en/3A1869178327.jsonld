            "title": "Chapter 9: Capacity development and knowledge transfer on the climate, land, water and energy nexus",
            "abstract": "The use of resources such as land, energy and water - and their relation to the climate - are linked. They are tied into supply chains that provide services such as food, drinking water, heating, information and communications technology and others. There are many links between these chains. The sets of links are often referred to as the nexus. Functional understanding of these links, and the resulting interdependencies, is limited. This limited understanding is a barrier to appropriate planning and policy design. This is because the 'sectoral division' within government often has blinkered vision or authority. It either does not 'see' these linkages or, if it does, its policy does not have authority over their management. This chapter explores the importance of disseminating knowledge of the nexus among key actors. These include policy, business and civil society, academic and vocational levels, and researchers. We present an initial set of knowledge dissemination activities. They demonstrate how various analytical and governance barriers can be overcome. We focus on the nexus of the Climate, Land, Energy and Water systems (CLEWs) and their subsequent supply chains. The nexus and CLEWs have become terms that describe a type of integrated analysis. They are sometimes referred to as 'frameworks'. We examine the initiative under the nexus and CLEWs banners and similar approaches. From this, we distil insights and recommendations",

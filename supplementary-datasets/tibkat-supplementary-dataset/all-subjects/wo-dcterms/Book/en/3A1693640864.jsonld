            "abstract": "\"Optimization is the process of obtaining the most appropriate solution by providing certain constraints for the given purpose or purposes. Mathematically, optimization can be briefly defined as minimizing or maximizing a function. In short, optimization is to look for the best. The best found is called \"optimum. Optimization is used to accelerate decision-making processes and to solve real-life problems in an effective, accurate and real-time manner. In addition to the economic benefits, optimization is also used as an effective method to include the preferences and constraints of customers, employers and employees in the decision process and to improve the quality of the resources in the system. The purpose of optimization is to achieve the best result, the best goal. Improvements can be made to the current situation or situations to achieve the best result. One of the major shortcomings in optimization and robotic is the transformation of theoretical knowledge into practice. The purpose of the book is to introduce students, teachers, researchers, and practitioners to new advances in this area. The book content includes theoretical and practical studies prepared with the academic contributions of scientists working in different fields. It was decided to publish each chapter in the book after being examined by the scientific board. As an editor, my duty is to ensure breadth, while the chapter authors treat the delegated chapters with depth. The book is designed for practitioners or researchers of all levels of expertise from novice to expert. Each of the book's individual topics could be considered as a compact, self-contained mini-book right under its title. The approach is to provide a framework and a set of techniques for evaluating and improving optimization and robotic. It presents a specific set of solutions, mostly obtained from real world projects and experimental studies, for routine applications. It further highlights promising emerging techniques for research and exploration opportunities. The development team of this book wants to thank their colleagues who made contributions to this book by providing continuous encouragements and thorough reviews of the chapters of the book\"--",

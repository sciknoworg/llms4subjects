            "abstract": "\"Since the invention of computers or machines, scientists and researchers are trying very hard to enhance their capabilities to perform various tasks. As a consequence, the capabilities of computers are growing exponentially day by day in terms of diverse working domains, versatile jobs, processing speed, and reduced size. Now, we are in the race to make the computers or machines as intelligent as human beings. Artificial Intelligence (AI) came up as a way of making a computer or computer software think in the similar manner the intelligent humans think. AI is inspired by the study of human brain like how humans think, learn, decide and act while trying to solve a problem. The outcomes of this study are the basis of developing intelligent software and systems or Intelligent Computing (IC). An IC system has the capability of reasoning, learning, problem solving, perception, and linguistic intelligence. The IC systems consist of AI techniques as well as other emerging techniques that make a system intelligent. The use of intelligent computing has been seen in almost every sub-domain of computer science such as networking, software engineering, gaming, natural language processing, computer vision, image processing, data science, robotics, expert systems, and security. Now a days, the use of IC can also be seen for solving various complex problems in diverse domains such as for predicting disease in medical science, predicting land fertility or crop productivity in agriculture science, predicting market growth in economics, weather forecasting and so on. For all these reasons, this book presents the advances in AI techniques, under the umbrella of IC. In this context, the book includes the recent research works have been done in the areas of machine learning, neural networks, deep learning, evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence, fuzzy systems and so on. This book provides theoretical, algorithmic, simulation, and implementation-based recent research advancements related to the Intelligent Computing\"--",

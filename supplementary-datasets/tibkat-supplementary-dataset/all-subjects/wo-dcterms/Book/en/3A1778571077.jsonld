            "title": "Enzyme Inhibitors and Activators",
            "abstract": "Over the recent years, medicinal chemistry has become responsible for explaining interactions of chemical molecule processes such that many scientists in the life sciences from agronomy to medicine are engaged in medicinal research. This book contains an overview focusing on the research area of enzyme inhibitor and activator, enzyme-catalyzed biotransformation, usage of microbial enzymes, enzymes associated with programmed cell death, natural products as potential enzyme inhibitors, protease inhibitors from plants in insect pest management, peptidases, and renin-angiotensin system. The book provides an overview on basic issues and some of the recent developments in medicinal science and technology. Especially, emphasis is devoted to both experimental and theoretical aspect of modern medicine. The primary target audience for the book includes students, researchers, chemists, molecular biologists, medical doctors, pharmacologists, and professionals who are interested in associated areas. The textbook is written by international scientists with expertise in biochemistry, enzymology, molecular biology, and genetics, many of which are active in biochemical and pharmacological research. I would like to acknowledge the authors for their contribution to the book. We hope that the textbook will enhance the knowledge of scientists in the complexities of some medical approaches; it will stimulate both professionals and students to dedicate part of their future research in understanding relevant mechanisms and applications of pharmacology",

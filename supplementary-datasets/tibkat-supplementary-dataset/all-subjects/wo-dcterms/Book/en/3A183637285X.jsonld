            "title": "The Responsibility of Intellectuals : Reflections by Noam Chomsky and others after 50 years",
            "abstract": "With the publication of \u2018The Responsibility of Intellectuals\u2019 half a century ago, Noam Chomsky burst onto the US political scene as a leading critic of the war in Vietnam. Privilege, he argues, brings with it the responsibility to tell the truth and expose lies, but our intellectual culture only pays lip-service to this ideal. The essay has been described as \u2018the single most influential piece of anti-war literature\u2019 of the Vietnam War period.  Since then, Chomsky has continued to equip a growing international audience with the facts and arguments needed to understand \u2013 and change \u2013 our world. According to The New York Times, Chomsky \u2018may be the most widely read American voice on foreign policy on the planet today\u2019.  This book revisits \u2018The Responsibility of Intellectuals\u2019 half a century on. It includes six new essays written to celebrate Chomsky\u2019s famous intervention and explore its relevance in today\u2019s world. Nicholas Allott, Chris Knight, Milan Rai and Neil Smith have studied and written about Chomsky\u2019s thought for many years, while Craig Murray and Jackie Walker describe the personal price they have paid for speaking out. The book finishes with Chomsky\u2019s recollections of the background to the original publication of his essay, followed by extensive commentary from him on its 50th anniversary",

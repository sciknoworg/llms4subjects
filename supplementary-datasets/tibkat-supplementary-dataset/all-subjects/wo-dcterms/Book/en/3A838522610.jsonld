            "abstract": "The architects, designers, artists and others represented in Fifty Under Fifty are innovators of our time. After a world-wide search of 50 top architecture and design firms by the editors, lead author Beverly Russell along with Eva Maddox and Farooq Ameen help bring together a unique body of work; all partners in these firms will be 50 years old or under at the time of publication, and represent a forward-thinking generation of creative people, aware of global issues that urgently need solutions through imaginative design. A distinguished five-person jury presided over the final selection: Stanley Tigerman, founding partner, Tiger McCurry, Chicago; Ralph Johnson, design principal, Perkins+Will, Chicago; Jeanne Gang, founder Gang Studio, Chicago; Marion Weiss, founding partner, Weiss Manfredi, New York; and Qingyun Ma, Dean of Architecture, University of Southern California, and founder MADAs.p.a.m., Shanghai and Beijing.The innovators featured in this impressive volume share with us, and the world, their desires for exponential learning; designs are illuminated with full-colour photography and detailed illustrations, helping to showcase the innovators individual curiosities, imaginations, and talents.This material shows how they bridge disciplines, respect cultural norms, respond to human needs regardless of costs, and how they adopt team transparency in their passion to create and solve problems with a clear mission. This highly anticipated book showcases honorees located across many different countries, including Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, and the United States. Significantly, a quarter of these innovators are women, representing the elevated leadership of women in architecture and design.",

During the Enlightenment, many men and women of letters envisaged the continent?s future in particular when stressing their hope that peace could be secured in Europe. The texts gathered here, and signed by major thinkers of the time (Rousseau, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Kant, Hume or Stae\u034f\u0308l for instance), as well as by writers history has forgotten, present the reflections, with a couple of chronological extensions (from Sully to Victor Hugo) of authors from the long eighteenth century?the French Empire and the fall of Napoleon generated numerous upheavals?on Europe, its history, its diversity, but also on what the nations, which, in all their diversity, make up a geographical unit, have in common. They show the historical origins of the project of a European union, the desire to consolidate the continent?s ties to the Maghreb or to Turkey, the importance granted to commerce and the worries engendered by history?s convulsions, but also the hope vested in future generations.The Idea of Europe follows its sister edition in French, L?id\u00e9e de l?Europe au Si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res, also published by Open Book",

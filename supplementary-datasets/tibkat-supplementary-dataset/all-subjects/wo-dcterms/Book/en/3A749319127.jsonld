            "abstract": "This book consists of papers and final recommendations on Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), presented at the 4th European EIA Workshop which was held from 29 May to 1 June 1997 in Potsdam, Germany. The main objectives of this workshop were to specify current SEA-related methodologies and procedures, and to identify major deficiencies; to identify constraints on SEA implementation in the Member States; and to identify SEA research and training needs and methods. The book contains contributions on recent SEA research developments and covers a wide range of topics, including a contribution from the European Commission on SEA developments in the EU, with a proposal for a council directive on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment. Other papers, particularly from the Federal Environmental Ministries of the EU Member States, deal with SEA legislation and procedures in the European Community, an Austrian SEA study, EIA/SEA for structural funds and the development of environmental quality objectives, the Erlangen case study on SEA in land use planning, and SEA research strategy in Europe. The discussion is not limited to SEA for plans and programmes but also includes environmental assessment for policies, for instance the Danish experience with SEA in policy-making, environmental assessment of policies in The Netherlands, and inclusion of environmental considerations into Ministerial Recommendations for Cabinet's decisions by the Federal Government in Canada. The book shows that SEA is already part of some sectoral planning procedures within the Member States, mostly for land use planning. It is acknowledged to be a valuable instrument for including environmental considerations early in the planning process. There may be methodological, procedural or political constraints on implementation of SEA at all planning levels, but they can be overcome by practice and research. Audience: Environmental professionals, whether academic, governmental or in the private consultancy sector",

            "abstract": "This book discusses dynamical systems that are typically driven by stochastic dynamic noise. It is written by two statisticians essentially for the statistically inclined readers, although readers whose primary interests are in determinate systems will find some of the methodology explained in this book of interest. The statistical approach adopted in this book differs in many ways from the deterministic approach to dynamical systems. Even the very basic notion of initial-value sensitivity requires careful development in the new setting provided. This book covers, in varying depth, many of the contributions made by the statisticians in the past twenty years or so towards our understanding of estimation, the Lyapunov-like index, the nonparametric regression, and many others, many of which are motivated by their dynamical system counterparts but have now acquired a distinct statistical flavour.

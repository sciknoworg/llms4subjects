            "title": "Geographic Hotspots for World Bank Action on Climate Change and Health",
            "abstract": "In the last five years, the number of voices calling for stronger international action on climate change and health has increased, as has the scale and depth of activities. But current global efforts in climate and health are inadequately integrated. As a result, actions to address climate change including World Bank Group investment and lending are missing opportunities to simultaneously promote better health outcomes and resilience.This paper begins by identifying the health impacts that are being felt today and that are projected to worsen in the future without efforts to ensure health considerations are central to any and all climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. Chapter 1 includes an outline of the scope of health impacts from climate change and its drivers, the means of transmission, and a description of the drivers of climate change, and their sources. Chapter 2 describes the methodology used to identify these nations and determine their preparedness for coping with these impacts. Chapter 3 identifies hotspot countries based on this analysis, and narrows the focus to those countries that are both most likely to bear the brunt of a greater burden of disease and death from climate change and climate drivers, and that are the least ready to cope. Coping mechanisms through mitigation and adaptation measures, are outlined in Chapter 4, as are the multiple benefits that can be expected from multi-sector, concerted efforts to address health impacts from climate change, and its drivers",

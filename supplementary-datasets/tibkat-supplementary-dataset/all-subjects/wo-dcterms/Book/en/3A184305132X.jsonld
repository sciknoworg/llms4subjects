            "abstract": "\"The capacity of Pacific Island Countries and Territories to prevent and respond to marine litter is limited and most countries do not yet have in place adequate waste management and pollution minimisation plans. Most importantly, several Pacific Island countries have yet to become Parties to the various conventions and protocols relating to the protection of the marine environment, including the MARPOL, London and Noumea Conventions. The 2017-04 Conservation Management Measure on Marine Pollution that, if implemented, will do much to minimise fishing industry waste is scheduled to come into force 1 January 2019. With over 98% of our region covered by ocean, marine litter impacts to ecosystems and coastal communities are heightened by the reliance of island communities upon healthy ocean ecosystems and services. Pacific Island Countries and Territories can also be particularly vulnerable to marine litter impacts due to financial and institutional challenges in properly managing waste before it is transported by wind or water to the marine environment. It is therefore imperative that a suite of activities, as outlined by this Action Plan are implemented across all Pacific island Countries and Territories - that the foundation policy and regulatory frameworks are implemented, where necessary enhanced as in the case of Take Away Food and Beverage Containers, and most importantly then enforced by all. This will set an excellent foundation for the various improved management, awareness, infrastructure and clean up activities that will be resourced through this Action Plan\"--Conclusion",

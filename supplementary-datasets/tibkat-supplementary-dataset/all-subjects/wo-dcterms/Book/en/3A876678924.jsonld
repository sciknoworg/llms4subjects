Providing innovative guidelines, methods, examples, and templates consistent with capability models and standards, this book approaches EVM from a practical level with understandable techniques that are applicable to the management of any project.Clear and unambiguous instructions explain how to incorporate EVM with key systems engineering, software engineering, and project management processes such as establishing the technical or quality baseline, requirements management, using product metrics, and meeting success criteria for technical reviews. Detailed information is included on linking product requirements, project work products, the project plan, and the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB), as well as correlating technical performance measures (TPM) with EVM. With straightforward instructions on how to use EVM on a simple project, such as building a house, and on complex projects, such as high-risk IT and engineering development projects, it is the only book that includes excerpts from the PMI's Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), CMMI, the EVM System standard, systems engineering standards, federal acquisition regulations, and Department of Defense guides.Performance-Based Earned Value allows both novices and experienced project managers-including project managers of suppliers and customers in the commercial and government sectors; software and systems engineering process improvement leaders; CMMI appraisers; PMI members; and IEEE Computer Society members-to:. Incorporate product requirements and planned quality into the PMB. Conduct an Integrated Baseline Review. Analyze performance reports. Perform independent assessments and predictive analysis. Ensure that key TPMs are selected, monitored, and reported. Identify the right success criteria for technical reviews. Develop techniques for monitoring and controlling supplier performance. Integrate risk management with EVM. Comply with government acquisition policies and regulationsWritten by Paul Solomon and Ralph Young, internationally recognized industry experts, Performance-Based Earned Value is constructed from guidance in standards and capability models for EVM, systems engineering, software engineering, and project management. It is the ...",

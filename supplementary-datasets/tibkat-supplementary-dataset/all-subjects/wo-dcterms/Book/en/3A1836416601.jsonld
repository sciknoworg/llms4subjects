            "abstract": "Accurate description of materials requires the most advanced atomic-scale techniques from both experimental and theoretical areas. In spite of the vast number of available techniques,  however, the experimental study of the atomic-scale properties and phenomena even in  simple solids is rather difficult. In steels the challenges become more complex due to the  interplay between the structural, chemical and magnetic effects. On the other hand,  advanced computational methods based on density functional theory ensure a proper  platform for studying the fundamental properties of steel materials from first-principles. In  1980\u2019s the first-principles description of the thermodynamic properties of elemental iron  was still on the borderline of atomistic simulations. Today the numerous application- oriented activities at the industrial and academic sectors are paired by a rapidly increasing  scientific interest. This is reflected by the number of publications on ab initio steel research,  which has increased from null to about one thousand within the last two decades. Our  research group has a well established position in developing and applying computational  codes for steel related applications. Using our ab initio tools, we have presented an insight to  the electronic and magnetic structure, and micromechanical properties of austenite and  ferrite stainless steel alloys. In the present contribution, we review the most important  developments within the ab initio quantum mechanics aided steel design with special emphasis  on the role of magnetism on the fundamental properties of alloy steels",

            "abstract": "This book examines switched systems from a control-theoretic perspective, focusing on stability analysis and control synthesis of systems that combine continuous dynamics with switching events. The theory of such switched systems is related to the study of hybrid systems, which has recently attracted considerable attention among control theorists, computer scientists, and practicing engineers. Aimed at readers with a background in systems and control, this book bridges the gap between classical mathematical control theory and the interdisciplinary field of hybrid systems. The book is divided into three main parts: * Part I introduces the classes of systems studied in the book * Part II develops stability theory for switched systems; it covers single and multiple Lyapunov function analysis methods, Lie-algebraic stability criteria, stability under limited-rate switching, and switched systems with various types of useful special structures * Part III is devoted to switching control design; it describes several wide classes of continuous-time control systems for which the logic-based switching paradigm emerges naturally as a control design tool. Switching control algorithms for several specific problems are discussed. The text adopts a progressive approach, presenting elementary concepts informally and more advanced topics with greater rigor. Results are first derived for linear systems and then extended to nonlinear systems. Full proofs for most results are provided. An extensive bibliography and a section of technical and historical notes complete the work. Requiring only familiarity with the basic theory of linear systems, the book is suitable as a text for a graduate course on switched systems and switching control. It may also serve as an introduction to this active area of research for control theorists and mathematicians, as well as a useful reference for experts in the field",

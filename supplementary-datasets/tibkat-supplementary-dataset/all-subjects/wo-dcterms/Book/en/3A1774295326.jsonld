            "title": "Seismic Risk Reduction Strategy for Public School Buildings in Peru",
            "abstract": "The Ministry of Education of Peru (MINEDU), through the General Directorate for School Infrastructure (DIGEIE), prepared the National School Infrastructure Plan to 2025 (PNIE). Within this framework, the MINEDU commissioned the National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI) with carrying out the School Infrastructure Census (CIE) which started on September 2013 and was completed in 2014. The MINEDU requested the World Bank's technical assistance for the analysis of the results obtained from the CIE as well as for devising a strategy to reduce seismic vulnerability and for the formulation of the PNIE. Under this program, a nationwide probabilistic seismic risk assessment of school infrastructure was carried out, which constitutes the basis for defining the seismic risk reduction strategies and for setting intervention priorities to optimize the required investments. In turn, the risk reduction strategy aims mainly to reduce the risk of death or injuries in the educational community to reduce damages to the property and infrastructure, and to minimize disruption of the educational services in the event of an earthquake. This note presents a summary of the seismic risk assessment of the school infrastructure countrywide and a strategy for reducing its vulnerability. This study is an integral part of the main results of a program funded by the Government of Japan and the global facility for disaster reduction and recovery (GFDRR), the main objective of which is to integrate disaster risk management into infrastructure sectors",

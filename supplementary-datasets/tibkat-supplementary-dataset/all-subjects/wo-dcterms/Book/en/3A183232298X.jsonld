            "title": "Current Perspective on the Study of Liquid-Fluid Interfaces: From Fundamentals to Innovative Applications",
            "abstract": "Fluid interfaces are promising candidates for confining different types of materials - e.g., polymers, surfactants, colloids, and even small molecules - and for designing new functional materials with reduced dimensionality. The development of such materials requires a deepening of the Physico-chemical bases underlying the formation of layers at fluid interfaces, as well as on the characterization of their structures and properties. This is of particular importance because the constraints associated with the assembly of materials at the interface lead to the emergence of equilibrium and dynamics features in the interfacial systems, which are far from those conventionally found in the traditional materials. This Special Issue is devoted to studies on fundamental and applied aspects of fluid interfaces, trying to provide a comprehensive perspective on the current status of the research field",

            "abstract": "This report presents the findings of the Service Delivery Indicators in the education sector in Togo in 2013. Survey implementation was preceded by extensive consultation with Government and key stakeholders on survey design, sampling, and adaptation of survey instruments. Pre-testing of the survey instruments, training of field staff, and field-work took place in 2013. Information was collected from 200 primary schools, 1,141 teachers, and 1,938 grade four pupils in Togo. The results provide a representative snapshot of the quality of service delivery and the physical environment within which services are delivered in public primary schools. The survey provides information on three levels of service delivery: measures of: (i) teacher effort; (ii) teacher knowledge and ability; and (iii) the availability of key inputs, such as textbooks, basic teaching equipment, and infrastructure (such as sanitation, quality of lighting etc.). The results indicate an adequate number of teachers to serve the population's needs, but they lack the necessary skills and inputs. Absence rate is a factor, although relatively lower than in other countries, except during teacher strikes. The reliance on volunteer teachers also creates challenges as only the present discounted value of future earnings can be considered a source of motivation for them.1 Efforts are needed in all major dimensions surveyed (competence, absence rate, inputs), although recent textbook provision efforts appear to have already made an impact",

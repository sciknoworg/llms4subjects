            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Pollution: Causes, Effects and Control is the fourth edition of a best-selling introductory level book dealing with chemical and radioactive pollution in its broadest sense. The scope of the book ranges from the sources of pollutants and their environmental behaviour, to their effects on human and non-human receptors, to the technologies and strategies available for control. The fourth edition has been wholly revised and updated from the previous edition due to the rapid pace of developments in this field. Topics covered include chemical pollution of freshwater and marine environments, drinking water quality, water pollution biology, sewage and its treatment, toxic wastes, air pollution and atmospheric chemistry, control of pollutant emissions, land contamination, solid waste management, clean technologies, persistent organic pollutants in the environment, environmental radioactivity, health effects of environmental chemicals, legal control of pollution and integrated pollution control. There is a completely new chapter on Clean Technologies and Industrial Ecology, reflecting the growing importance of pollution prevention as opposed to end-of-pipe solutions.  Whilst originally intended as an introductory reference work for professionals within the field, the book has been widely adopted for teaching purposes at the undergraduate and postgraduate level",

            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Fundamental Toxicology is a concise and comprehensive review of toxicology. It is based on the highly successful Fundamental Toxicology for Chemists and has been enriched and expanded. Every chapter in this new edition has been revised and updated, and four new chapters have been added. With contributions from internationally recognised experts in their field, this broad-based introduction to the topic covers both well-established and rapidly developing areas of toxicology, such as toxicogenomics, reproductive toxicology, behavioural toxicology and ecotoxicology. The book was written and published with the support of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The book includes new information on: risk assessment and risk management; toxicogenomics; effects of toxic substances on the human body; environmental distribution of chemicals and ecotoxicology; clinical toxicology; pharmaceutical toxicology; and aspects of laboratory measurement and safe laboratory practice. Fundamental Toxicology is ideal for students and includes extensive pedagogical features, such as an extensive glossary, a bibliography after each chapter and recommended further reading.  It is also designed for teachers and lecturers, especially those who may be teaching toxicology for the first time. Included is a suggested curriculum for using the text to teach toxicology to students from various scientific disciplines. Professionals working in toxicology and related fields will find this an invaluable guide",

                "This book introduces state-of-the-art models and methods based on the neuroendocrine-immune-inspired approaches in the field of manufacturing control systems. It develops various bio-inspired intelligent approaches for multiple applications in order to efficiently generate production plans and control solutions and agilely deal with the frequent unexpected disturbances at the shop floor level. It also provides an introduction to bio-inspired manufacturing systems with intelligent control structures and the latest technologies. Further, the book describes recent advances in the bio-inspired methodology for a high-level adaptability in manufacturing systems, including the bio-inspired control architecture and the implementation of intelligent and adaptive control approaches based on neuroendocrine-immune mechanisms and hormone-regulation principles. It offers a valuable resource for graduate students, researchers and engineers in the fields of production management, manufacturing system control and related areas. .",

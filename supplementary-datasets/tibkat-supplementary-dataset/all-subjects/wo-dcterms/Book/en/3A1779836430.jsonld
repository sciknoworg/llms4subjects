            "abstract": [
                "This open access book aims to set an agenda for research and action in the field of Digital Humanism through short essays written by selected thinkers from a variety of disciplines, including computer science, philosophy, education, law, economics, history, anthropology, political science, and sociology. This initiative emerged from the Vienna Manifesto on Digital Humanism and the associated lecture series. Digital Humanism deals with the complex relationships between people and machines in digital times. It acknowledges the potential of information technology. At the same time, it points to societal threats such as privacy violations and ethical concerns around artificial intelligence, automation and loss of jobs, ongoing monopolization on the Web, and sovereignty. Digital Humanism aims to address these topics with a sense of urgency but with a constructive mindset. The book argues for a Digital Humanism that analyses and, most importantly, influences the complex interplay of technology and humankind toward a better society and life while fully respecting universal human rights. It is a call to shaping technologies in accordance with human values and needs. \u201cTasty eclectic buffet of ideas from diverse thinkers pointing the way towards a future in which technologists and humanists are in productive dialogs to reshape both communities. We need more of this.\u201c - Ben Shneiderman, University of Maryland, USA \u201cAt the heart of our questioning on the future of humanity in a digital world, a must-read compilation of articles from renowned and inspired experts which will help you explore the different facets of the enthralling concept of Digital Humanism.\u201d- Anna Asimakopoulou, Member of the European Parliament, Greece \u201cInstead of running after the latest technologies, Digital Humanism invites a return to the foundational elements: dignity, freedom, democracy and free choice. The assessment of how technology and artificial intelligence may disrupt those is a strong reminder of what is at stake.\u201d \u2013 Marietje Schaake, Stanford University, USA.",

            "abstract": "Osmotically driven membrane processes (ODMPs) including forward osmosis (FO) and pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) have attracted increasing attention in fields such as water treatment, desalination, power generation, and life science. In contrast to pressure-driven membrane processes, e.g., reverse osmosis, which typically employs applied high pressure as driving force, ODMPs take advantages of naturally generated osmotic pressure as the sole source of driving force. In light of this, ODMPs possess many advantages over pressure-driven membrane processes. The advantages include low energy consumption, ease of equipment maintenance, low capital investment, high salt rejection, and high water flux. In the past decade, over 300 academic papers on ODMPs have been published in a variety of application fields. The number of such publications is still rapidly growing. The ODMPs' approach, fabrications, recent development and applications in wastewater treatment, power generation, seawater desalination, and gas absorption are presented in this book",

            "abstract": "The field of women\u2019s history was flourishing in the 1980s, encouraging the study of more and more aspects of women\u2019s lives, including their paid labor. In 1985 Dolores Janiewski\u2019s Sisterhood Denied: Race, Gender, and Class in a New South Community joined the ranks of books devoted to the study of women\u2019s work and its contribution to the wealth of their communities. Her study of Durham, North Carolina and her focused analysis of the work of both black and white southern women in particular makes Sisterhood Denied a classic of southern labor history and women\u2019s history. Janiewski examined how a \u201cnew,\" industrial South was built in part on women\u2019s labor, explored women\u2019s lives at the intersections, and analyzed the potential for and disconnect in women\u2019s relationships with labor unions, leaving a path for future scholars of southern women workers to follow",

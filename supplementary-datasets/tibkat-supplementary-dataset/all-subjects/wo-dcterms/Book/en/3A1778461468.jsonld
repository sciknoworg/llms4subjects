            "abstract": "Two Twelfth-Century Texts on Chinese Painting presents two texts in translation that provide dual insight into the Painting Academy of Emperor Hui-tsung and the literati school of painting.  The Shan-shui ch\u2019un-ch\u2019uan chi is a treatise for beginning landscape painters dated to the Hs\u00fcan-ho era. The treatise was written by Han Cho, a reputed member of the Academy, but the text was not specifically directed at Academicians. The treatise collects and orders previous writings on landscape painting; one of Han Cho\u2019s main goals is to list all landscape definitions and their practical application in painting. Yet his view is more detached and analytical than a stereotypical Academy painter, revealing an approach reminiscent of Confucian scholarship and literati painting as well.  The Hua-chi by Teng Ch\u2019un is a history of painting that was written as a sequel to two earlier painting histories. In ten chapters, Teng Ch\u2019un compiles facts and critical evaluations of painters from 1075 to 1167, as well as listings of selected masterpieces. Teng Ch\u2019un provides more specific information about the Academy than Han Cho, discussing its organization and examination system, and noting that \u201cform-likeness\u201d and adherence to rules were leading standards for painting in the Academy. On the other hand, he thinks that painting should transmit \u201csoul,\u201d not just \u201cform.\u201d Thus, Teng Ch\u2019un writes the history of both the establishment values of the Academy and the intellectual tendencies of the literati",

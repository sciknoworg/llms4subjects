                "This book was developed during a particular pandemic situation in the whole world which confined people to their homes. Therefore, there was a rise in the use of distance working and learning (e-learning) which led to a very quick adoption of technology in order to guarantee different approaches to fulfil the same or better outcomes and ensure that people are connected. This book provides a better understanding about the importance of teams' assessment and collaborative work, as well as the use of collaboration tools and online assessment techniques supported by technology. Consequently, the book is aimed at all institutions that seek new working environments, namely higher education institutions, companies and organizations, sports teams, and others. Furthermore, this book provides new approaches and systems to carry the knowledge and learning assessment. The book gathers knowledge from several authors, related to collaboration environments and tools, as well as their insights on how technology can be applied to carry assessment processes. The book seeks to provide knowledge on new technologies and different learning environments."

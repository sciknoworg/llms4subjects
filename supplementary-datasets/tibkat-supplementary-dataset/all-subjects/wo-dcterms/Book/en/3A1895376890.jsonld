                "Discover a groundbreaking approach to introducing DevSecOps. DevSecOps Adventures uses three innovative games to help you to maximize engagement in your training and transform learners\u2019 mindsets, turning even reluctant sceptics into supporters and advocates of the DevOps culture. The book\u2019s first coaching game uses LEGO, Chocolate, and role cards to explore the roles and interdependencies of Dev, Ops, and Security. Readers will experience Aha! moments, expand their individual roles, develop T-shaped skills, and experiment with changing organizational culture. The simulations depict an end-to-end product delivery process, highlighting bottlenecks in the value delivery flow. Additionally, the book is updated with two new games, \"Fear in the Workplace\" and \"Safety in the Workplace\" which provide insights into safety culture, drawing inspiration from the works of Ron Westrum, William Kahn, Amy C. Edmondson, and Dr. David Rock. Through open conversations, participants learn to identify signs of a fear-ridden culture and apply safety-enhancing practices to foster a culture of experimentation and learning. This Second Edition is enhanced with real-life examples and includes the insights from important State of DevOps reports. The updated \u201cKey Takeaway\u201d chapter and the new FAQ chapter prepare trainers to deliver an impactful learning experience. It serves as a facilitation guide for gamified experiential learning, provides ideas for effective debriefing, and helps readers relate the issues highlighted in the coaching games to similar challenges they may face in their organizations. What You Will Learn: Gain fundamental understanding of DevOps, DevSecOps, and Safety Culture. Develop the capability to prepare, facilitate, and effectively debrief these coaching games with your teams. Showcase how playfulness can help teams bring down a \"wall of confusion\" between the different functional silos. ."

            "abstract": "The aim of An Update in Dental Implantology and Biomaterial is to continue the challenge of reconstruction and implantology into another volume with unique updates. As a surgeon who is usually asked to accomplish the reconstructive skeleton of the rehabilitation plan, questions like \"Doc, I am in a hurry, how fast can you finish the treatment?\" are becoming very common in practice these days. This phenomenon goes hand in hand with people's current lifestyles. Another challenge is the inapplicable prosthetic plan due to the difficulty at the patient side or the surgical intervention side. The advancement in reconstruction is appreciated, but apparently it has not reached the limit of placing the factors of cost, time, and invasiveness into one location. I believe that cases should be treated and rehabilitated as soon as possible, with reasonable cost and feasible technicality, so that clients can focus on their daily lives. With this book I am honored to present a homogeneous gathering of literature on implantology, elaborated with up-to-date techniques of grafting, the improvement of anterior aesthetics, and answers to questions concerning postoperative implant complications and microbiota care",

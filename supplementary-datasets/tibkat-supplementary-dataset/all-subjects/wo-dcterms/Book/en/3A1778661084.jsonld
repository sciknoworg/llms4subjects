            "title": "Advances in Internal Combustion Engines and Fuel Technologies",
            "abstract": "This book highlights the important need for more efficient and environmentally sound combustion technologies that utilise renewable fuels to be continuously developed and adopted. The central theme here is two-fold: internal combustion engines and fuel solutions for combustion systems. Internal combustion engines remain as the main propulsion system used for ground transportation, and the number of successful developments achieved in recent years is as varied as the new design concepts introduced. It is therefore timely that key advances in engine technologies are organised appropriately so that the fundamental processes, applications, insights and identification of future development can be consolidated. In the future and across the developed and emerging markets of the world, the range of fuels used will significantly increase as biofuels, new fossil fuel feedstock and processing methods, as well as variations in fuel standards continue to influence all combustion technologies used now and in coming streams. This presents a challenge requiring better understanding of how the fuel mix influences the combustion processes in various systems. The book allows extremes of the theme to be covered in a simple yet progressive way",

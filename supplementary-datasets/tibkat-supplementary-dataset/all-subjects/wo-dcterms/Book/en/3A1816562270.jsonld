Waste Problems and Management in Developing Countries provides a comprehensive overview of the characterization, issues, and regulatory development of waste management for sustainable solutions and prevention techniques. It covers the various types of pollution, including pollution from plastics, industrial activities, metals, livestock, healthcare, food loss and waste, etc. It explores new techniques for thermal and radioactive waste management and includes such methods as vermicomposting and composting for organic wastes management and profitable use. The volume also looks at the role of modern technologies and legislation measures to manage biosolid waste. The volume includes numerous data sets obtained from various surveys and highlights special categories of waste that may not fit precisely into either RCRA Subtitle D (solid wastes) or Subtitle C (hazardous wastes). Academicians, researchers, and students will find the volume to be a comprehensible volume about waste management and its diversity, exploration, exploitation, and management strategies\"--",

            "abstract": "\"This textbook is intended for the first course of engineering dynamics for undergraduate students. Engineering dynamics is a rigorous topic that typically involves the intensive use of vector mathematics and calculus. This book, however, uses plain language with less vector mathematics and calculus to introduce these topics of mathematics to students with a high school physics background. Numerous practical examples are provided with their step-by-step worked out solutions, as well as case studies to reflect the interests of new engineering and applied engineering students. The topics covered in the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination are presented throughout the text. It also includes roadway dynamics to incorporate engineering dynamics and the transportation engineering for civil engineering. Features: Discusses theory using easy-to-understand language with less vector mathematics and calculus Includes practical case studies and numerous realistic step-by-step solved examples Includes exercise problems for students' practice Provides numerous sample examples related to the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam Includes a solutions manual and PowerPoint slides for adopting instructors Engineering Dynamics: Fundamentals and Applications serves as a useful resource for students across several engineering degree programs, such as civil, mechanical, aerospace, automotive, chemical, and electrical engineering. It is also appropriate for engineering technology and applied science students as well\"--",

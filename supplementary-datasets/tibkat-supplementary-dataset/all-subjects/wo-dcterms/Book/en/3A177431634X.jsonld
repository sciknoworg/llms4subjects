            "abstract": "Maintaining trade flows as much as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic will be crucial in providing access to essential food and health supplies and in limiting the negative impacts on jobs and poverty. The implementation of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) provides governments with a sound framework for improving trade facilitation and border management. During this crisis implementing measures contained in the TFA can contribute to ensure that trade in critical supplies proceeds smoothly and safely thereby contributing to food security and the health of citizens. This document builds on the World Bank Group's Trade and COVID Guidance Note on Managing Risk and Facilitating Trade in the COVID-19 Pandemic which provides recommendations to governments in maintaining the supply chain that are facilitating the trade of critically needed commodities during the COVID-19 pandemic and protecting workers at ports, terminals and points of entry. Addressing the issues will require an array of actions by governments and border agencies. Some can and should be addressed quickly, such as sanitary procedures and social distancing at border posts and portraits Others will require border agencies to undertake procedural and/or amendments to legislation or regulations. The latter may be difficult to implement in the short term but should still be reviewed to address future pandemics and emergency situations. This guidance note provides examples of good practices implemented by countries in response to COVID-19. Where possible, links have been provided for additional information. The note is not intended to identify all the countries implementing such measures, but only to provide some examples of measures that can support governments in dealing with the crisis and improving trade in critical commodities",

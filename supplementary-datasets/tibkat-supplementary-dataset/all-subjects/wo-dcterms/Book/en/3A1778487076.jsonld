            "abstract": "The main aim of this study is to present power plants for all fields of industry. The chapters collected in the book are contributions by invited researchers with long-standing experience in different research areas. I hope that the material presented here is understandable to a wide audience, not only energy and mechanical engineering specialists but also scientists from various disciplines. The book contains seven chapters in two sections: (1) \"\"Power Plants & Technical Details\"\" and (2) \"\"Power Plants in Different Fuels\"\". This book shows detailed and up-to-date evaluations in different areas and was written by academics with experience in their field. It is anticipated that this book will make a scientific contribution to power plant workers, researchers, academics, MSc and PhD students, and other scientists in both the present and future",

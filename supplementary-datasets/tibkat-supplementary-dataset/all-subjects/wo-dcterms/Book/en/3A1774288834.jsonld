            "abstract": "Conditions in the region and the rest of the world have changed dramatically since the April 2020 Regional Economic Update (World Bank 2020a). In addition to still unfolding unprecedented health crisis, the world is now experiencing the deepest global recession since the Second World War (World Bank 2020b). The global economy is projected to contract by 5.2 percent this year, with output in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) shrinking by 2.5 percent-the first contraction in at least sixty years. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant loss of life and has had severe economic effects on the developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region. Many governments have responded to the pandemic-induced shock with sizable fiscal and monetary support. Although subject to significant uncertainty, regional growth is expected to rebound to [6.6 percent] in 2021 as the pandemic subsides, remaining restrictions are lifted, and global demand recovers. The pandemicinduced crisis will likely hit hardest the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities, [putting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) further out of reach]. The dynamics of the shock mean that in 2020 the region will experience the widest output gaps in decades. Absent of sift and effective actions, the pandemic will slow potential growth in the region by weakening investment, human capital, and the supply chains that have been an important conduit for productivity gains over the past decade",

            "title": "Current Topics in Ionizing Radiation Research",
            "abstract": "Since the discovery of X rays by Roentgen in 1895, the ionizing radiation has been extensively utilized in a variety of medical and industrial applications. However people have shortly recognized its harmful aspects through inadvertent uses. Subsequently people experienced nuclear power plant accidents in Chernobyl and Fukushima, which taught us that the risk of ionizing radiation is closely and seriously involved in the modern society. In this circumstance, it becomes increasingly important that more scientists, engineers and students get familiar with ionizing radiation research regardless of the research field they are working. Based on this idea, the book \"\"Current Topics in Ionizing Radiation Research\"\" was designed to overview the recent achievements in ionizing radiation research including biological effects, medical uses and principles of radiation measurement",

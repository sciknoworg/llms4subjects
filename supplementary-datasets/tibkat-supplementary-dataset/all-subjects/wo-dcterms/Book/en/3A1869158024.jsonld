            "abstract": "The funder would like the two following paragraphs to be included in the open access chapter:  \"This open access chapter was developed with support from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Building Technologies Office to include advanced heat pump technologies that are critical to providing heating in buildings powered by renewable energy.

                "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Understanding pollution, its behaviour and impact is becoming increasingly important, as new technologies and legislation continually lower the tolerable levels of pollutants released into the environment. Introduction to Pollution Science draws upon sections of the authors' previous text (Understanding our Environment) and reflects the growing trend of a more sophisticated approach to teaching environmental science at university. This new revised book discusses the basics of environmental pollution drawing upon chemistry, physics and biological sciences. The book, written by leading experts in the field, covers topics including pollution in the atmosphere, the world's waters and soil and land contamination. Subsequent sections discuss methods of investigating the environment, the impact of pollution on human health and ecological systems and institutional mechanisms for pollution management. Each section includes worked examples and questions and is aimed at undergraduates studying environmental science, but will also prove of value to others seeking knowledge of the field",

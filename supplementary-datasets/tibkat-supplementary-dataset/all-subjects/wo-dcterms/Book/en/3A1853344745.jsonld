            "abstract": "History from Loss challenges the common thought that \"\"history is written by the winners\"\" and explores how history-makers in different times and places across the globe have written histories from loss, even when this has come at the threat to their own safety.  A distinguished group of historians from around the globe offer an introduction to different history-makers\u2019 lives and ideas, and important extracts from their works which highlight various meanings of loss: from physical ailments to social ostracism, exile to imprisonment, and from dispossession to potential execution. Throughout the volume consideration of the information \"\"bubbles\"\" of different times and places helps to show how information has been weaponized to cause harm. In this way, the text helps to put current debates about the biases and weaponization of platforms such as social media into global and historical perspectives. In combination, the chapters build a picture of history from loss which is global, sustained, and anything but a simple mirror of history made by victors. The volume also includes an Introduction and Afterword, which draw out the key meanings of history from loss and which offer ideas for further exploration.  History from Loss provides an invaluable resource for students, teachers, and general readers who wish to put current debates on bias, the politicization of history, and threats to history-makers into global and historical perspectives",

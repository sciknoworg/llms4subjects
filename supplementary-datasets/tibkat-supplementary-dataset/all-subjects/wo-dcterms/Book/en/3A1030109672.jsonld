            "abstract": "Swiss citizens approve of their government and the way democracy is practiced; they trust the authorities and are satisfied with the range of services Swiss governments provide. This is quite unusual when compared to other countries. This open access book provides insight into the organization and the functioning of the Swiss state. It claims that, beyond politics, institutions and public administration, there are other factors which make a country successful. The authors argue that Switzerland is an interesting case, from a theoretical, scientific and a more practice-oriented perspective. While confronted with the same challenges as other countries, Switzerland offers different solutions, some of which work astonishingly well. Andreas Ladner is Professor for Political Institutions and Public Administration at the Institut de Hautes \u00c9tudes en Administration Publique (IDHEAP) at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. His research interests include the quality of democracy, political institutions and public administration, local government, political parties and voting advice applications. Nils Soguel is Professor of Public Finance at the Institut de Hautes \u00c9tudes en Administration Publique at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

Yves Emery is Professor for Public Management and Human Resource at the Institut de Hautes \u00c9tudes en Administration Publique at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

Sophie Weerts is Associate Professor of Public Law at the Institut de Hautes \u00c9tudes en Administration Publique at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

St\u00e9phane Nahrath is Professor of Public Policy at the Institut de Hautes \u00c9tudes en Administration Publique at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

            "abstract": "\"A product used to be one part of the customer experience, but for digital enterprises, the product *is* the experience. Product is the new competitive battlefield. Business models increasingly rely on inbound demand and self-service evaluation, which makes the initial product experience key to customer acquisition. This book explains how Product Teams can design a great experience into the product itself. Aspects of sales, marketing, service, support and education--these touchpoints must now converge inside the product. The problem is, much of the software available today doesn't measure up. The result? Users turn up their noses, opting for more elegant and intuitive alternatives, and rejecting or ignoring more than 80 percent of software features. Pendo was the first SaaS company to make software for product managers. They have been committed to equipping and serving product teams with information, thought leadership and best practices since 2013. Their goal has always been to help these product leaders do their jobs better and to advocate for their roles/careers\"--",

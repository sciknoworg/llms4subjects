                "'Dr. Ali's clarity at bringing forth the best of Islamic thinking during its Golden era, coupled with its implications for today's business world is unique and refreshing. In its entirety, this is a book about business ethics, and the need for safeguarding societal interests and preventing fraudulent practices and immoral conduct. I was impressed with the light that Dr. Ali shed on historic Islamic thinking, and contemporary western Corporate Social Responsibility. Dr. Ali's book provides important logic and instruction for those policymakers, and business leaders who seek to avoid another tipping point, or who seek to build institutions that are truly too big to fail.'--Robert L. Lattimer, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, US. 'Professor Abbas Ali's book is a path-breaking and seminal analysis of one of the most contemporary issues in business ethics. It is by far the most thorough and totally comprehensive treatment of the subject. In a meaningful and highly-readable way, this book delineates the thinking of Islamic scholars regarding managerial, organizational, and business ethics and how their perspectives are most germane for creating sound and just ethical systems in multinational corporations and companies. Professor Ali's framework of the book will--without a doubt--increase awareness of the ethical principles of Islam for scholars, executives, and managers. This particular treatise receives my highest recommendation.'--Douglas M. McCabe, Georgetown University, US. Drawing on original sources found in the first century of Islam and guided by contemporary developments in the field of business ethics, this book offers Islamic perspectives on ethical conduct in the marketplace: what organizations and other market actors do to deal with monumental challenges in today's market. The book outlines a framework for business ethics and offers a theory for understanding market ethics. Throughout the book, subjects covered underscore the necessity of ethical conduct and shed light on the interplay of several forces that shape ethical perspectives and morality in the workplace. The book creatively addresses the history and theory of ethics in the marketplace. It also discusses Islamic ethical perspectives in the context of Judaism and Christianity. Likewise, it outlines what companies working in the Muslim environment have to undertake to sustain their competitive advantage. The book, therefore, is of interest to business managers, res ..."

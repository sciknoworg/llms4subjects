            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, As a source of detailed information on the chemistry of food, this book is without equal. It investigates components which are present in large amounts (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals and water) and also those that occur in smaller quantities (pigments, flavours, vitamins and preservatives). The fourth edition has been extensively rewritten to bring it right up to date, with many of the figures also having been redrawn. A number of new topics, many of which will be of particular interest to nutritionists, have been introduced, including modified starches, naturally occurring antioxidants, the health benefits of broccoli, and the production of glucose syrup. Topics of special interest to more advanced students are presented separately, and the structural formulae of around 600 food components are given. This book will be of particular interest to students and teachers of food science and nutrition courses in universities, colleges of further education and schools. Its accessible style also ensures that anyone with an interest in food issues will find it invaluable. Extracts from reviews of 3rd Edition: \"i?? filled me with delight, curiosity and wonder.  All of the chemistry is very clear and thorough. I heartily recommend it.\" The Chemical Educator, October 1997 \"Chemistry comes alive when an expert like Tom Coultate links it to food science i??\" Education in Chemistry, November 1997 Visit www.rsc.org/books/6151 for further information",

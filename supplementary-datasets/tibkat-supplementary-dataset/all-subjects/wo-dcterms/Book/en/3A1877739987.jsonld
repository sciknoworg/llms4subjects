            "abstract": "Nowadays, the technological advances allow developing many applications in different fields. In the book Colorimetry and Image Processing, two important fields are presented: colorimetry and image processing. Colorimetry is observed by a visual interactive programming learning system, an approach based on color analysis of Habanero chili pepper, an approach based on scene image segmentation centered on mathematical morphology, other systems based on the simulations of the dichromatic color appearance, and, finally, an approach based on the color reconstruction in order to enhancement its using super-resolution methods. On the other hand, image processing is shown by pansharpening algorithms for hyperspectral images, an approach based on the analysis of the low-resolution satellite images and ground-based sky camera for estimating the cloud motion, a hybrid super-resolution framework that combines desirable features of TV and PM models, a study of the real-time video analysis used for anthropometric measurements on agricultural tools and machines, and finally, an approach based on the threshold optimization iterative algorithm using the ground truth data and assessing the accuracy of a range of threshold values through the corresponding Kappa coefficient of concordance",

            "abstract": "CMOS Current Amplifiers presents design strategies for high performance current amplifiers based on CMOS technology. After an introduction to various architectures of operational amplifiers, the operating principles of the current amplifier are outlined. This book provides the reader with simple and compact design equations for use in a pencil and paper design and the following simulation step. Chapter 1 introduces the general aspects of current amplifiers. After a preliminary classification of operational amplifiers, ideal blocks and models are discussed for different architectures and a first high-level comparison is made between traditional amplifiers and current amplifiers. Analysis and examples of basic circuits, as well as signal processing applications involving current amplifiers, are also given. Non-idealities and second- order effects causing limitations in performance are then discussed and evaluated. Chapter 2 focuses on low-drive current amplifiers. Several design examples for current conveyors and class A current amplifiers are discussed in detail and design equations are presented for the main performance parameters, which allows a good trade-off between requirements. High-performance solutions for high bandwidth and low voltage capability are also considered, and, finally, current comparators with progressively enhanced performance are reported and analyzed critically. Chapter 3 deals with current amplifiers for off-chip loads. Several class AB current-mode output stages are discussed and design strategies which improve performance are presented. A detailed analysis of non-ideal effect is carried out with particular emphasis on linearity. Design examples are given and circuit arrangements for further developments are included. CMOS Current Amplifiers serves as an excellent reference for researchers and professionals of analog IC design, and may also be used as an advanced text on current amplifiers",

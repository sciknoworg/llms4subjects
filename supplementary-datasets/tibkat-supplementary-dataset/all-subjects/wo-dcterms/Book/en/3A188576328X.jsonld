            "abstract": "Accessible and interdisciplinary in nature, this volume highlights the connections between media, tourism and place, bringing together the diverse perspectives, approaches and actors involved in critical issues relating to media tourism worldwide.  This book explores new avenues, adopting a global and transnational perspective and placing emphasis on the exploration, analysis and comparison of cases from around the world. Encompassing chapters from a plethora of experts, the volume discusses processes and relationships of power involved in the development and experience of media tourism. This book seeks to broaden the horizons of both the reader and existing academic research into media tourism by including research into, among other topics, Bollywood and Nollywood films, Brazilian telenovelas and South Korean K-pop culture. Illustrated with tables and figures throughout, the volume presents insights from a variety of strands of cutting-edge and empirically rich research, which are collated, compared and contrasted to demonstrate the connections between media, tourism and place around the world.  International in scope, this book is an ideal companion for academics and scholars within a wide array of disciplines, such as media studies, tourism studies, fan studies, cultural geography and sociology, as well as those with an interest in media tourism more specifically.

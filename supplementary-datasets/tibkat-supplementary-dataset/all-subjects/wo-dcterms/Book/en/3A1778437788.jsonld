            "title": "Promoting Healthy and Supportive Acoustic Environments: Going beyond the Quietness",
            "abstract": "This book gathers 14 original contributions published in an IJERPH Special Issue that deal with the perception of environmental sounds and how such sounds are likely to affect human quality of life and well-being and the experience of a place. The research focus over the years has been gradually shifting from treating sound simply as \u201cnoise\u201d and something that cities should get rid of to a potential \u201cresource\u201d to promote and support community life in public spaces. Three main topics or \u201cneeds\u201d to be addressed by researchers and practitioners emerged from this Special Issue: (1) the need to re-think \u201cquietness\u201d in cities as something that goes beyond the mere \u201cpursuit of silence\u201d, (2) the need to integrate additional contextual factors in the characterization and management of urban acoustic environments for public health, and (3) the need to consider the acoustic quality of indoor spaces as opposed to an outdoor-only perspective. The contributions collected in this book will hopefully trigger new questions and inform the agenda of future researchers and practitioners in the environmental acoustics domain",

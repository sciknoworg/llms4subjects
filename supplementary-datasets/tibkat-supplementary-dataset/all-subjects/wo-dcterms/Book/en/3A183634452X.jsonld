            "title": "Chapter 8 Not seeing Auschwitz : Memory, generation and representations of the Holocaust in twenty-first century French comics",
            "abstract": "We are reaching a point in history when the generation who experienced the Holocaust as survivors, witnesses or exiles will soon disappear. What happens to our relationship to such a momentous event in global history when our living connection with such a past is broken? To answer this question, this article will explore recent French representations of the Holocaust through the comic book. It will approach such representations from the perspective of the grandchildren of those who were affected by the Holocaust, perhaps the last generation to have personal ties to this wartime past. It will focus specifically on J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Dres\u2019s Nous n\u2019irons pas voir Auschwitz (2011), translated as We Won\u2019t Go and See Auschwitz. As a \u201cthird generation\u201d narrative, Dres\u2019s work is attentive to stories of Jewish exile and loss to be found on the margins of Holocaust histories. This perspective translates into an openness towards transnational histories of the Holocaust; a recognition of place as a substitute for living memory and an awareness of comics\u2019 potential to innovate in the transmission of Holocaust memories. Ultimately, this article will argue that the contemporary comic book acts as a privileged vehicle of remembrance, indicative of the reordering of Holocaust representations in an age of cultural memory",

            "abstract": "Rural development is an essential constituent of the global economy. However, within agriculture, a decrease in the quantity and quality of crop harvest and livestock productivity is observed due to a deterioration in soil fertility, environment, and irrational use of natural resources. At the same time, agricultural areas are under pressure from population growth, requiring more food production. As a result, it encourages people to move into intact primary areas in order to increase the area of crops, pastures, etc., which leads to the destruction of natural diversity. The solution to avoid disaster is increasing agricultural production efficiency to expand crop harvest and livestock productivity without deteriorating quality. It requires introducing innovative engineering technologies to agriculture. Fortunately, technology is developing rapidly nowadays, and new driving scientific forces are emerging. The Special Issue collected high-quality research and review articles from academics and industry-related researchers in the areas of Agricultural Engineering covering the following topics: harvesting and planting crops, livestock production, livestock and agrofood waste utilization, seed treatment and transportation, water treatment, agricultural robotic applications, solutions for digital and precision agriculture, hardware and software support for pest and weed control, machine learning, energy efficiency and conservation in agriculture",

            "abstract": "Atopological Trilogy creates new concepts for Deleuze-Guattarian thought without any heed for sectarian, sermonising, or dutiful readings of the philosophers. In Part I of the trilogy, \u201cBecoming-Sexual of the Sexual,\u201d Aracag\u00f6k demonstrates the ways in which quantum theory and the concept of \u201ccomplementarity\u201d inform Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s thought, especially in relation to \u201cbecoming\u201d in general and \u201cbecoming-woman\u201d and \u201cbecoming-queer\u201d more particularly. Aracag\u00f6k argues that the ways in which the philosophers put forward a ban on \u201cbecoming-man\u201d with a certain degree of undecidability encapsulates (albeit in a cryptic form) other becomings, the most important of which is becoming-queer, or rather, the becoming-sexual of the sexual.  In Part II: \u201cDeleuze on Sound, Music, and Schizo-Incest,\u201d Aracag\u00f6k puts into resonance the sound, noise, and music (and the question) of schizo-incest with the intention of deterritorialising a notion of the meta-audible. If Kafka\u2019s story, \u201cThe Investigations of a Dog\u201d leads us to a realm of the \u201cformless\u201d which cannot be heard without destroying what we know as \u201chearing,\u201d it also offers us a limit-experience of the meta-audible, which, when radicalised via the notions of \u201cschizo-incest\u201d and \u201cself-shattering,\u201d creates a line of flight that escapes even from the line of flight itself. All these maneuvers pose a serious challenge to Deleuze and Guattari, who claim that despite all his investigations, Kafka\u2019s investigator dog is re-Oedipalised in the end. Proposing in the end a limit experience which Aracag\u00f6k calls the \u201cmeta-audible,\u201d he shows that Kafka\u2019s more radical approach to sound creates a line of flight that escapes even from the line of flight itself",

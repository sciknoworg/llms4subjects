            "abstract": "This book explores the first encounters between Samoans and Europeans up to the arrival of the missionaries, using all available sources for the years 1722 to the 1830s, paying special attention to the first encounter on land with the Lap\u00e9rouse expedition. Many of the sources used are French, and some of difficult accessibility, and thus they have not previously been thoroughly examined by historians. Adding some Polynesian comparisons from beyond Samoa, and reconsidering the so-called \u2018Sahlins-Obeyesekere debate\u2019 about the fate of Captain Cook, \u2018First Contacts\u2019 in Polynesia advances a hypothesis about the contemporary interpretations made by the Polynesians of the nature of the Europeans, and about the actions that the Polynesians devised for this encounter: wrapping Europeans up in \u2018cloth\u2019 and presenting \u2018young girls\u2019 for \u2018sexual contact\u2019. It also discusses how we can go back two centuries and attempt to reconstitute, even if only partially, the point of view of those who had to discover for themselves these Europeans whom they call \u2018Papalagi\u2019. The book also contributes an additional dimension to the much-touted \u2018Mead-Freeman debate\u2019 which bears on the rules and values regulating adolescent sexuality in \u2018Samoan culture\u2019. Scholars have long considered the pre-missionary times as a period in which freedom in sexuality for adolescents predominated. It appears now that this erroneous view emerged from a deep misinterpretation of Lap\u00e9rouse\u2019s and Dumont d\u2019Urville\u2019s narratives",

            "abstract": "Laureate universities offer higher education degrees in the Mexican context, an environment where there is a significant, unmet demand for college degrees and yet, private universities face a highly competitive market to expand their services. This study is an ex-post impact evaluation. Namely, it was planned and implemented, years after the individuals participating in this study enrolled and graduated from college, cancelling the possibility of having baseline information available. Thus, the study relies on data collected directly from the field, including a college graduate's survey, an employer's survey, and in-depth interviews to Laureate former students. The analysis is based on a quasi-experimental approach for an impact evaluation, complemented with descriptive statistics and qualitative information. The outcome results assessed in this report can be grouped into three categories: a) economic capital and employment, which refers to various aspects of the alumni's professional career and income generation after graduation; b) career advancement, which measures ability to be promoted and access to managerial positions, and c) social progress, which captures the change in an individual's position within a power hierarchy via occupational prestige and the change in socioeconomic levels during shorter periods of time (as opposed to an intergenerational change)",

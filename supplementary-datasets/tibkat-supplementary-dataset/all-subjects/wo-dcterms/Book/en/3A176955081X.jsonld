            "abstract": "This book presents the new approach of resource-driven bamboo construction (RDBC), developing a clear assessment framework and operational solution to improve the value of resources and the sustainability of bamboo constructions. The book discusses how to carry out research on basic parameters and life cycle assessment, as well demonstrating the approach in practice. This book develops a sustainability assessment model for bamboo construction in Asia-Pacific bamboo areas to measure the effects and success of RDBC. It solves issues related to environmental impact, energy consumption, land cost, indoor comfort, construction durability, and sustainable material application of the bamboo constructions. It utilizes digital tools to perform statistical analysis on large sample conditions, enabling the method to be better implemented, and presents case studies of RDBC method in action. The large amount of data collected, method guidance, and demonstrations provide a comprehensive reference for those wishing to apply bamboo in the building industry. This book is particularly relevant to scientists, professionals, architects, civil engineers, and students who are interested in bamboo material and its application in building industry. It provides readers with a new perspective of the high-value utilization of bamboo forest resources and methods to achieve sustainable bamboo construction.",

            "title": "Voices to Choices : Bangladesh's Journey in Women's Economic Empowerment",
            "abstract": "Women have experienced significant changes in various spheres of their lives during the last decades as Bangladesh made economic progress. Yet women's economic engagement and empowerment are subdued, as they cannot make sufficient choices for themselves. This book provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic developments in gender equality in Bangladesh. Through examining women's participation in the labour force, ownership and control of household assets, use and control of financial assets, and opportunities for entrepreneurship, the authors have made concrete recommendations to overcome challenges that lie ahead for women's economic empowerment. This book is an important contribution to the knowledge on interventions required by the policy makers and broader stakeholders towards narrowing gender gaps. --Fahmida Khatun, PhD, Executive Director, Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), BangladeshThe women's story is central to Bangladesh's economic and social transformation. There is an urgent need to deepen researched understanding of the multidimensional pathways of women's economic empowerment and extent of real progress made. Voices to Choices is an important contribution to this story. Surely, the journey of women's economic empowerment remains a long and challenging one. Realizing the full benefits of new opportunities is often hampered by both new and entrenched insecurities. The task is as much one of empowering women's agency as of dismantling barriers. The responsibility is as much women's as society's. --Hossain Zillur Rahman, PhD, Executive Chairman, Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC)This book provides critical insights and is timely, as it outlines how girls and women in Bangladesh have gained more opportunities in labor force participation, control over household and financial assets, as well as greater prospects for entrepreneurship. The findings will greatly contribute to future policy and planning for government and key stakeholders working to advance women's economic empowerment in the country. --Sabina Faiz Rashid, PhD, Dean and Professor, BRAC James P.

            "abstract": "Floor 26 of Ho King Commercial Centre in Yau Ma Tei, the elevator stops. At the end of the corridor, the sound of a heavy metal band, detuned screams buffered by the cracked plywood door of a tiny music studio. Outdated factory buildings in Kwun Tong, industrial architecture gradually surrounded by new commercial and residential complexes; their precarious wait for urban renewal has offered an opportunity for young musicians to establish music studios, classrooms, or improvised bedrooms where music and teenage discoveries mingle with the noise of machinery. A rusty anonymous intercom partially hidden by some plastic ivies. Past the door, a narrow metallic staircase, source of random encounters and only access point to a one-off experience; hundreds of people\u2014local and foreigners\u2014gathered in a tiny dark room, a miscellany of sweat, smoke, voices, and distant music. The hidden networks formed by musicians scattered in unexpected venues around Hong Kong provide a sonic collage that reformulates some of the city\u2019s social peripheries from within. Through emergent sub-cultures, young artists deploy a wide range of tactics to counter the commodification and politicization of creativity, and the speculation over space in order to achieve new opportunities in a \u201cbureaucratic society of controlled consumption.\u201d In his work on everyday life, which focuses on the resistance of (extra)ordinary people to structures of power, Michel de Certeau makes reference to the idea of \u201csilent discoverers of their own paths in the jungle of functionalist rationality.\u201d The main actors of this essay, despite feeding on and actively participating in Hong Kong\u2019s consumerism dynamics by taking references from social media, e-commerce, or shopping malls, produce \u201cwandering lines\u201d\u2014or wandering sounds\u2014with their own (syn)tactics through their artistic practices. Notably, in Hong Kong\u2019s reductionist bureaucratic system, with a strong predominance of statistics and evaluation focused on \u201cclassifying, calculating and putting into tables,\u201d these artistic rituals and reinterpretations of the city\u2019s culture often remain overlooked or hidden to the system",

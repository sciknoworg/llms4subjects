            "abstract": "In nearly all process industries, crystallization is used at some stage as a method of production, purification or recovery of solid materials. In recent years, a number of new applications have also come to rely on crystallization processes such as the crystallization of nano and amorphous materials. The articles in this book have been contributed by some of the most respected researchers in this area and cover the frontier areas of research and developments in crystallization processes. Divided into three sections, this book provides the latest research developments in many aspects of crystallization including the crystallization of biological macromolecules and pharmaceutical compounds, the crystallization of nanomaterials and the crystallization of amorphous and glassy materials. This book is of interest to both fundamental research and practicing scientists and will prove invaluable to all chemical engineers and industrial chemists in process industries, as well as crystallization workers and students in industry and academia",

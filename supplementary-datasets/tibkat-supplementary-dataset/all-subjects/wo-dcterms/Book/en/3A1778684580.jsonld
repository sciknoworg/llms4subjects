Our goal with this book was to dissect Herpesviridae into its biological properties and clinical significance in order to provide a logical, as well as practical, approach to understanding and treating the various conditions caused by this unique family of viruses. In addition to their up-to-date and extensive text, each chapter is laced with a variety of diagrams, tables, charts, and images, aimed at helping us achieve our goal. We hope that this book will serve as a reference tool for clinicians of various specialties worldwide",

                "Improve your odds of passing one of the most highly sought-after exams for developers working with Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform: Exam AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure. This book guides you through practical examples of each of the technologies covered by the exam while exposing you to the settings and interactions between platform solutions that you will need to be in command of to prepare for the exam and to use on your job in Azure development. Chapters in this book correspond directly to the exam skills outline and are delivered in a \u201cfrom-the-ground-up\u201d approach, allowing you to build your knowledge as you go. This approach serves to help even novice developers get up to speed quickly, while allowing more experienced developers to find the exact topics and scenarios they need to hone their skill sets as they both prepare for the exam and reference information for real-world solutions. As you work through each chapter, you will get an introduction to the topic of the chapter followed by a comprehensive discovery of the key elements of the Azure service(s) being covered. You\u2019ll be guided through solutions by studying typical, real-world scenarios. Each chapter concludes with review questions to solidify your learning and includes links to the corresponding Microsoft Learn modules that are relevant to the concepts in the chapter and associated with each section of the AZ-204 exam. What You Will Learn Know the essential platform services of Azure Develop and deploy secure and robust web solutions Architect and create serverless solutions Manage containers in the Azure Containers ecosystem Choose the correct messaging and event-handling tools for your applications Master real-world examples and challenges that help prepare you for the AZ-204 exam."

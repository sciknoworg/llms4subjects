            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, With an emphasis on co-ordination compounds, d- and f-Block Chemistry aims to provide an introduction to the principles underlying the chemistry of the d- and f-block metals. It briefly describes the origins, uses and importance of these elements before considering the factors underlying their chemical properties. The book describes aspects of structure, bonding, chemical thermodynamics and spectroscopy, which underpin studies of the chemistry of these elements. Examples are drawn from different parts of the d- or f-blocks to illustrate particular points and study questions allow students to practice the application of the principles they have learned. The text assumes a basic knowledge of symmetry, atomic structure, thermodynamics and electrode potentials. A familiarity with the qualitative use of the molecular orbital approach to bonding is also assumed, although an understanding of group theory is not essential. The material is aimed at first and second year undergraduates, with a view to providing a basis for more advanced studies of the reactions, electronic structures, spectra and magnetism of transition metal complexes. Additional material is available on the website at www.rsc.  org/tct Ideal for the needs of undergraduate chemistry students, Tutorial Chemistry Texts is a major series consisting of short, single topic or modular texts concentrating on the fundamental areas of chemistry taught in undergraduate science courses. Each book provides a concise account of the basic principles underlying a given subject, embodying an independent-learning philosophy and including worked examples",

            "abstract": "The book contains data on development of the technologies based on the use of non-stationary electric discharges in plasma jets. Formation of a plasma jet takes place under the effect of non-stationary detonation waves propagating between electrode units. In this case the energy parameters of the plasma can be controlled by a fuel mixture composition, electric potential and geometric characteristics of a device. As a result of interaction with plasma, the treated surface is subjected to pulsed electromagnetic, thermal and elastic-deformation influence. The results of studies of modified layers subjected to pulse plasma treatment are presented.  The book describes technologies and equipment that are commercially applied for modification of working surfaces of machine parts and tools. Examples of application of the technologies in metallurgy, mining industry, wood working, machine building and other industrial sectors are given.  For engineering and technical workers of machine-building enterprises and institutions specializing in the field of hardening processing of products",

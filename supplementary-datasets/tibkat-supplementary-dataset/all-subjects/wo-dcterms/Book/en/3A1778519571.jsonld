            "abstract": "The rapid development and growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a remote sensing platform, as well as advances in the miniaturization of instrumentation and data systems, have resulted in an increasing uptake of this technology in the environmental and remote sensing science communities. Although tough regulations across the globe may still limit the broader use of UAVs, their use in precision agriculture, ecology, atmospheric research, disaster response biosecurity, ecological and reef monitoring, forestry, fire monitoring, quick response measurements for emergency disaster, Earth science research, volcanic gas sampling, monitoring of gas pipelines, mining plumes, humanitarian observations and biological/chemo-sensing tasks continues to increase. This book provides a forum for high-quality peer-reviewed papers that broaden the awareness and understanding of UAV developments, applications of UAVs for remote sensing, and associated developments in sensor technology, data processing and communications, and UAV system design and sensing capabilities. The book covers the following topics: \u2022 improvements in UAV sensor technology; \u2022 UAV sensor design; \u2022 descriptions of processing algorithms applied to UAV-based imagery datasets; \u2022 the use of optical, multi-spectral, hyperspectral, laser, and optical SAR technologies onboard UAVs; \u2022 Artificial intelligence and data mining-based strategies from UAV-acquired datasets; \u2022 UAV onboard data storage, transmission, and retrieval; \u2022 multiple platform UAV, AUV, and ground robot networks; \u2022 UAV sensor applications including: precision agriculture, construction, mining, pest detection, forestry, wildlife tracking, atmosphere, wildfire monitoring and prevention, reef monitoring, Earth science research pollution monitoring, micro-climates, land use precision agriculture, ecology, atmospheric research, quick response measurements for emergency disaster",

            "abstract": "Parasitology is an established discipline that covers a wide area of subjects, ranging from the basics (study of life cycle, ecology, epidemiology, taxonomy, biodiversity, etc) to the advanced and applied aspects (human and animal related, although control aspect remains the most important task). There is a great scarcity in the amount of available literature that is freely accessible to anyone interested in the subject. This book was conceptualized with this in mind. The entire book is based on the findings of various studies performed by different authors, comprising reviews and original scientific papers. I hope this book will be helpful to diverse audiences like biologists, zoologists, nematologists, parasitologists, microbiologists, medical doctors, pathologists as well as the molecular biologists, by providing them with a better understanding of the subject",

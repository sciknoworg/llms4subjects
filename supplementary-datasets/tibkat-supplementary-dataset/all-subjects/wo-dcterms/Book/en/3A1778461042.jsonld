            "title": "Applications of Photogrammetry for Environmental Research",
            "abstract": "The book presents a collection of papers focused on recent progress in key areas of photogrammetry for environmental research. Applications oriented to the understanding of natural phenomena and quantitative processes using dataset from photogrammetry (from satellite to unmanned aerial vehicle images) and terrestrial laser scanning, also by a diachronic approach, are reported. The book covers topics of interest of many disciplines from geography, geomorphology, engineering geology, geotechnology, including landscape description and coastal studies. Mains issues faced by the book are related to applications on coastal monitoring, using multitemporal aerial images, and investigations on geomorphological hazard by the joint use of proximal photogrammetry, terrestrial and aerial laser scanning aimed to the reconstruction of detailed surface topography and successive 2D/3D numerical simulations for rock slope stability analyses. Results reported in the book bring into evidence the fundamental role of multitemporal surveys and reliable reconstruction of morphologies from photogrammetry and laser scanning as support to environmental researches",

                "This book collects the scientific proceedings presented during the \"2023 The 3rd International Civil Engineering and Architecture Conference\u201d held in Kyoto in March 2023 with the aim of showing the latest advancements in theoretical and applied research in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector. Worldwide, the growing demand is for green and smart buildings that are perfectly integrated into the surrounding environment, have efficient energy and resource consumption, use environmentally friendly materials and renewable energies, favor recycling and reuse, and offer improved indoor comfort and air quality. The book provides readers with an overview of the ongoing transformation of the AEC industry presenting a thorough investigation of the emerging trends and challenges in the fields of green building design, construction and operation. Its content caters to researchers, engineers and architects working in the field of theoretical, experimental and practical civil engineering and architecture.",

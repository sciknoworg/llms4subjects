                "This open-access-book synthesizes a supportive developer checklist considering sustainable Team and agile Project Management in the challenge of Artificial Intelligence and limits of image recognition. The study bases on technical, ethical, and legal requirements with examples concerning autonomous vehicles. As the first of its kind, it analyzes all reported car accidents state wide (1.28 million) over a 10-year period. Integrating of highly sensitive international court rulings and growing consumer expectations make this book a helpful guide for product and team development from initial concept until market launch. The author Thomas Winkle (Prof. Dr.-Ing., MBA Communication & Leadership) is a multiple author in best-selling Springer books such as \u201cAutonomous Driving: Technical, Legal and Social Aspects\u201d or the \u201cHandbook of Driver Assistance Systems\u201d. His work bases on three decades in sustainable team consulting as employee and researcher in the legal departments of three car manufacturers as well as a professor at IU International University and TU Munich.

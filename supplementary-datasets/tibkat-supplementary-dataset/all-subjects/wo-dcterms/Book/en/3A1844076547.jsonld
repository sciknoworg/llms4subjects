The book brings together collected empirical evidence and pilot innovative research projects run by the author team that illustrate functional abilities, application potential and challenges of Industry 4.0 key enabling technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, neural networks, blockchain, nanotechnology, etc.) and provides useful applied recommendations on managing the risks of their use in order to achieve economic growth fairly across society in the developed and developing countries. It presents suggestions to improve national legislation and existing economic regulations, which would also ensure boosting scientific research and training highly qualified personnel in computer, economic, administrative, legal and social sciences at the advanced universities and research institutions in the Post-Soviet area."

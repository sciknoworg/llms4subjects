            "abstract": "This book recounts the immigration experience of a prominent Minneapolis lawyer who served as a local elected official (Judge of Probate) and led an active civic life. Ueland was originally a Norwegian from the Stavanger region. Son of a farmer and politician, he recalls many of the folk customs of his native village community. He left for America in 1871 in late adolescence and traveled west by train. While learning English, he supported himself by working in saw-mills, lumber-yards, and on farms as an agricultural laborer. In those early years, he lived in Rushford and Farmington as well as Minneapolis. Ueland's legal practice developed from his activities as a middleman and mediator between Norwegian-Americans and the larger American community. He was an avid participant in literary and fine arts societies, maintaining interest in ethnic matters and becoming increasingly involved with the city at large. Ueland also spends several chapters discussing Lutheran doctrine and church controversies. He concludes with his return visit to the land of his birth",

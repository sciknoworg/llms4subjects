COVID-19 unified the international response to human suffering, and the world has a lot to learn about the initiatives implemented in India since its independence. This open-access book covers the conceptualization, design, and impact of notable social welfare programs in India. The Future of India's Social Safety Nets combines insights from social protection, economic development, and social policy. It covers India\u2019s social development in terms of three essential aspects of policy design: focus (intended beneficiaries), form (transfer modalities), and scope (developmental objectives). Highlighting developmental achievements and shortcomings, this book proposes a framework to foster human resilience through social protection.

Prabhu Pingali is Professor of Applied Economics and Founding Director of the Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition at Cornell University.",

                "This volume provides detailed protocols for the isolation, enumeration, characterization of diverse bacteriophages, including both small to jumbo bacteriophages, from soil, fecal, municipal wastewater, and from food niche samples. Chapters highlight the diversity of bacteriophages in different environments, quantifications using culture, molecular techniques, protocols for isolate, interaction of bacteriophage proteins with host cells, and how to use bacteriophages to transfer foreign genetic elements to bacterial strains. In addition to the above, chapters feature the application of bacteriophages/bacteriophage-derived products. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips (in the Notes section) on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and cutting-edge, Bacteriophages: Methods and Protocols aims to ensure successful results in further study of this vital field.",

            "abstract": "South Africa's ambition is to build a more inclusive, resilient and sustainable economy. This ambition depends on the extent to which the country is able to shift from its heavy dependence on coal to low-carbon activities and to address the growing risks presented by climate change. This low-carbon path and adaptation must be people-centered, creating jobs and protecting the poorest in the most unequal society in the world. All of these require policies and actions with inevitable tradeoffs and some synergies. The South Africa Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) provides analysis and recommendations on integrating the country's efforts to achieve rapid growth, higher employment and lower inequality with the pursuit of a low-carbon and climate resilient development path. The CCDR provides a summary of key challenges and opportunities for the country's transition to a low-carbon economy in a just way. The report also provides assessment of what it takes (in terms of technical, financial and institutional and governance framework) for South Africa to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 without undermining its development ambitions. The report examines ways in which South Africa could adapt and build resilience to a changing climate. Finally, the report provides priority packages of policy recommendations that South Africa could implement to achieve its just transition to a low-carbon economy and society by 2050",

Based on clinical evidence, international guidelines and experts experience, practical clinical management strategies are presented for each condition. Each clinical care pathway is based on updated algorithm, level of evidence, photos and video-clips that describes the clinical presentations and the best practice management through diagnostic tools and medical or surgical treatment. Leading experts from the most important center of excellence in the field of sexual medicine joined to cover the field of andrology in its entirety, each of them dealing with a single topic from the top of their recognized experience and providing a complete and update textbook that will help urologists and other physicians in their daily clinical practice.

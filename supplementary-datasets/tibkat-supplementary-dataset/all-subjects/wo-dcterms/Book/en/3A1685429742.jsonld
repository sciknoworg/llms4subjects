            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, As a textbook, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology has always been immensely popular. Now in its fourth edition, it has been completely revised and updated to provide a comprehensive overview and to reflect all the latest developments in this rapidly expanding area. Written by recognised experts, the book aims to identify the impact that molecular biology has had on the development of biotechnology, with each of the nineteen chapters describing a specific subject area relevant to the subject. The impressive breadth of coverage includes areas such as plant biotechnology; food technology; vaccine development; the production of transgenic plants and animals; and the addition of an appropriate and timely new chapter devoted to bioinformatics. Presenting information in an easily assimilated form, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology makes an ideal undergraduate text. It will be of particular interest to students of biology and chemistry, as well as to scientists from outside the field requiring a rapid introduction to the subject",

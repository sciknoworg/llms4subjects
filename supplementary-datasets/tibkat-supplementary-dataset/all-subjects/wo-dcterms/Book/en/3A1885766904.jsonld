            "abstract": "Archaeology has everything to do with the past, but it also concerns the present. The way contemporary societies perceive the material world influences how archaeologists approach different phenomena identified in the material record. This influence may lead to biases and restricted scientific fields oriented towards established paradigms and discourses, rather than questioning how such discourses and modes of thought developed. This volume focuses on describing how archaeologists have perceived and presented the Bronze Age to the general public especially in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. The research makes use of the concepts of Subsistence Paradigm and Landscapes as Resources to propose alternative approaches for understanding mobility and interactions during the Bronze Age in the Middle and Low Guadalquivir Valley (Spain). The goal is to move beyond traditional models that reproduce power relationships, predatory use of materials and violence, not only in the field of Archaeology but in society as a whole",

            "title": "The Wealth of the Unemployed : Adequacy and Implications for Unemployment Insurance",
            "abstract": "While there has been considerable discussion of the adequacy of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits as a form of income replacement, there is little evidence on the other resources that the unemployed have to finance their unemployment spells.  In this paper I focus on focus on one form of resources, own wealth holdings. I find that the median worker has financial assets sufficient to finance roughly two-thirds of the income loss from an unemployment spell, but that there is tremendous heterogeneity in wealth holdings; almost one-third of workers can't even replace 10% of their income loss.  Most strikingly, ex-ante wealth holdings decline precipitously with realized unemployment durations, both absolutely and (especially) relative to ex-post income loss, suggesting that adequacy could be increased if UI benefits were targeted to those with longer spells.  I also find strong evidence that individuals who are eligible for more generous UI draw down their wealth more slowly during unemployment spells.  This demonstrates that wealth is used as a consumption smoothing device alongside UI to cope with the income loss from unemployment",

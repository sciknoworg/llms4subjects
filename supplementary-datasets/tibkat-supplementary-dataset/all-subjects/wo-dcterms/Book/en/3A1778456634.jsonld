            "abstract": "Imaging and analysis are widely involved in various research fields, including biomedical applications, medical imaging and diagnosis, computer vision, autonomous driving, and robot controls. Imaging and analysis are now facing big changes regarding intelligence, due to the breakthroughs of artificial intelligence techniques, including deep learning. Many difficulties in image generation, reconstruction, de-noising skills, artifact removal, segmentation, detection, and control tasks are being overcome with the help of advanced artificial intelligence approaches. This Special Issue focuses on the latest developments of learning-based intelligent imaging techniques and subsequent analyses, which include photographic imaging, medical imaging, detection, segmentation, medical diagnosis, computer vision, and vision-based robot control. These latest technological developments will be shared through this Special Issue for the various researchers who are involved with imaging itself, or are using image data and analysis for their own specific purposes",

                "It is in the area of Systems Diagnosis. Supervision and Control that Knowledge-Based Techniques have had their most significant impact in recent years. In this volume. Spyros Tzafestas has ably put together the current state of the art of the application of Artificial Intelligence concepts to problems of Systems Diagnosis. All the authors in this edited work are distinguished internationally. recognized experts on various aspects of Artificial Intelligence and its applications. and the coverage of the field that they provide is both readable and authoritative. The sixteen chapters break down in a natural way into three broad categories i.e \u2022\u2022 (a) introduction to the applications of Expert Systems in Engineering. (b) Knowledge-based systems architectures. models and techniques for fault diagnosis. supervision and real time control and finally. (c) applications and case studies in three specific 'areas. namely: Manufacturing. Chemical Processes and Communications Networks. The final chapter provides a com\u00ad prehensive survey of the field with an extensive bibliography. The mix of original scientific articles. tutorial and survey papers makes this col\u00ad lection a very timely and valuable addition to the literature in this important field. MADAN G. SINGH Professor of Information Engineering at U.M.I.S.T."

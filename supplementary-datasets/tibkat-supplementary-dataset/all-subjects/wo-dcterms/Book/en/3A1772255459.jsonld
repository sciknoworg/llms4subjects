                "\u201cMigration and Integration Challenges of Muslim Immigrants in Europe: Debating Policies and Cultural Approaches\u201d sheds new light on the complexity involved in the variegated and multifaceted migration interactions between Europe and the Muslim world. It does so by drawing on a rich selection of migration relationships, which greatly add to the existing knowledge about one of the most relevant and debated migration connections of our time. \u2013 Joaqu\u00edn Arango, Professor of Sociology, Complutense University Madrid, Spain As the impetus of globalization continues to gather pace, more and more people leave their homes pursuing dreams of a better life for themselves and their families. Muslim immigrants converging on Europe from widely divergent communities scattered throughout North Africa, the Middle East and South-East Asia, represent a great variety of local cultures and traditions. Trans-Mediterranean networks form the basis of migration routes and are key factors in the destinations of these migrants and in the overall process of immigration, be this towards Europe or other Muslim countries. South-North fluxes intertwine with South-South fluxes, among which the Gulf Arab countries stand out as a prime destination, not only for low-skilled labour. Different situations emerge, within a variegated discourse on co-existence, integration, assimilation and the preservation of identity. The adoption of this transnational dimension incorporating both destination, and points of origin, enables the investigation of migration to move beyond a purely Eurocentric approach. Thus, different national patterns are analyzed with a focus on a number of significant case-studies. By debating policies and cultural approaches the aim is to add innovative scholarship to the challenge of integration. Cross-cultural pluralism on the part of the nation states comprising the European Union is one avenue for moving the dialogue between different cultural frameworks towards a more compatible form. Annemarie Profanter is Professor of Intercultural Pedagogy at the Faculty of Education of the Free University of Bolzano (unibz), Italy.

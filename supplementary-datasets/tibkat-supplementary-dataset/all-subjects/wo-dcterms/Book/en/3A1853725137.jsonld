            "abstract": "\"Taking a strategic imperative perspective, this book introduces business leaders to a key differentiator that contributes to competitive advantage and financial sustainability: cultural competence. In a fast changing and globalized world where organizations are being forced to rethink their strategies, understanding present and future environmental, social, and economic challenges is fundamental to creating a resilient and value-creating business. Combining experience and reflection, this book addresses concepts of organizational cultural competence as an internal differentiator and source of competitive advantage. Most organizations approach differentiation as an external feature of product and/or service delivery. Whereas these are open to imitation, cultural competence, as the internal DNA of an organization, is much more difficult, if not impossible, to imitate. The authors bring to bear their years of experience in corporate roles and as entrepreneurs and academics, sharing views and experiences based on research but also on primary examples, meta-insights, and real-world case studies. Senior leaders and consultants across industries, as well as students of strategy and leadership development, will value this serious and comprehensive guide that explains the importance of cultural competence as a strategic advantage in a global market\"--",

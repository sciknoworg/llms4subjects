            "abstract": "This study consists of two parts. The first part offers an overview of feminism\u2019s theory of differences. The second part deals with the textual analysis of poems about \u2018mothering\u2019 by women from India, the Caribbean and Africa. Literary criticism has dealt with the representation of \u2018mothering\u2019 in prose texts. The exploration of lyrical texts has not yet come. Since the late 1970s, the acknowledgement of and the commitment to difference has been foundational for feminist theory and activism. This investigation promotes a differentiated, \u2018locational\u2019 feminism (Friedman). The comprehensive theoretical discussion of feminism\u2019s different concepts of \u2018gender\u2019, \u2018race\u2019, \u2018ethnicity\u2019 and \u2018mothering\u2019 builds the foundation for the main part: the presentation and analysis of the poems. The issue of \u2018mothering\u2019 foregrounds the communicative aspect of women\u2019s experience and wants to bridge the gap between theory and practice. This study, however, does not intend to specify \u2018mothering\u2019 as a universal and unique feminine characteristic. It underlines a metaphorical use and discusses the concepts of \u2018nurturing\u2019, \u2018maternal practice\u2019 and \u2018social parenthood\u2019. Regarding the extensive material, this study understands itself as an explorative not concluding investigation placed at the intersections of gender studies, postcolonial and classical literary studies. Most of all, it aims at initiating a dialogue and interchange between scholars and students in the Western and the \u2018Third World\u2019",

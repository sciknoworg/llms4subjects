            "title": "Rwanda Economic Update, November 2011 : Resilience in the Face of Economic Adversity",
            "abstract": "Rwanda is expected to grow at over 8 percent in 2011, led by strong growth in the agricultural, industrial, and services sectors in the second half of the year. Rwanda's growth prospects for 2011 compare favorably with others in the region. Rwanda has demonstrated economic resilience at a time when regional and global shocks have had serious consequences for many neighboring East African Community (EAC) countries. The main drivers of Rwanda's growth for the first half of 2011 were the industrial and services sectors. Increased agricultural production in the second half of 2011 follows the excellent rains in the second planting season(March-June). Rwanda has ambitious plans to transform from a largely agrarian economy, to one led by a vibrant modern non-agricultural private sector, providing goods and services to meet growing internal and regional demands. Household enterprises (HEs) are activities providing goods and services that are run out of the household, usually by one family member although they may incorporate other family members in their operation. This update concludes with a series of policy recommendations for developing HEs which can have a major impact on increasing the output and productivity of this important, but neglected, sector of the economy",

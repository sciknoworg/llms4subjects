                "Boards of directors are complex systems, and it is imperative to understand what the contextual forces are that shape the direction and make-up of boards. This Research Handbook provides inspiration for researchers and practitioners interested in the manifold dimensions and facets of context surrounding boards of directors. The contributions identify the complexity and multiplicity of contexts in which boards of directors work and operate, as well as indicating how board members interact with, and influence their contexts. The chapters explore national and institutional differences, divergent understandings of board requirements, climate change and boards' duties, transformation due to digitalisation, family firms, and micro-contextual dynamics affecting boards and their decisions. This Research Handbook promotes board accountability, questions the relative position of companies in society, and reconsiders governance from a multiple context, multi-actor perspective. Building a greater understanding of the main issues and theories surrounding boards of directors, this Research Handbook will be ideal for students and scholars of business and governance. Practitioners and policy makers can also find material for their evolving frameworks"

            "abstract": "A dramatic increase in knowledge regarding the molecular biology of gliomas has been established over the past few years, and this has led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these patients. This book describes some improvements in the surgical management of gliomas, including segmentation of brain MRI images using 4D MRI volumes to help with the diagnosis and monitoring of patients. Another novel topic reviewed involves the applications of photosensitizers and their efficacy in the generation of anti-tumor responses in photodynamic therapy. A review of the application of nanoparticles and their ability to deliver drugs to the tumor site with a reduction in systemic toxicity is another developing therapy discussed. The book also describes novel approaches involving the development of the use of microRNAs, which are non-coding RNAs that can be used as tumor suppressors that potentially can be developed to control the growth of gliomas. The book examines a large number of molecular interactions of signals in gliomas, which should lead to biomarkers of potential importance that could be manipulated in the development of clinical trials. Molecular networks need to be better understood for the development of therapeutic strategies. Finally, the book reviews immunotherapeutic strategies potentially useful in treating brain tumors that involve either poxviruses engineered to secrete IL-15- or IL-2-secreting fibroblasts transfected with tumor DNA. The stimulation of the immune system to selectively attack malignant cells should lead to the prolongation of survival of brain tumor patients without a decline in cognitive functions or other side effects. It is hoped that this new information will lead to improved and efficacious treatment strategies for these challenging tumors",

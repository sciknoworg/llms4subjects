            "abstract": "'This comprehensive book deals with key issues of rural development. The authors address emergent issues of policy, structure and agency in complex and contrasting settings. Many of the chapters are written by scholars who are well-known in their areas of expertise, and younger scholars contribute in new areas of rural development concerns. The research and analysis presented makes clear that rural is more than agriculture, although in some regions it is still a driver. By looking at the twin issues of conservation and development in the context of complex social relations, this Handbook is a must for both scholars and practitioners of development. By including key articles that address emerging rural development issues in Latin America, Africa and Asia, the volume integrates global structures and local responses in a coherent and engaging manner.' (Cornelia Flora, Iowa State University, US). -- Although most countries in the world are rapidly urbanizing, the majority of the global population - particularly the poor - continue to live in rural areas. This Handbook rejects the popular notion that urbanization should be universally encouraged and presents clear evidence of the vital importance of rural people and places, particularly in terms of environmental conservation. Expert contributors from around the world explore how global trends, state policies and grassroots movements affect contemporary rural areas in both developed and developing countries. Rural development policies have historically focused primarily on increasing agricultural productivity, but this volume demonstrates the need for a much broader approach as rural producers become increasingly integrated into the global economy. Following a comprehensive discussion of rural development theory and policy, the contributors tackle a number of diverse topics, including resource dependence, migration, entrepreneurship and microfinance, tourism and gender issues. The book concludes with detailed explorations of rural development in different areas of the world, including Africa, China and Latin America. Professors and students of development studies, agricultural economics, environmental studies and sociology will find this Handbook an indispensable resource, as will practitioners and policymakers working in rural areas around the world.",

Due to the diversification of France's religious landscape (notably with a Muslim minority estimated at 7% of the population) and some of the effects of Europeanisation, French secularism is being urged to shed its anti-religious tendencies and abandon a version of secularism conceived as an alternative to religion. The French Republic is not a secularist state but a secular state where secularism is conceived as a founding principle of pluralistic democracies",

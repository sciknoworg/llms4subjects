            "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence has increasingly been playing an essential role in diverse areas in medicine, assisting clinicians in patient management. In nephrology and transplantation, artificial intelligence can be utilized to enhance clinical care, such as through hemodialysis prescriptions and the follow-up of kidney transplant patients. Furthermore, there are rapidly expanding applications and validations of comprehensive, computerized medical records and related databases, including national registries, health insurance, and drug prescriptions. For this Special Issue, we made a call to action to stimulate researchers and clinicians to submit their invaluable works and present, here, a collection of articles covering original clinical research (single- or multi-center), database studies from registries, meta-analyses, and artificial intelligence research in nephrology including acute kidney injury, electrolytes and acid\u2013base, chronic kidney disease, glomerular disease, dialysis, and transplantation that will provide additional knowledge and skills in the field of nephrology and transplantation toward improving patient outcomes",

            "abstract": "\"Drawing from a diverse range of interdisciplinary voices, this book explores how spaces of care shape our affective, material, and social forms, from the most intimate scale of the body to our planetary commons. Typical definitions of care center around the maintenance of a liveable life: encompassing everything from shelter and welfare to health and safety. Architecture plays a fundamental role in these definitions, inscribed in institutional archetypes such as the home, the hospital, the school, and the nursery. However, these spaces often structure modes of care that prescribe gender roles, bodily norms, and labor practices. How can architecture instead engage with an expanded definition of care that eschews such roles and norms, producing more hybrid entanglements between our bodies, our collective lives, and our environments? Chapters in this volume explore issues ranging from disabled domesticities and nursing, unbuilding whiteness in the built environment, practices and pedagogies of environmental care, and the solidarity networks within 'The Cloud'. Case studies include Floating University Berlin, commoning initiatives by the Black Panther party, and hospitals for the United Mine Workers of America, among many other sites and scales of architectural care. Exploring architecture through the lenses of gender studies, labor theory, environmental justice, and the medical humanities, this volume will engage students and academics from a wide range of disciplines\"--",

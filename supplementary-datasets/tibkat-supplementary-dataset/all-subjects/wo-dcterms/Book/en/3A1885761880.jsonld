            "abstract": "This collection spotlights the diachronic dimensions of the linguistic landscape, the importance of exploring temporal dissonances in historical events in order to better understand semiotic, political, and social transformations across different communities over the last century. The volume seeks to expand the current borders of linguistic landscape (LL) research by situating the analysis of signs in the LL within their time\u2013space organization, which has been understudied in existing scholarship. The book, featuring chapters from established and emerging scholars, argues that a focus on the historicity of the city text can reveal unique insights into the role of semiotic processes as precursors and support mechanisms for political and social changes. The collection is structured around different temporal clusters and geographic contexts across&nbsp;the globe where shorter and longer waves of politically driven resemioticization can be most sharply observed\u2013 post-colonial communities; post-communist societies; and recent and current sociopolitical upheavals. Taken together, the volume proposes&nbsp; a kaleidoscope view of the complex temporalities that underpin multimodal discourses in contested public spaces, offering new directions for research. This book will be of interest to students and scholars in sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, semiotics, visual anthropology, and political science",

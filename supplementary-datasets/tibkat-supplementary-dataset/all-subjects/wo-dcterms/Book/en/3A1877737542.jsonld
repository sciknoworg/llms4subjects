            "abstract": "The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) refers to an ecosystem of interconnected physical objects and devices that are accessible through the Internet and can communicate with each other. The main strength of the IoT vision is the high impact it has created and will continue to do so on several aspects of the everyday life and behavior of its potential users. This book presents some of the state-of-the-art research work in the field of the IoT, especially on the issues of communication protocols, interoperability of protocols and semantics, trust security and privacy issues, reference architecture design, and standardization. It will be a valuable source of knowledge for researchers, engineers, practitioners, and graduate and doctoral students who are working in various fields of the IoT. It will also be useful for faculty members of graduate schools and universities",

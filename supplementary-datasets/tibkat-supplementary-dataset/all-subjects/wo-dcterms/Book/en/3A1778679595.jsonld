            "abstract": "Over the recent years, biochemistry has become responsible for explaining living processes such that many scientists in the life sciences from agronomy to medicine are engaged in biochemical research. This book contains an overview focusing on the research area of proteins, enzymes, cellular mechanisms and chemical compounds used in relevant approaches. The book deals with basic issues and some of the recent developments in biochemistry. Particular emphasis is devoted to both theoretical and experimental aspect of modern biochemistry. The primary target audience for the book includes students, researchers, biologists, chemists, chemical engineers and professionals who are interested in biochemistry, molecular biology and associated areas. The book is written by international scientists with expertise in protein biochemistry, enzymology, molecular biology and genetics many of which are active in biochemical and biomedical research. We hope that the book will enhance the knowledge of scientists in the complexities of some biochemical approaches; it will stimulate both professionals and students to dedicate part of their future research in understanding relevant mechanisms and applications of biochemistry",

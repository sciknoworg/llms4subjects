            "title": "Zeolites and Their Applications",
            "abstract": "Zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals of the family of microporous solids. According to the US Geological Survey, there are about 40 naturally occurring zeolites, forming in sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The most commonly mined forms include clinoptilolite, chabazite and mordenite. There are over 200 synthetic zeolites. For their abundance, natural and synthetic zeolites are widely used in the industry, agriculture, water treatment, wastewater treatment and as dietary supplements to treat diarrhea, autism, cancer and other. This book Zeolites and Their Applications deals with several aspects of zeolite morphology, synthesis and applications. The book is divided into three sections and structured into nine chapters. The first section includes the introductory chapter, the second section explains mineralogy, morphology and synthesis of zeolites and the third section focuses on the different applications of both natural and synthetic zeolites. So, in this book, the readers will obtain updated information on mineralogy, morphology, synthesis and application of zeolites. Scientists from different scientific fields reported in this book their findings",

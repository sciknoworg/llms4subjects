            "abstract": "From the mid-nineteenth-century Hui rebellions, which challenged centralised state control, to the early-twentieth-century revolutions, which led to Yunnan\u2019s decades-long independence, local actors shaped the history of Yunnan through their extensive cross-border networks and contradictory roles in the attempted state consolidation of this contested area. Among the local elites, the state agents, both Han and non-Han, acted on the state's behalf in the borderlands\u2019 affairs while seeking the balance between the interests of the state and their own communities. The state agents competed with each other while utilising and wresting with the state authorities. The dynamic relationship between the state and local actors created another contested facet of modern Yunnan\u2019s transformation. Competing narratives emerged when local actors negotiated and reconstructed their status within the contemporary Chinese nation-state. Bandits became heroes; separatists became patriots; a vibrant regional center became an isolated, exotic, and marginal province of the People\u2019s Republic of China",

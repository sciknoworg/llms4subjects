            "title": "Alternative Delivery Channels and Technology : Handbook",
            "abstract": "The ambition to reach full global financial inclusion requires that we address the challenge of delivering appropriate and affordable financial services to an estimated 2.5 billion unbanked individuals globally. One response to this challenge has involved the design of products such as microloans, low balance savings accounts, micro-insurance, and mobile money transfer that are specifically tailored to meet the needs of the often excluded low-income mass market. Delivering these products and services on a large scale, however, cannot be achieved without accessible channels that lower the cost of service and increase reach. Alternative delivery channels (ADC), defined as those channels that expand the reach of services beyond the traditional bank branch channel, have emerged as a result of innovations in information and communication technology and a shift in consumer expectations. This handbook serves as a tool for Financial Services Providers (FSPs) to increase the technical understanding of ADC platforms and to provide practical guidance on how to approach an ADC technology project. The handbook is structured as follows: 1) Chapter one provides an overview of ADCs and the technologies that underpin them; 2) Chapter two offers guidelines to develop a channel strategy, taking into account the internal and external factors that impact strategy decisions; 3) Chapter three outlines the different components of a technology platform, aiming to provide guidance on how the channel strategy can be mapped to a specific technology platform; 4) Chapter four highlights the importance of identifying requirements and outlines the steps involved in selecting the right provider and solution; and 5) Chapter five introduces a best-practice implementation methodology and key considerations for a successful implementation. In addition, the chapter discusses how a channel should be monitored, maintained and scaled up after going live",

            "abstract": "This chapter presents advances found in the study of different organizations and the results of pilot projects of creative and cultural industries (cci) in Latin Ameri-ca. It also establishes some parameters for cci develop-ment in theoretical and academic terms including the observed in practice. In Latin America, programs and projects have been carried out and, although they have shown a new panorama, concepts and policies are still being analyzed and built. Analysis made by organiza-tions such as the Organization of Ibero-American States (oei), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cul-tural Organization (unesco), the International Confeder-ation of Societies of Authors and Composers (cisac) and Ernst & Young (ey) (2015), among others, have focused their studies on the most important variables for the development of these new industries. However, there is still a gap regarding the real scope and impact of what is called a motor of socio-economic development for the territory. This chapter presents two relevant cases in the region: i) the Cultural Industries Project of Cali, and ii) the Trama Project of Chile. These are pilot projects that allow us to observe some results in two commu-nities located in different places in regards to creative and cultural entrepreneurship promotion, organization of sectors, networks shaping, and the impact of these processes in a production and social framework; and in-vites to a deep study of these cases for the evolution of the cci in the region",

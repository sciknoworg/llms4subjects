            "title": "Climate change justice and human rights: An African perspective",
            "abstract": "Populations in Africa are vulnerable to both the direct and indirect adverse effects of climate change that are of human rights significance. The urgency for states in Africa to implement climate interventions while they face developmental challenges, however, raises questions of \u2018justice\u2019 or \u2018fairness\u2019 between the developed and the developing states. Consequently, interrogating how the human rights paradigm may respond to negative implications of climate change and its \u2018fairness\u2019 is important as states continue to engage with the climate change standard setting.  This edited volume critically interrogates human rights paradigm as an intervention to secure climate change justice for vulnerable populations; analyses regional protection against human rights consequences of climate change; and assesses emerging interventions based on domestic regulatory frameworks on climate change in selected states in Africa",

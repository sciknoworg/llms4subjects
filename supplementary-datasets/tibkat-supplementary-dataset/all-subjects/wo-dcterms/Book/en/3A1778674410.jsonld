            "abstract": "In Divisible Cities takes Italo Calvino\u2019s classic re-imagining of Venice, viewed in the mind\u2019s eye from many different metaphysical angles, and projects it on to the world at large. Where the Italian saw his favorite city as an impossible metropolis of many moods, shades, and ways of being, this unauthorized sequel unpacks the Escheresque streets in unexpected directions. In Divisible Cities is thus an exercise in cartographic origami: the reflective and poetic result of the narrator\u2019s desire to map hidden cities, secret cities, imaginary cities, impossible cities, and overlapping cities, existing beneath the familiar Atlas of everyday perception. Stitching these different places and spaces together is a \u201cdouble helix\u201d or \u201cSiamese seduction\u201d between the traveler and his romantic shadow, revealing \u2014 step by step \u2014 a clandestine itinerary of hidden affinities, nestled within the habitual rhythm of things. Matter matters. That\u2019s what the drone of the city tells us. And yet we dream of something beyond these invisible walls. Were I an architect-deity, I would create an Escheresque subway system, linking all the cities in the world. The tunnels themselves, and the people decanted from one place to the other, would eventually create an Ecumenopolis: a single and continuous city, enlaced and endless. Were this the case I could get on the F train at Delancey Street, Manhattan, and \u2014 after a couple of changes mid-town \u2014 emerge in the night-markets of Taipei, or near the Roman baths of Budapest. Or perhaps even downtown Urville",

            "abstract": "Recovering Identity examines a critical tension in criminalized women\u2019s identity work. Through in-depth qualitative and photo-elicitation interviews, Cesra\u00e9a Rumpf shows how formerly incarcerated women engaged recovery and faith-based discourses to craft rehabilitated identities, defined in opposition to past identities as \u201ccriminal-addicts.\u201d While these discourses made it possible for women to carve out spaces of personal protection, growth, and joy, they also promoted individualistic understandings of criminalization and the violence and dehumanization that followed. Honoring criminalized women\u2019s stories of personal transformation, Rumpf nevertheless strongly critiques institutions\u2019 promotion of narratives that impose lifelong moral judgment while detracting attention from the structural forces of racism, sexism, and poverty that contribute to women\u2019s vulnerability to violence. \u201cA deeply moving account of the indignity that women who are criminalized experience as they fight for their freedom. Cesra\u00e9a Rumpf\u2019s sharp critique demands that we see the violence of incarceration and deepen our commitment to justice for criminalized women.\u201d \u2014 BETH E. RICHIE , coauthor of Abolition. Feminism. Now. \u201cRecovering Identity makes a major contribution to the study of gender, race, and culture in the era of mass incarceration. Rumpf\u2019s comprehensive analysis of how women counter the negative effects of the criminal legal system is timely, thoroughly researched, and persuasive.\u201d \u2014 KEESHA M. MIDDLEMASS, author of Convicted and Condemned: The Politics and Policies of Prisoner Reentry \u201cRumpf persuasively demonstrates how 12-step ideology obscures the structural forces driving mass incarceration. A sensitive, rigorous, and compelling contribution.\u201d \u2014 MELISSA THOMPSON, coauthor of Motherhood after Incarceration: Community Reintegration for Mothers in the Criminal Legal System",

            "abstract": "Before he became the father of cinematic special effects, George M\u00e9li\u00e8s (1861-1938) was a maker of deluxe French footwear, an illusionist, and a caricaturist.  Proceeding from these beginnings, M\u00e9li\u00e8s Boots traces how the full trajectory of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s'  career during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, along with the larger cultural and historical contexts in which M\u00e9li\u00e8s operated, shaped his cinematic oeuvre.  Solomon examines M\u00e9li\u00e8s' unpublished drawings and published caricatures, the role of laughter in his magic theater productions, and the constituent elements of what M\u00e9li\u00e8s called \"the new profession of the cin\u00e9aste.\"  The book also reveals M\u00e9li\u00e8s' connections to the Incoh\u00e9rents, a group of ephemeral artists from the 1880s, demonstrating the group's relevance for M\u00e9li\u00e8s, early cinema, and modernity.  By positioning M\u00e9li\u00e8s in relation to the material culture of his time, Solomon demonstrates that M\u00e9li\u00e8s' work was expressive of a distinctly modern, and modernist, sensibility that appeared in France during the 1880s in the wake of the Second Industrial Revolution",

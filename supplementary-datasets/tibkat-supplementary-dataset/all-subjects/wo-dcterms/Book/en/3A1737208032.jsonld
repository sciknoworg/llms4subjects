            "abstract": "\"As a continuation of the author's previous book : An Introduction to the Theory of Piezoelectricity (Springer, New York, 2005) on the three-dimensional theory of piezoelectricity, this book covers one- and two-dimensional theories of piezoelectric structures including rods, beams, plates and shells. In addition to the so-called low-frequency motions of extension and bending, high-frequency motions of thickness shear and thickness stretch are also considered for certain applications unique in resonant piezoelectric devices. Both single-layer and multi-layer structures are treated. Nonlinear effects due to large deflection or large shear deformation are also discussed. The emphasis in on the development of structural theories with various levels of sophistication for different applications in piezoelectric devices. The book is heavily influenced by R D Mindlin's early contributions to this field. It is destined to be one of the most systematic and comprehensive books on piezoelectric structures. This second edition is a major reorganization of the first edition with multiple additions as well as deletion of chapters and sections\"--",

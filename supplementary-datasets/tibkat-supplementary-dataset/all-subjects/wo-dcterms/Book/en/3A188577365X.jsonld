            "abstract": "In recent years, consumers have become increasingly aware of the impact that food and diet can have on their health. This, together with the concern about the impact of animal food production on the environment, has promoted the demand for alternative food sources with health-promoting benefits and whose production is based on sustainable and environmentally friendly systems. Thus, the global market for plant-based foods with beneficial health properties is on an upward trend and is expected to continue in the coming years. Based on scientific evidence, this book shows the potential of traditional plant foods as alternative sources of bioactive compounds for reducing the incidence and prevalence of current chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, neurological, and metabolic disorders, and nutritional deficiencies",

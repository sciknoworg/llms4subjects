            "abstract": "Process Analytical Chemistry, like the whole field of analytical chemistry, plays an integral and essential role in every industrial company based on chemical processes. It aids to decision making in the series of process steps, so its results have decisive technical, economic and ecological effects. This book is aimed at analytical practitioners, chemical engineers and process engineers who require information about the possibilities and the methods of process analytics and knowledge about their effectiveness and efficiency, e.g. with regard to industrial process optimization, as well as at the advanced students of analytical chemistry, chemical engineering (chemical process technology), and material sciences. In particular, the chemical engineers and chemical engineering technicians working in small and medium-sized companies are also included since they have to solve process analytical problems without an experienced analyst at their sides. Therefore references to the literature and lists of suppliers are added to particular chapters, naturally these cannot make any claims to completeness, but they are intended as being helpful as an indication and enables practical problems to be solved more easily. In special chapters, examples of the interaction and the mutual dependence and the reciprocal influence of various disciplines are described. In this way, for example, the analyst or chemical engineer is directly acquainted with the necessity and the results of an interdisciplinary dialogue",

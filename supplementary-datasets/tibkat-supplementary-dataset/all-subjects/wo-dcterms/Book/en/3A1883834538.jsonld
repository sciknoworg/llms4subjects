            "abstract": "\"This book examines architecture, image and media relationships as productive for architecture and architectural discourses. By arguing that the relationships between architecture and media cannot be dismissed via linear criticism of architecture and media or image, these relations are instead seen as a part of a sphere (a mediasphere) of complex relationships. In lieu of anything like a consensus on the contemporary condition of architecture (referring to the late twentieth and the twenty-first century), the starting point of this book is that the relationships between architecture, media and images continue to multiply, owing to continuous technological advancements. Contemporary architecture considered in this book is related to the selected circumstances of high visibility, where architectural images are propelled into visibility and conflated with non-architectural images. This takes architecture outside of architectural-only discourse and into the public realm. By granting higher visibility to both the architectural images and architecture in the public realm, architecture can be also influenced by the various perceptions of the general public, and can enter public consciousness via non-architectural media. With increased visibility, architecture's far-reaching presence calls for more structured analysis of its nature and potential. As the analysed architecture in this book is associated with the discourses outside of architecture (some of which relate to terrorism, natural disaster, and branding and consumption), the limits of contemporary architectural discipline are questioned and extended. This book is written for academics and students in architectural history, theory and criticism, particularly those interested in visual and media studies\"--",

            "abstract": "The present volume C 3 describes the thorium-nitrogen compounds. Included are compounds both of technological importance like the nitrides and the nitrates and those of merely scientific interest, such as amides and related compounds. However, due to the decreasing technical importance of the nuclear thorium fuel cycle, especially with the advanced fuels like the nitride ThN, in recent years, the thorium compounds with nitrogen have been investigated much less extensively than the corresponding uranium compounds. In order to have the data for the Th-N-X systems accumulated in one specific volume, the decision was made to publish this volume without incorporating other Th systems. In connection with the recent treatment of radium and the actinides, the Gmelin Institute is carrying out the description of thorium and its compounds. The supplement volumes C 1 and C 2 describing its compounds with the noble gases, hydrogen, and the oxygen compounds have already been published; Volume C 5 describing its compounds with sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and boron has also been published. Part A is devoted to the description of the element, and volume A 2, covering the isotopes and the recovery of thorium has been published. The chemistry in solution is dealt with in Part D of which volume 2, covering the solvent extraction of thorium, has been published. Suppl. Vol. E describing the coordination compounds has also been published",

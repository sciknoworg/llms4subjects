            "abstract": "\"Curated in China: Manipulating the City through the Shenzhen Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism\\Architecture 2005-2019 provides an in-depth observation of an architecture and urbanism exhibition with transformative objectives. It uses simultaneous narratives to explore scales and perspectives, the layered spatial and political agency that an ephemeral event - the Shenzhen Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism\\Architecture - has gradually established in the city between 2005 and 2019. Encapsulating Shenzhen's ambitions as a world-class city, the Biennale aims to actively build a relationship between architecture and socio-spatial issues as a device to not only investigate the city's hypertrophic development, but also manipulate its urban fabric. The spaces transformed by the exhibition convey visual delight and urban extravaganza; they also embody the interlocking of multiple (intellectual, corporate and institutional) actors who exploit the event in the pursuit of different goals. Everybody strolls around and enjoys the spectacle set up in the allegedly pacifying space of the exhibition; nevertheless, what lies behind - and beyond - the event? By addressing students and scholars in the fields of architecture and urban space, the book unpacks the layered frictions between a temporary event's narrative apparatus and its physical outcomes, questioning the relationship between biennials as theoretical platforms and their agency in real urban spaces\"--",

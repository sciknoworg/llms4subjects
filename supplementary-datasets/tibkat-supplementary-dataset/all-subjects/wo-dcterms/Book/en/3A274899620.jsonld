                "The story of Susan B. Anthony who changed the history of American women with her new vision of equality",
                "This comprehensive biography of Susan B. Anthony traces the life of a feminist icon, bringing new depth to our understanding of her influence on the course of women\u2019s history. Beginning with her humble Quaker childhood in rural Massachusetts, taking readers through her late twenties when she left a secure teaching position to pursue activism, and ultimately tracing her evolution into a champion of women\u2019s rights, this book offers an in-depth look at the ways Anthony\u2019s life experiences shaped who she would become. Drawing on countless letters, diaries, and other documents, Kathleen Barry offers new interpretations of Anthony\u2019s relationship with feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and illuminating insights on Anthony\u2019s views of men, marriage, and children. She paints a vivid picture of the political, economic, and cultural milieu of 19th-century America. And, above all, she brings a very real Susan B. Anthony to life. Here we find a powerful portrait of this most singular woman\u2014who she was, what she felt, and how she thought. Complete with a new preface to honor the 100th anniversary of women\u2019s suffrage and Anthony\u2019s vital role in the fight for voting rights, this thorough biography gives us essential new insight into the life and legacy of an enduring American heroine."

            "title": "Durability of carbon fiber reinforced plastics",
            "abstract": "\"Koyanagi presents a concise and practical guide to using a micromechanics approach to predict the strength and durability of unidirectionally aligned continuum carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs). As the use of composite materials in becomes more widespread in various fields, material durability is becoming an increasingly important consideration, particularly with regard to UN Sustainable Development Goals. Using more durable composite materials would help with achieving these goals. Because the failure of composite materials proceeds via the accumulation of micro failures and micro damage, a micromechanics approach is indispensable for estimating precise durability. In this practical guide, Koyanagi describes this approach and explains the precise durability of the composite materials with regard to the time dependence of micro failures. This book first explains the strength and durability of unidirectionally aligned continuum CFRPs. It then individually addresses fiber, resin, and the interface between the two on the basis of their micromechanics and introduces these components' time and temperature dependences. Koyanagi uses finite element analysis and theoretical models to integrate the characteristics of the three components to explain the macro properties of the CFRPs. Various characteristics regarding strength and durability of CFRPs are also presented. This book is a valuable resource for researchers in academia and industry who work with composite materials. It will enable them to design composite structures, ensure their durability, evaluate them, and develop more durable composite materials\"--",

            "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being increasingly used in neuroscience and clinics. Modern advances include but are not limited to the combination of TMS with precise neuronavigation as well as the integration of TMS into a multimodal environment, e.g., by guiding the TMS application using complementary techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), or magnetoencephalography (MEG). Furthermore, the impact of stimulation can be identified and characterized by such multimodal approaches, helping to shed light on the basic neurophysiology and TMS effects in the human brain. Against this background, the aim of this Special Issue was to explore advancements in the field of TMS considering both investigations in healthy subjects as well as patients",

                "The Eurozone and migration crises exposed severe gaps in the administrative capacity of the EU. This fine volume offers an insightful interdisciplinary and comparative analysis of how EU Agencies were strengthened in response. \u2014Frank Schimmelfennig, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland The proliferation, design and accountability of EU agencies is the focus of a vibrant academic debate. The editors have assembled a timely and stellar volume, which widens the research agenda on EU agencies. \u2014Berthold Rittberger, Ludwig Maximilian Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany In the literature on the crises that have beset the EU, the role of agencies has often been overlooked. This volume fills that gap, but it also does a lot more. Combining insights from legal scholars and political scientists, it contributes to important and topical debates about the role of agencies in EU governance. \u2014Hussein Kassim, Professor of Politics, University of East Anglia, UK, and ESRC Senior Fellow \u2018The UK in a Changing Europe\u2019 This book provides a wealth of empirical material to understand key aspects of EU governance including its plurality of actors and policy making modes and its functioning during crisis management. Authored by legal scholars and political scientists, it presents new research and insights on the role of EU agencies in the context of the Euro and migration crises. Specifically, the contributions assess why the crises have led to the creation of new EU agencies and what roles these agencies have performed since their inception; how the crisis, notably the migration crisis, has impacted on existing EU agencies; how EU agencies have shaped the policies during and after the crises; and, how the crisis has affected the accountability of EU agencies. This book is essential in understanding the intricacies of EU crisis management and the specific role of EU agencies therein, as well as EU governance more broadly. Johannes Pollak is Professor of International Relations and European Politics at Webster Vienna Private University, Austria, as well as senior research fellow at the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies. Peter Slominski is an assistant professor at the Department of Political Science/Centre for European Integration Research (eif) at the University of Vienna, Austria. .",

            "abstract": "The focus of this book is kinematic and dynamic control of a single mobile robot or a group of them. New simple and integrated solutions are presented for tasks of positioning, trajectory tracking and path following. Control of Ground and Aerial Robots synthesizes new results on control of mobile robots developed by M.Sc. and Ph.D. students supervised by the authors. The robots considered are wheeled mobile platforms, with emphasis on differential drive vehicles, and the multirotor aerial robots. Integrated control solutions based on the technique of feedback linearization are proposed to guide either a single robot or a homogeneous/heterogeneous group of mobile robots. Examples on the use of the proposed controllers are also provided. Finally, Control of Ground and Aerial Robots is intended to help graduate and advanced undergraduate students in engineering, as well as researchers in the area of robot control, to design controllers to autonomously guide the more common mobile platforms.",

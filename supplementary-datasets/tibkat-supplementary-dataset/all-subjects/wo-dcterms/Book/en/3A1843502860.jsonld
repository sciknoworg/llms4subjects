The 12 regular papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 50 submissions. The proceedings also contain 2 tool papers, 2 NIER papers, and 2 competition papers from the Test-Comp Competition. The papers deal with the foundations on which software engineering is built, including topics like software engineering as an engineering discipline, requirements engineering, software architectures, software quality, model-driven development, software processes, software evolution, AI-based software engineering, and the specification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems, such as (self-)adaptive, collaborative, AI, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, cyber-physical, or service-oriented applications. ."

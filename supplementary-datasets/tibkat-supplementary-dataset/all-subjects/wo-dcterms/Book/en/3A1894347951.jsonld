            "abstract": "\"In this book, Hollander explores the idea of home as the natural surroundings that people live in: a place of living, changing beauty, refuge, and above all, joy, where family and friends gather to create a lifetime of memories. The book presents homes in the countryside, along the coast, and in town--and features a rich diversity of projects, from country estates to rooftop gardens. Throughout, Hollander discusses essential elements in his firm's work: the importance of the procession of entry to a house, as well as its context in the landscape; the positioning of plant life and trees; the way people move into and through a property; and the way a garden looks and changes through the seasons. Within each project there are a striking variety of components--outdoor rooms for living and lounging, including oceanside hearths, infinity pools, and verdant dining spaces, as well as pollinator gardens, naturalistic meadows, and tranquil all\u00e9es. Site maps illuminate each site, and the images capture moments large and small, from views of winding pathways to a vine-covered arbor and a rabbit enjoying flowers at dawn.\"--",

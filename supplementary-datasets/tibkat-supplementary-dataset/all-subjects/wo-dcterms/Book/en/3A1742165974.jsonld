            "abstract": "Although debates over tax preferences are long-standing, recent changes in the energy landscape are generating new arguments for and against reform. Policymakers considering this issue need a thorough understanding of the potential consequences of tax reform in the new energy context. Unfortunately, existing studies either fail to seriously analyze the economic effects of removing tax preferences or are not transparent or publicly available. To fill the gap, this study models firm behavior in response to the potential loss of each of the three major tax preferences, which collectively cost the government roughly $4 billion annually. It finds that domestic oil drilling activity could decline by roughly 9 percent, and domestic gas drilling activity could decline by roughly 11 percent, depending on natural gas prices. These declines in drilling would in turn lead to a long-run decline in domestic oil and gas production. As a result, the global price of oil could rise by 1 percent by 2030 and domestic production could drop 5 percent; global consumption could fall by less than 1 percent. Domestic natural gas prices, meanwhile, could rise between 7 and 10 percent, and both domestic production and consumption of natural gas could fall between 3 and 4 percent. These results make it possible to assess each tax preference against three policy objectives: improving U.S. energy security, mitigating climate change, and saving taxpayer dollars. The estimated effects of removing the preferences on energy prices, domestic production, and global consumption suggest that none of the three preferences directly and materially improve U.S. energy security or mitigate climate change. If eliminated, however, they could enhance U.S. influence to advocate for international climate action and generate fiscal savings",

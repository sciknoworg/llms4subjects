                "This book sheds light on modern populism and discusses the link between populism and identity politics against the backdrop of populist leaders asserting the identity of their own group, while maintaining the separation from others. Written by former BBC correspondent and commentator Deepak Tripathi, the book explains how populism has a long history with early discernable origins in the Tsarist Russian Empire and North America in the nineteenth century, spreading to Latin America, Europe, and elsewhere in the following century. The book analyzes various forms of populism, its causes and consequences. It further looks at how industrialization, economic growth, and movement of people led to conditions which contributed to inequalities, fueling populist sentiments and social conflict around the globe. Tripathi concludes that populism has moved from the fringes to the mainstream of politics, and is here to stay, given factors such as growing competition for resources, population increase, climate change, and migration. The book will appeal to students, scholars, and researchers of political science and neighboring disciplines, as well as policy-makers interested in a better understanding of modern populism and its roots. Written in a graceful, informative style, this book explores the rise of populism on the global scene and exposes its dangers. Mark Juergensmeyer, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Sociology and Global Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of Global Rebellion: Religious Challenges to the Secular State Deepak Tripathi provides the first lucid and comprehensive analysis of a political phenomenon that engulfs many states and societies today. Ilan Pappe, Professor of History, and Director of the European Centre for Palestine Studies, University of Exeter This wide-ranging and clear-sighted book gives a historically-informed account of how populism went mainstream. It is a fascinating read. Richard Toye, Professor of Modern History, University of Exeter.",

            "abstract": "Dietary habits differ from person to person and usually are determined by cultural habits and traditions that determine lifestyles linked to the socio-demographic characteristics associated with ethnicity. It is known that dietary habits, lifestyle and socio-demographic factors impact human health. Eating disorders, increasing consumption of less-healthy foods, lack of exercise, genetic predisposition, along with other factors, increase risk of diseases such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and various mental disorders. This reprint entitled \u201cDietary Influence on Nutritional Epidemiology, Public Health and Our Lifestyle\u201d, addresses the associations between some dietary patterns, lifestyle and socio-demographic factors, analyzed either separately or in combination, with the risk and management of cardiovascular diseases and mental health problems, such as depression and dementia. This reprint includes nine original articles and one systematic review",

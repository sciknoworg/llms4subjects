            "abstract": "\u201cChina is so large that its trading interests and influence are global. But its interests are disproportionately powerful in its immediate Western Pacific and Asia Pacific partners. The evolution of China\u2019s economic relationships with its Asia Pacific partners, in which APEC came to play a significant role in the 1990s, is thus a central part of the story of China\u2019s rapidly growing and changing interaction with the global economy.\u201d - Ross Garnaut  APEC is an important forum thorugh which China can demonstrate its commitment to economic openness. APEC has also been an important vehicle for China\u2019s trade liberalisation on the way towards accession to the WTO.  In facilitating trade liberalisation, APEC and te WTO are mutually reinforcing. APEC prepares China for the WTO and WTO accession encourages China\u2019s active participation in the APEC process. Both APEC membership and WTO accession help with the huge task of China\u2019s domestic reform.  This book sets out China\u2019s strategic interests in APEC in the lead-up to the APEC summit in Shanghai in 2001. Contributors include leading Chinese economists from the APEC Policy Research Centre in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences\u2013Zhang Yunling, Zhang Jianjun, Sun Xuegong, Li Kai, Chen Luzhi, Zhou Xiaobing, Zhao Jianglin\u2013and from the Asia Pacific School of Economics and Management at The Australian National University\u2013Peter Drysdale, Ligang Song, Ross Garnaut, hristopher Findlay, Andrew Elek, Yongzheng Yang, Yiping Huang, K.P.

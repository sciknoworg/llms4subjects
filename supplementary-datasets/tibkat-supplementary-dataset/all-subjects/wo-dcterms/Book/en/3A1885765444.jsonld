            "abstract": "Where and how will we do our shopping tomorrow? With the rise of digital platforms, self-service is being called into question, in the food sector as elsewhere. And yesterday's customer journey is being groped and reinvented. This book imagines four likely scenarios up to 2050. For each of them, it shows how the platforms, based on a specific customer journey, will bring out a new food offering. The products in each scenario combine distinctive modes of consumption and production. In the Personalisation scenario, customers delegate the anticipation of their desires to a platform, which offers them a personalised food stream for their well-being; the offering sees the merging of final processing and local logistics. In the Commitment scenario, empowered customers accept that a platform will control and radically change their diet for the common good; the platforms coordinate to steer the transition to a sustainable food system. In the Community scenario, customers looking for authenticity want to join short-distance platforms where genuine, strong relationships are forged between producers and consumers; the supply chains are decentralised. In the Low Price scenario, customers who have lost interest in their food use platforms to access commoditised products at very competitive prices; production becomes globalised and costs are crushed. This book is aimed at retail professionals, public authorities, researchers and students, as well as consumers and anyone interested in the market economy",

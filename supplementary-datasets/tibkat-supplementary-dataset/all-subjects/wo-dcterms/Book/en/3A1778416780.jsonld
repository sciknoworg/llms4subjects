            "abstract": "Amidst impending climate change and enhanced pollution levels around the globe, the need of the hour is to develop bio-based materials that are sustainable and possess comparable performance properties to their synthetic counterparts. In light of the aforementioned, numerous investigations are being conducted to identify, process, and create materials that are concurrently innocuous towards the environment and have superior properties. This book is a collection of such scientific articles that propagate novel ideas for the development of polymeric composite materials, which have application potential in numerous fields such as medicine, automobile, aviation, construction, etc. It also contains a pedagogical article that proposes some strategies to continue experimental research during pandemics. This book will provide readers a quick glance into recent developments regarding polymeric materials and will encourage them to propagate these research ideas further",

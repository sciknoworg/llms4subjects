            "abstract": "The number of cases of foot and ankle pathology and disorders has increased in the last two decades due to the way of life of the current human beings. On the one hand, there is the trauma category because of motorbike and car accidents; and on the other hand is the chronic syndromes due to everyday overuse of foot and ankle, as in high-demand sports and hobbies, as also in ballet dancing, etc. This book offers an updated guide to foot and ankle pathology and presents everyday trauma categories, as well as chondral and joint chronic syndromes at all ages from childhood to adulthood. Furthermore, the book will allow the reader to evaluate and realize how the foot changes during development from the early stages to adulthood. It also provides an overall outline of the anatomy and foot biomechanics, diagnosis of the pathologies, open or arthroscopic surgical approaches, treatment alternatives, and complications. Foot and Ankle Disorders - Pathology and Surgery will be of major interest for orthopedic residents, as well as for orthopedic surgeons at the first steps of their career, and for experienced ones seeking updated information",

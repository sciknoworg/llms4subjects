            "title": "A Diffusion Hydrodynamic Model",
            "abstract": "The Diffusion Hydrodynamic Model (DHM), as presented in the 1987 USGS publication, was one of the first computational fluid dynamics computational programs based on the groundwater program MODFLOW, which evolved into the control volume modeling approach. Over the following decades, others developed similar computational programs that either used the methodology and approaches presented in the DHM directly or were its extensions that included additional components and capacities. Our goal is to demonstrate that the DHM, which was developed in an age preceding computer graphics/visualization tools, is as robust as any of the popular models that are currently used. We thank the USGS for their approval and permission to use the content from the earlier USGS report",

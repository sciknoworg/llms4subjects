            "title": "Liver Regeneration",
            "abstract": "Doctors and scientists have been aware of the \"phenomenom\" of liver regeneration since the time of the ancient Greeks, illustrated by the mythic tale of Prometheus' punishment. Nevertheless, true insight into its intricate mechanisms have only become available in the 20th century. Since then, the pathways and mechanisms involved in restoring the liver to its normal function after injury have been resolutely described and characterized, from the hepatic stem/progenitor cell activation and expansion to the more systemic mechanisms involving other tissues and organs like bone-marrow progenitor cell mobilization. This book describes some of the complex mechanisms involved in liver regeneration and provides examples of the most up-to-date strategies used to induce liver regeneration, both in the clinic and in the laboratory. The information presented will hopefully benefit not only professionals in the liver field, but also people in other areas of science (pharmacology, toxicology, etc) that wish to expand their knowledge of the fundamental biology that orchestrates liver injury and regeneration",

            "abstract": "This essay examines the interrelation between (peripheral) gender identity and (peripheral) urban space. The analysis focuses on the femminiello, a quintessentially Neapolitan non-binary subjectivity embodying a fluid sexual identity, performatively crossing across masculine and feminine, deeply connected to the territory where it originates\u2014Naples\u2019 inner city and its low-income historic neighborhoods. Accordingly, the essay looks at the material and immaterial interrelations between urban space and the femminiello identity. Methodologically, the study is built on a qualitative approach based mainly on fieldwork interviews with three of the most prominent femminielli of the Neapolitan context: CiroCiretta, a recognized exponent of the femminielli community and among the founders of a cultural association devoted to spreading and preserving the ancient femminiello culture; Tarantina Taran, an iconic local figure dubbed as \u201cNaples\u2019 last femminiello\u201d in the city\u2019s Spanish Quarters; and Loredana, activist and secretary of Naples\u2019 Transsexual Association. The voices and stories of these three femminielli led us to read this non-binary gender identity in its relation to urban space, from different and complementary perspectives, which ultimately helped us trace a map of changing meaning and emerging forms of adaptation over time",

            "abstract": "\"This book analyses rape culture through the lens of the \u2018me too\u2019 era. Drawing feminist theory into conversation with peace studies and improvisation theory, it advocates for peace- building opportunities to transform culture and for the improvisatory resources of \u2018culture- jamming\u2019 as a mechanism to dismantle rape culture. The book\u2019s key argument is that cultural attitudes and behaviours can be shifted through the introduction of disrupting narratives, so each chapter ends with a \u2018culture- jammed\u2019 re- telling of a traditional fairy tale. Chapter 1 traces an overlap of feminist theory and peace studies, arguing that rape culture is most fruitfully understood through the concept of \u2018structural violence.\u2019 Chapter 2 investigates the gender scripts that rape culture produces, considering a female counterpart to the concept of \u2018toxic masculinity\u2019: \u2018complicit femininity.\u2019 Chapter 3 offers analysis of non- consensual sex and a history of consent education, culminating in an argument that we need to move beyond consent to conceptualise a robust \u2018respectful mutuality.\u2019 Chapter 4 \u2019s history of sexual harassment in the workplace and the rise of #metoo argues that its global manifestations are a powerful peace- building initiative. Chapter 5 situates \u2018me too\u2019 within a culture- jamming history, using improvisation theory to show how this movement\u2019s potential can shape cultural reconstruction. This is a provocative and interventionist addition to feminist theory scholarship and is suitable for researchers and students in women\u2019s and gender studies, feminist theory, sociology and peace studies.\"",

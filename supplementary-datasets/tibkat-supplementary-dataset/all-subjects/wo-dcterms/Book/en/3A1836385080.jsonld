            "abstract": "This book examines F\u00e9lix Guattari, the French psychoanalyst, philosopher, and radical activist, renowned for an energetic style of thought that cuts across conceptual, political, and institutional spheres.  Increasingly recognised as a key figure in his own right, Guattari\u2019s influence in contemporary social theory and the modern social sciences continues to grow. From the ecosophy of hurricanes to the micropolitics of cinema, the book draws together a series of Guattarian motifs which animate the complexity of one of the twentieth century\u2019s greatest and most enigmatic thinkers. The book examines techniques and modes of thought that contribute to a liberation of thinking and subjectivity. Divided thematically into three parts \u2013 \u2018cartographies\u2019, \u2018ecologies\u2019, and \u2018micropolitics\u2019 \u2013 each chapter showcases the singular and pragmatic grounds by which Guattari\u2019s signature concepts can be found to be both disruptive to traditional modes of thinking, and generative toward novel forms of ethics, politics and sociality.  This interdisciplinary compendium on Guattari\u2019s exciting, experimental, and enigmatic thought will appeal to academics and postgraduates within Social Theory, Human Geography, and Continental Philosophy",

If the world is shrinking in terms of resources and their access, it is expanding in terms of new candidates for proprietorship. How new relations come into being is among the many questions about property, ownership, and knowledge  brought together here. Twenty years have not diminished interest in the book,\u00c4\u00f4s opening challenge: if one were inventing a method of enquiry by which to configure the complexity of social life, one might wish to invent something like the anthropologist,\u00c4\u00f4s ethnographic practice. A wide range of studies deliberately brings into conversation claims people make on one another through relations imagined in the form of body-substance along with the increasing visibility of conceptual or intellectual work as property. Wherever one lives, categories of knowledge are being dissolved and reformed at a tempo that calls for the lateral reflection afforded through the ,\u00c4\u00faethnographic effect.,\u00c4\u00f9",

Since MPC appeared in the industrial process control field in the 1970's, the demand for constrained optimization control, in particular MPC, in various application fields has been increasing continuously. The MPC application fields extend from traditional oil refinery, petrochemical, and chemical industries, to almost all fields such as power systems, manufacturing, aerospace, electromechanics, urban transportation, agricultural greenhouse, and medicine etc. MPC has the ability to anticipate future events and can take control actions accordingly. PID and LQR controllers do not have this predictive ability. MPC is nearly universally implemented as a digital control, although there is research into achieving faster response times with specially designed analog circuitry\"--",

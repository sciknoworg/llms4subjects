            "abstract": "Following a bloody civil war, peace consolidated slowly and sequentially in Bougainville. That sequence was of both a top-down architecture of credible commitment in a formal peace process and layer upon layer of bottom-up reconciliation. Reconciliation was based on indigenous traditions of peacemaking. It also drew on Christian traditions of reconciliation, on training in restorative justice principles and on innovation in womens\u2019 peacebuilding. Peacekeepers opened safe spaces for reconciliation, but it was locals who shaped and owned the peace. There is much to learn from this distinctively indigenous peace architecture. It is a far cry from the norms of a \u2018liberal peace\u2019 or a \u2018realist peace\u2019. The authors describe it as a hybrid \u2018restorative peace\u2019 in which \u2018mothers of the land\u2019 and then male combatants linked arms in creative ways. A danger to Bougainville\u2019s peace is weakness of international commitment to honour the result of a forthcoming independence referendum that is one central plank of the peace deal",

                "\u201cWell informed from the empirical and the theoretical points of view, this important volume helps reflecting on the ways in which multiple crises affects mobility as well as increasing inequalities In terms of class, ethnic background, gender, and generation. Face to these challenges, solidarity is reclaimed but in new forms.\u201d \u2014Donatella Della Porta, Scuola Normale Superiore, Florence, Italy \u201cThe book is a necessary intervention on the contemporary juncture of multiple crises, reconfiguring mobility regimes, and morbid resurgences. An impressive array of expertise tracing the whimsical operations of capitalist borders, the resistances they call forth, and the reconfigurations of solidarities and citizenships that results. Instructive for our present, and the future, however it ends up being born\u2026\u201d \u2014Olga Demetriou, Durham Global Security Institute, School of Government and International Affairs, Durham University, UK \u201cThe Crisis-Mobility Nexus illuminates the complex relationship between systemic crises and mobility regimes. The book provides a comprehensive understanding of how interconnected crises reconfigure the dynamics of both mobility and immobility through both novel theoretical conceptualizations and intriguing real-world case study analyses.\u201d \u2014Noel B. Salazar, Cultural Mobilities Research (CuMoRe), KU Leuven, Belgium Situated at the intersections of anthropology, migration, citizenship, and social movement studies, this volume theorises a crisis-mobility nexus by focusing on empirical case studies. These concern migration struggles; the entanglements of crisis, social mobility, and citizenship; as well as the impact of COVID-19 (im)mobility on social movements. By highlighting examples from these streams, the book illuminates entanglements between them, while emphasising the role of solidarity as well as de-solidarisation in creating, shaping, or resisting various regimes of mobility. Leandros Fischer is Assistant Professor for International Studies at the Department of Culture and Learning at Aalborg University, Denmark. He researches migration, citizenship, and social and political movements.",

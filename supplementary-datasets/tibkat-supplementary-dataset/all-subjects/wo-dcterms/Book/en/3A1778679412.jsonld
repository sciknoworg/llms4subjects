            "abstract": "As MRI has paved its role in diagnostic angiography. MRA has the potential to provide more physiological and pathophysiological data over the disease in addition to the anatomical information. This book is divided into three sections. The first section discusses the basics of MRI angiography. It starts with focus on the contrast agents that are mainly used in MR angiography with detailed discussion of advantage and limitations of different types of contrast. The second chapter is oriented more towards the technical consideration that contribute to good quality examination, both the non contrast and contrast based sequences from black to bright blood imaging , contrast enhanced MRA, review of clinical application of MRA in different body systems and MR venography. The second section reviews the clinical application of MRI mainly in the head and neck and brain ischemia imaging. The new high resolution intracranial plaque imaging of the branch athermanous disease, to the hemodynamic of intracranial atherosclerotic stroke and quantitative MRA imaging in neurovascular imaging, are the topics in this section. Also this section covers the future prospective and the new frontiers MRI angiography is exploring. In the third section, MRA of aortic disease in children with emphasis on cardiac MRA",

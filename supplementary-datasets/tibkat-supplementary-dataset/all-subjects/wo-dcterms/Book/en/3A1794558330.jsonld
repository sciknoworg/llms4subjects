            "abstract": "The concept of resilience has arisen as a \u201cnew way of thinking\u201d, becoming a response to both the causes and effects of ongoing global challenges. As it strongly stresses cities\u2019 transformative potential, resilience\u2019s final purpose is to prevent and manage unforeseen events and improve communities\u2019 environmental and social quality. Although the resilience theory has been investigated in depth, several methodological challenges remain, mainly related to the concept\u2019s practical sphere. As a matter of fact, resilience is commonly criticised for being too ambiguous and empty of meaning. At the same time, turning resilience into practice is not easy to do. This will arguably be one of the most impactful global issues for future research on resilience. The Special Issue \u201cBridging the Gap: The Measure of Urban Resilience\u201d falls under this heading, and it seeks to synthesise state-of-the-art knowledge of theories and practices on measuring resilience. The Special Issue collected 11 papers that address the following questions: \u201cWhat are the theoretical perspectives of measuring urban resilience? What are the existing methods for measuring urban resilience? What are the main features that a technique for measuring urban resilience needs to have? What is the role of measuring urban resilience in operationalising cities\u2019 ability to adapt, recover and benefit from shocks?\u201d",

            "abstract": "Today more than ever, our world needs creativity and innovation as key pillars to drive growth, face challenges, and stand out in a competitive and demanding world. It has become pressing to reflect on how creativity and innovation can be fostered in society, especially among the younger generation who will be the protagonists of inevitable changes in the future. This book focuses on the intrinsic and fruitful link between creativity and innovation. It encompasses a set of reflections, experiences, and insights on how these two concepts become effective levers of each other. It also focuses on how to foster creativity and innovation in people, organizations, and communities, as well as how creativity and innovation can effectively make a difference for the better in a world that increasingly needs new and innovative solutions to increasingly complex problems. From diverse cultures and scientific fields and dissimilar research methodologies, the contributions that make up this book present an integrated approach to creativity and innovation as central concepts to contribute to a better society and better world. We believe that creativity and innovation are indeed the forces that drive progress, expression, and discovery. Investing in them is investing in a better, more balanced, and sustainable world",

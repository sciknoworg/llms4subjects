            "abstract": "With rapid developments being made in the exploration of marine resources, coastal geohazard and offshore geotechnics have attracted a great deal of attention from coastal geotechnical engineers, with significant progress being made in recent years. Due to the complicated nature of marine environmnets, there are numerous natural marine geohazard preset throughout the world\u2019s marine areas, e.g., the South China Sea. In addition, damage to offshore infrastructure (e.g., monopiles, bridge piers, etc.) and their supporting installations (pipelines, power transmission cables, etc.) has occurred in the last decades. A better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms and soil behavior of the seabed in marine environments will help engineers in the design and planning processes of coastal geotechnical engineering projects. The purpose of this book is to present the recent advances made in the field of coastal geohazards and offshore geotechnics. The book will provide researchers with information reagrding the recent developments in the field, and possible future developments. The book is composed of eighteen papers, covering three main themes: (1) the mechanisms of fluid\u2013seabed interactions and the instability associated with seabeds when they are under dynamic loading (papers 1\u20135); (2) evaluation of the stability of marine infrastructure, including pipelines (papers 6\u20138), piled foundation and bridge piers (papers 9\u201312), submarine tunnels (paper 13), and other supported foundations (paper 14); and (3) coastal geohazards, including submarine landslides and slope stability (papers 15\u201316) and other geohazard issues (papers 17\u201318). The editors hope that this book will functoin as a guide for researchers, scientists, and scholars, as well as practitioners of coastal and offshore engineering",

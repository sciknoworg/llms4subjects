Nutri-Cereals: Nutraceutical and Techno-Functional Potential covers these cereal grains, with each chapter focusing on nutrient composition and bioactive characterization followed by associated bio-functional properties and health benefits. Further, it covers techno-functionality of nutri-cereals including rheological properties, emulsification & foaming potential, gelation behavior, color profile and others which dictate the suitability of cereals in finished products. Although many of the nutri-cereals have been known for thousands of years, due to coarse nature and lack of processing they escaped the human diet. Now, thanks to their excellent agro-economic potential and numerous health benefits, they are once again recognized as functional ingredients. Recently, earmarked investment and funding have been observed for valorization of these crops and thus, this book will help academicians to strengthen future investigations\"--",

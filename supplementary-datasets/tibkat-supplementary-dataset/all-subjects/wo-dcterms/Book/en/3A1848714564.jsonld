            "abstract": "\"Advances in Artificial intelligence (AI) have redefined research and development in many areas, particularly in the direction of engineering research, application of machine learning, and the use of deep learning in many aspects of engineering research. This book looks at the impact of AI and how it has transformed transportation in the form of Smart Traffic Management Systems in a world of unmanned systems and autonomous machines. The book explores the problems faced in air, sea and land transport and traffic. It looks into Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), autonomous and remotely-operated ships, intelligent port management systems, and modern urban railway systems. Redefining Traffic is a reference book for researchers, engineers, and technical personnel specializing in intelligent traffic, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT). It can also be used as a study guide for advanced undergraduates interested in AI, vehicle engineering, automation, and computing\"--",

                "\"The rapid international expansion of Chinese businesses has evoked mixed perceptions in host countries and among policymakers. This volume brings together rigorous studies on the motivation, background, strategy, and impact of Chinese outward foreign direct investment and the emergence of Chinese multinational enterprises (MNEs). It is thus informative for the next wave of academic research on Chinese and emerging market MNEs in international business, political economy, economic geography and political sciences. Together with an original introduction by the editors, this valuable collection provides an important backdrop for academics who intend to understand emerging market MNEs in order to advise policymakers\"--"

            "abstract": "\"The  relationship  between  Jews  and  Christians  and  between  Judaism  and Christianity during the 13th and 14th century is a matter of concrete and contingent  historical  circumstances;  and  its  ideological  elements  are  inherent  in  pre-modern Catholicism and pre-modern Rabbinical Judaism. Indeed, both St. Paul and  the  Rabbis  are  typical  revolutionary  figures  of  late  antiquity  who  present themselves as the authentic interpreters of old sacred writings. Throughout the ages, the interpretation of the Sacra pagina remained at the very center of Chris-tian and Jewish theology involving hidden or manifest polemics against the rival interpretation. Still, this fundamental and fixed element did not prevent dramatic changes in the concrete historical manifestations of Judaism and Christianity. Nowhere else, the parallel developments in both religions were as spectacular, often even traumatic, as in Italy, France, Spain, and Germany, where Jewish communities had existed since late antiquity; and where Jews and Christians had developed stable forms of coexistence.  These were severely shaken by the dramatic events  that marked the ascendancy of European hegemony beginning with the first crusade at the end of the 11thcentury. \"",

            "abstract": "In 2012 and in 2018, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolutions urging the international community to intensify global efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). It also called upon \"States, the United Nations system, civil society and all stakeholders to continue to observe 6 February as the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM/C and to use the day to enhance awareness raising campaigns and to take concrete actions against female genital mutilations\". FGM/C is an extreme type of violence against women and girls which impairs their development potential and impacts the societies in which they live and work, their children, their families and ultimately their countries. FGM/C also undermines the World Bank's efforts to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. Women and girls affected by FGM/C may not be able to reach their full personal, productive and professional potential. FGM/C causes a large number of physical and psychological problems and complications and can even lead to death. It imposes unnecessary suffering and prolonged pain. The international community recognized that FGM/C is an important development challenge that affects more than 200 million women and girls in the world. Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls) includes a target on eliminating all harmful practices against women, such as female genital mutilation by 2030 (target 5.3). This eighth edition describes the international and regional instruments that address FGM/C as well as the national legislations adopted to outlaw FGM/C. This is a practical online tool to empower those fighting FGM/C",

            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Conceptual and technological advances in chemistry and biology have transformed the drug discovery process. Evolutionary pressure among the diverse scientific and engineering disciplines that contribute to the identification of biologically active compounds has resulted in synergistic improvements at every step in the process. Exploiting Chemical Diversity for Drug Discovery encompasses the many components of this transformation and presents the current state-of-the-art of this critical endeavour. From the theoretical and operational considerations in generating a collection of compounds to screen, to the design and implementation of high-capacity and high-quality assays that provide the most useful biological information, this book provides a comprehensive overview of modern approaches to lead identification. Beginning with an introductory overview, subsequent chapters address topics that include the design of chemical libraries and methods for optimizing their diversity; automated and accelerated chemistry; high throughput assay design and detection techniques; and strategies for data analysis and property optimization.  Written by experts in the field, both academic and industrial, and illustrated in full colour, this book provides an excellent overview for current practitioners and will also serve as a stimulating resource for future generations. Researchers in organic and medicinal chemistry, the biological and pharmacological sciences, as well as those interested in allied computational and engineering disciplines will value the comprehensive and up-to-date coverage",

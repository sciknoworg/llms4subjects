            "title": "Social Sciences Teaching in the Face of the Global Challenges of the 21st Century",
            "abstract": "At present, the world is experiencing global changes that have effects on all social, economic, political, and environmental fields, etc. Climate change, natural hazards, social inequalities, immigration, refugees, and the spread of diseases (COVID-19, etc.) are just some examples of topics addressed by Social Sciences. All of these questions can be dealt with in the field of education at all educational stages (including university). We now are now facing different problems that must be dealt with in Social Sciences classes (mainly those of Geography and History), and that can be linked to the so-called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): \u201cgender equality\u201d (SDG 4), \u201cclean water and sanitation\u201d (SDG 5), \u201caffordable and clean energy\u201d (SDG 6), \u201creduction of inequalities\u201d (SDG 10), \u201csustainable cities and communities\u201d (SDG 11), \u201cresponsible production and consumption\u201d (SDG 12), \u201cclimate action\u201d (SDG 13), \u201clife of terrestrial ecosystems\u201d (SDG 15) and \u201cpeace, justice and strong institutions\u201d (SDG 16). This Special Issue aims to answer the following research questions through theoretical and empirical studies: *What are the purposes of teaching History, Geography and Social Sciences in schools today? *What place do social thought formation and social problems have in learning/teaching in Social Sciences?",

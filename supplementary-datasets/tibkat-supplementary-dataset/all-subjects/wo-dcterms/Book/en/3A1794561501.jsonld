            "abstract": "The health and wellbeing of people and the planet is currently receiving a much attention, if only because of the ongoing global crisis instigated by COVID-19. The benefits of nature for human wellbeing have been scientifically studied in multiple disciplines for over three decades. Researchers from disciplines such as ecology, sport science, psychology, tourism, medicine, forestry, environmental studies and architecture have found evidence that being in nature, interacting with nature, and feeling connected to nature are important for good health and wellbeing. In particular, physical activity in nature has been linked to wellbeing. This manuscript explores a particular type of physical activity in nature: adventure and outdoor activity. Adventure in nature is important for wellbeing, and carefully designed interventions and programs can have a profound impact. The work in this book suggests that adventure should be considered an important part of the public health offering",

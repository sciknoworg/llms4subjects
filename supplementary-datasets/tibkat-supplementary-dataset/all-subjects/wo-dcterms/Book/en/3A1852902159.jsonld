                "This open access book provides in-depth and comparative analyses of how young people in peripheral areas in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania perceive EU citizenship. It also informs the reader about the challenges faced by EU Youth Dialogue projects that aim at promoting active (EU) citizenship in these areas and it offers context-specific recommendations for local, regional, national and European policymakers and people working with young people. The contributions are based on new qualitative data collected within the framework of the Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence at Leipzig University. It will be of interest to practitioners and scholars working on Europe and the EU, citizenship and the promotion of an active EU citizenship beyond urban centres. The Editors Dr. Astrid Lorenz is a Professor of German and European Politics, Director of the Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence \u201cThe European Union and its Rural Periphery in East Central Europe\u201d and Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Philosophy at Leipzig University, Germany.

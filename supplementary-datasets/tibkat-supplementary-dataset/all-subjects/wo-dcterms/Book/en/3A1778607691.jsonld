            "abstract": "In Race on Display in 20th- and 21st-Century France Knox turns the tables France\u2019s rhetoric of \u2018internal otherness\u2019, asking her reader not to spot those deemed France\u2019s others but rather to deconstruct the very gazes that produce them. Weaving together a vast corpus of colonial French children\u2019s comics, Francophone novels, and African popular music, fashion, and dance, Knox traces how the ways colonial \u2018human zoos\u2019 invited their French spectators to gaze on their colonized others still inform the frameworks through which racial and ethnic minorities are made\u2014and make themselves\u2014visible in contemporary France. In addition to analyzing how literature and music depicting immigrants and their descendants in France make race and ethnicity visible, Knox also illustrates how the works she analyzes self-reflexively ask whether they, as commodities sold within wider cultural marketplaces, perpetuate the culture of exoticism they seek to contest. Finally, Knox contends that to take seriously the way the texts interrogate the relationship between power, privilege, and the gaze also requires reconsidering the visions of normalcy from which racial and ethnic minorities supposedly depart. She thus concludes by exposing a critical \u2018blind spot\u2019 in French cultural studies\u2014whiteness\u2014before subjecting it to the same scrutiny France\u2019s \u2018visible minorities\u2019 face",

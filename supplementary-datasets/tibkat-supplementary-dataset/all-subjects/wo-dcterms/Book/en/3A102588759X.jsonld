                "\"This practical book provides instruction on how to conduct several \"hands-on\" experiments for laboratory demonstration in the teaching of heat transfer and fluid dynamics. It is an ideal resource for chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and engineering technology professors and instructors starting a new laboratory or in need of cost-effective and easy to replicate demonstrations. The book details the equipment required to perform each experiment (much of which is made up of materials readily available is most laboratories), along with the required experimental protocol and safety precautions. Background theory is presented for each experiment, as well as sample data collected by students, and a complete analysis and treatment of the data using correlations from the literature.\"--Provided by publisher"

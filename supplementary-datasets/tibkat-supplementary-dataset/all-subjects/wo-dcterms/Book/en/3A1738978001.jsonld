            "abstract": "\"Recent research in plant sciences have proved that many of the mechanisms cannot be understood while ignoring the surrounding microbial communities. Plants are challenged due to their sessile life and lack of locomotion which makes them prone to various unavoidable stress conditions. Various plant-microbe interactions result in the formation of plant microbiome and help plants tackle abiotic and biotic stresses. Plant-microbe interactions play a crucial role in plant growth and metabolism. Plants adapt to their terrestrial environment with the help of various microbial communities involved in nutrient acquisition and abatement of various biotic and abiotic factors induced stress conditions. Plants utilize sunlight for photosynthetic reduction of carbon and it acts as energy entry point due to which plant associated microbes have access to both via different ecological associations. Recently it has been found that various beneficial microbes help in plant development, starting from the seed germination to flowering and fruiting. Previously plant-microbe interactions were more or less confined to the investigations of root associated microbes, primarily in the \"Rhizosphere\". However, the microbial community associated with the shoot system of plants has also been found to play a beneficial role in the plant defense and its development. Many of the leaf associated microbes are found to be having an important role in imparting defense against various plant pathogens and abiotic stress conditions by affecting the plant activities. Thus, this gave rise to the concept of plant development along with its microbial community which is collectively known as \"Phytomicrobiome\" and helps the plant in all phases of life. The concept of Phytomicrobiomeis is revolutionizing plant science investigations and helping in the exploration of plant development and defence responses in cutting edge ways. This emerging area will help in increasing the sustainable production of agricultural crops, and better management of plant diseases, therefore, there is an urgent need to spread awareness about the concepts, current challenges and recent developments in the field of phytomicrobiome research and its application in sustainable agriculture\"--",

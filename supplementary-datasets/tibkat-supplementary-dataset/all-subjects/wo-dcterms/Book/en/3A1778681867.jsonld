            "abstract": "Over the last two decades we have seen extensive progress within the practice of neurology. We have refined our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis for both peripheral and central nervous system diseases, and developed new therapeutic approaches towards these diseases. Peripheral neuropathy is a common disorder seen by many specialists and can pose a diagnostic dilemma. Many etiologies, including drugs that are used to treat other diseases, can cause peripheral neuropathy. However, the most common cause is Diabetes Mellitus, a disease all physicians encounter. Disability due to peripheral neuropathy can be severe, as the patients suffer from symptoms daily. This book addresses the advances in the diagnosis and therapies of peripheral neuropathy over the last decade. The basics of different peripheral neuropathies is briefly discussed, however, the book focuses on topics that address new approaches to peripheral neuropathies",

                "This book focuses on two key challenges: the negative impact on property value and higher vacancy risk of pop-up stores. It suggests alternative rental models based on footfall and customer conversion rates and provides a strategic framework for real estate investors to develop and manage pop-up stores. The empirical study emphasizes the importance of data availability, the evolution of market fundamentals, and the potential of the operator model for managing pop-up retail spaces. The retail real estate market in Switzerland comprises about 13.0% of total commercial areas. The growth of e-commerce, accelerated by the COVID-pandemic, is leading to signi\ufb01cant changes in bricks-and-mortar retail. Real estate owners are faced with higher vacancy rates, shorter rental terms, and lower rents. However, there are barriers with e-commerce that prevent it from fully replacing physical stores. While retailers are now seeking \ufb02exible and innovative spaces like pop-up stores, this book sheds light on enhancing pop-up store viability in real estate investment strategies from the point of view of property investors. This textbook has been recommended and developed for university courses in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

I wrote this book with two main goals for you in mind: to see chemistry as you never have before and to develop the problem-solving skills you need to succeed in chemistry. I want you to experience chemistry in a new way. I have written each chapter to show you that chemistry is not just something that happens in a laboratory; chemistry surrounds you at every moment. Several outstanding artists have helped me to develop photographs and art that will help you visualize the molecular world. From the opening example to the closing chapter, you will see chemistry. My hope is that when you finish this course, you will think differently about your world because you understand the molecular interactions that underlie everything around you. My second goal is for you to develop problem-solving skills. No one succeeds in chemistry-or in life, really-without the ability to solve problems. I can't give you a one-size-fits-all formula for problem solving, but I can and do give you strategies that will help you develop the chemical intuition you need to understand chemical reasoning\"--",

            "abstract": "Macrophages are the sentinels of the immune system whose role has evolved beyond providing aseptic conditions to homeostasis, immune regulation, development, and behaviour. These cells have varied ontogenetic origins which reflects in their phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Macrophage functions are fine-tuned by exogenous and endogenous signals and once tweaked, the information is included in their genetic makeup, albeit not indefinitely. Subversion of the macrophage functions is the hallmark of many pathogenic organisms and modulation of macrophage activity is pivotal to many therapeutic strategies. Fascinating and rapid developments in this field have necessitated the maintenance of currency of knowledge. This book provides a current account of information on varied topics in macrophage biology. Literature surveys have been presented in a captivating and lucid language. The contributing authors have also provided brief accounts of their own research. Every chapter provides a future perspective of what more could be achieved in the context of the current knowledge. The book will be of interest to students and researchers in microbiology, immunobiology, translational research, pathology, and related fields",

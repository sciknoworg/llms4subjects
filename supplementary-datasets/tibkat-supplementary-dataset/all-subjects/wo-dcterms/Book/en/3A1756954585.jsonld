                "Learn how to get the most out of ASP.NET Core Identity. ASP.NET Core Identity provides authentication and user management for ASP.NET Core applications. In the world of ASP.NET development, Identity is a complex framework in its own right, with support for a wide range of features, including authenticating users with services provided by Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Best-selling author Adam Freeman teaches developers common authentication and user management scenarios and explains how they are implemented in applications. Each topic, from configuring identity to authenticators and recovery codes, is clearly and concisely presented. And in true Freeman style, each chapter is packed with the essential details you need to be effective. The book takes a deep dive into ASP.NET Core Identity and explains how the most important and useful features work, from the built-in features that can be used for simple applications, through to deep customizations for advanced projects. Structured in two complementary parts, Part I covers how to apply ASP.NET Core Identity to an ASP.NET Core project. You will learn how to set up and configure Identity, how to use the built-in Identity UI package to manage user accounts, and how to use the API to create custom workflows. In Part II, you will learn how the features in Part I are implemented, customized, and more. What You Will Learn Gain a solid understanding of how Identity provides authentication and authorization for ASP.NET Core applications Configure ASP.NET Core Identity for common application scenarios, including self-service registration, user management, and authentication with services provided by popular social media platforms Create robust and reliable user management tools Understand how Identity works in detail and best practices for using it in your projects Construct custom implementations of the interfaces that meet the needs of advanced ASP.NET Core projects This book is for developers with advanced knowledge of ASP.NET Core who are introducing Identity into their projects. Prior experience and knowledge of C#, ASP.NET Core is required, along with a basic understanding of authentication and authorization concepts. Adam Freeman is an experienced IT professional who has held senior positions in a range of companies, most recently serving as chief technology officer and chief operating officer of a global bank. Now retired, he spends his time writing and long-distance running."

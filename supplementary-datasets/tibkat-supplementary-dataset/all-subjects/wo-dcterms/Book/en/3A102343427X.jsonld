            "abstract": "With contributions from many of the leading researchers in the field, the Handbook of Research on Crisis Leadership in Organizations summarizes much of the theory, research, and opinion about various facets of crisis leadership in order to advance this emerging field. It recognizes that crises have become an almost inevitable part of organizational life, and describes how leaders can facilitate people getting through the crisis. -- The Handbook is divided into four parts: attributes and behaviors of the crisis leader; leadership of subordinates during a crisis; managing the present crisis and prevent future crises; and an integration of approaches to understanding crisis leadership. Enough knowledge has been accumulated about crisis leadership in organizations to serve as guidelines for practice, as well as a research base to build on for the future. Leaders must help others get through crises as well as prevent them. -- Researchers in the field of crisis leadership and crisis management will find this important resource invaluable. Academics and students of organizational behavior, industrial and organizational psychology, and management will also find much of interest and might also suggest the book as a valuable addition to their library as an important resource in the field of crisis leadership. Human resource professionals in larger organizations as well as management consultants who endeavor to acquire advanced knowledge about this field will find the practical aspects of keen interest as well.",

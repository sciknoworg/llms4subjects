                "The book serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it bridges the divide between applied civil engineering hydraulics and conventional fluid mechanics literature. Secondly, it is structured as a modular course, allowing for flexible application. The goal is to present information in a clear and illustrative manner, utilizing readily available materials, experiments, and open-source code examples. This is an open access book. The content is accompanied by code examples for open-source software includes descriptive explanations, illustrative experiments and easy-to-understand examples combines Sustainable Development Goals SDG4 and SDG 6: access to water and sanitation, respectively The author Dr. Christoph Rapp was a research assistant at the Chair of Hydraulics and Hydrology and later the Department of Hydromechanics at the Technical University of Munich. After earning his doctorate, he served as the head of the laboratory. In addition to experimental research into complex flows, he devoted himself to illustrative teaching. He received several prizes for this, including the Ernst Otto Fischer Teaching Prize for an innovative teaching concept. In the context of his collaboration with Markus Heinsdorff, he inspires with installation art about water. Christoph is head of the hydropower department of an energy supplier and lectures at Bauhaus University, Weimar . He also teaches at universities in developing countries through the International Knowledge Exchange Association, which he founded (Verein zur F\u00f6rderung des internationalen Wissensaustauschs e.V. ).",

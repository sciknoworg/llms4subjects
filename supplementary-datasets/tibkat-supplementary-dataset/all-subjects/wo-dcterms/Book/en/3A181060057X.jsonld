The strategies and tactics presented, when practiced diligently, can shorten development timelines, help avoid common pitfalls, and improve the odds of success, especially when resources are limited. MEMS Product Development illuminates what it really takes to develop a novel MEMS product so that innovators, designers, entrepreneurs, product managers, investors, and executives may properly prepare their companies to succeed. How to define a MEMS product and create cost models to inform fundraising or budgeting; Implement technical best practices for successful MEMS prototype and product development; Prepare for and successfully execute the transfer of a MEMS prototype to a foundry for volume manufacturing.",

            "abstract": "There are a lot of important issues related to viral hepatitis studies: molecular biology of viruses, laboratory diagnostics, epidemiology, treatment etc. However, there is a number of special textbooks and monographs on the subject. Considering this fact and rather fast progress in our understanding of the problem this book focuses on the important sections of the problem immune pathogenesis of parenterally transmitted viral hepatitis and some aspects of hepatitis diagnostics. Seven chapters were prepared by several groups of researchers to share information and results of studies with specialists working in the field and persons who are interested to learn about the viral hepatitis issue. The Nobel Prize Committee (the field of physiology and medicine, 2011) awarded Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann for their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity whilst Ralph M. Steinman was awarded for his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity. We are proud to say that our book is in line with these discoveries, because 3 chapters cover the problems of innate and adaptive immune response in case of viral hepatitis",

            "abstract": "Chromatography is a powerful separation tool that is used in all branches of science, and is often the only means of separating components from complex mixtures. The Russian botanist Mikhail Tswett coined the term chromatography in 1906. The first analytical use of chromatography was described by James and Martin in 1952, for the use of gas chromatography for the analysis of fatty acid mixtures. A wide range of chromatographic procedures makes use of differences in size, binding affinities, charge, and other properties. Many types of chromatography have been developed. These include Column chromatography, High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Gas chromatography, Size exclusion chromatography, Ion exchange chromatography etc. In this book contains more details about the applications of chromatography by various research findings. Each and every topics of this book have included lists of references at the end to provide students and researchers with starting points for independent chromatography explorations. I welcome comments, criticisms, and suggestions from students, faculty and researchers",

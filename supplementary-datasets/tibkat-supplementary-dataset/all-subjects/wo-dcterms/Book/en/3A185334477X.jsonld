            "abstract": "Literacy education can take place in many locations and periods across the lifespan. Literacy educators require flexibility and a deep toolbox to meet their students\u2019 diverse needs, regardless of whether they work in traditional school and college settings or in other environments with varied populations. Teaching Literacy in Diverse Contexts showshow practical experiences can be used in creative ways to support educator development for teaching literacy in a global context.   Mentorship between a developing literacy  educator and an experienced teacher educator is central to the book, and to the  practical experiences in training or professional development that it focuses  on. Chapters share the creative solutions discovered during mentorship that supported  developing literacy educators to teach with authenticity in a number of  contexts, including the adult learning sector, a rural community in Africa and alongside  parents of very sick children. The authors demonstrate how this can be done in  a sensitive and culturally relevant manner by parents, volunteers and teachers  with varying degrees of experience in both formal and informal spaces.  Together, the chapters build a crucial resource for preparing a broad range of  literacy educators to teach literacy in many contexts where policy on how best  to teach reading and writing to diverse student bodies ebbs and flows",

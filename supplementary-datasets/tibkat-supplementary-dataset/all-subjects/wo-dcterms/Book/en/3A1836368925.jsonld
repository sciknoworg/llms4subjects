            "abstract": "Who speaks when you speak? Who writes when you write? Is it \u201cyou\u201d\u2014is it the \u201cI\u201d that you think you are? Or are we the chance inheritors of an invasive, exterior parasite\u2014a parasite that calls itself \u201cBeing\u201d or \u201cLanguage?\u201d If our sense of self is best defined on the basis of an exterior, parasitical force that enters us from the outside, then the \u201cself\u201d is no longer a centralized or agential \u201cinside,\u201d but rather becomes reconfigured as the result of an \u201coutside\u201d that parasitizes the \u201cinside\u201d-as-host. Rough versions of this model can be found in several traditions of continental philosophy: in Lacan, Derrida, Serres, Kristeva, Foucault, Baudrillard, to name a few. However, the full implications of this ontological model have yet to be addressed: what are its consequences for a theory of subjects, objects, and the agencies that intersect with them? How does this framework alter our understandings of the human and the non-human, the vital and the material?  An off-kilter point of view is required to consider this historical and philosophical situation. Language Parasites argues that the best way to conceive of the \u201cself\u201d or \u201csubject\u201d as something linguistically and ontologically constituted by an aggressive and parasitical outside is by asking the following question: \u201cwhat is the being of a parasite?\u201d In addressing this challenge, Braune combines speculative philosophy with \u2019Pataphysics (the absurdist science, invented by Alfred Jarry, that theorizes a physics beyond both the para and the meta, resulting in the pata). These theoretical collisions betray a variety of swerves that extend to the social (as a parasite semiotics), the cultural (as the invasive force of memes), the aesthetic (as the transition of postmodernism to postmortemism), the linguistic (as found in Saussure\u2019s paranoid researches into the paragram), the poetic (as seen in Christopher Dewdney\u2019s journey into \u201cParasite Maintenance\u201d and Christian B\u00f6k\u2019s attempts to embed a poem in a bacterium), and the literary (as para-cited in Henry Miller\u2019s experience of housing a parasite named \u201cConrad Moricand\u201d). The \u201cvoice\u201d of the parasite can be found in what Saussure calls the \u201cparagram\u201d\u2014the uncanny messages that lurk hidden underneath the written word. And what does the parasite say? Or, does its speech reject human ears?",

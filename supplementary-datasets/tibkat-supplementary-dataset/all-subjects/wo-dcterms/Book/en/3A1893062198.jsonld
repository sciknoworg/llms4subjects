            "abstract": "Asymptotic Methods for Engineers is based on the authors' many years of practical experience in the application of asymptotic methods to solve engineering problems. This book is devoted to modern asymptotic methods (AM), which is widely used in engineering, applied sciences, physics, and applied mathematics. Avoiding complex formal calculations and justifications, the book's main goal is to describe the main ideas and algorithms. Moreover, not only is there a presentation of the main AM, but there is also a focus on demonstrating their unity and inseparable connection with the methods of summation and asymptotic interpolation. The book will be useful for students and researchers from applied mathematics and physics and of interest to doctoral and graduate students, university and industry professors from various branches of engineering (mechanical, civil, electro-mechanical, etc.)",

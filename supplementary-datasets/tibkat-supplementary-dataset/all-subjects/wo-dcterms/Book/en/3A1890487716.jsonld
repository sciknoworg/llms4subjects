            "abstract": "\"Promoting Inclusion and Justice in University Teaching offers a theoretical and practical contribution to ongoing debates concerning why and how we need to expand the goals of education in an increasingly diverse academia to enhance inclusivity and equity. It integrates a wide range of well-designed teaching activities grounded in the principles of transformative pedagogy into university settings to connect in-class teaching to social justice demands. Expert contributors employ an array of constructivist and critical epistemological approaches, including indigenous, anti-racist, decolonial, feminist, and intersectional viewpoints, to conceptualize and elucidate their proposed pedagogical frameworks. Chapters demonstrate why and how theoretical and practical principles of transformative pedagogy can respond to the goal of making higher education classrooms not only more inclusive, but also transformative and empowering spaces for teachers and learners alike. The book addresses a crucial gap in higher education, offering a comprehensive toolkit tailored to both undergraduate and advanced students which encourages learners to create a positive social change. Combining practical teaching methods and grounded pedagogical theory, this book will be a highly beneficial read for scholars and researchers teaching in a variety of fields in humanities and social sciences as well as those specializing in teaching and learning, curriculum and pedagogy, and teaching methods in a variety of disciplines. Its blueprint for increasing inclusion and equity in teaching will also benefit professionals and practitioners engaged in formal and non-formal education settings with adults and youth\"--",

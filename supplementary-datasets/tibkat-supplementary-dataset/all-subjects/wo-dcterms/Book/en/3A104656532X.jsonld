            "title": "Impact of Comprehensive Smoking Bans on the Health of Infants and Children",
            "abstract": "As evidence of the negative effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has mounted, an increasingly popular public policy response has been to impose restrictions on smoking through 100% smoke-free bans. Yet sparse information exists regarding the impact these smoking bans at the state and local levels have on the health of children and infants.  A rationale for expansion of smoke-free laws implicitly presumes that potential public health gains from reducing adult cigarette consumption and declines in adult ETS exposure extend to children. However, if smokers compensate by shifting their consumption of cigarettes from public venues that impose a 100% smoke free ban to smoking at home, then these policies may have a harmful effect on children and infants. This study provides comprehensive estimates of how 100% smoke-free regulations impact the venue of smoking, smoking behaviors, and the health of children and infants. Using models that exploit state- and county-level changes to smoking ban legislation over time, estimates suggest that smoking bans have improved the health of both infants and children, mainly through implementation of more comprehensive bans. Further, we find no evidence of compensatory behaviors among smokers (both smokers with and without children in the household), and actually find that the bans had a positive spillover effect in terms of reducing smoking inside the home - an effect which may further explain the improvement in infant and children's health",

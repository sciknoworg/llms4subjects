            "abstract": "BioPolymers could be either natural polymers \u2013 polymer naturally occurring in Nature, such as cellulose or starch\u2026, or biobased polymers that are artificially synthesized from natural resources. Since the late 1990s, the polymer industry has faced two serious problems: global warming and anticipation of limitation to the access to fossil resources. One solution consists in the use of sustainable resources instead of fossil-based resources. Hence, biomass feedstocks are a promising resource and biopolymers are one of the most dynamic polymer area. Additionally, biodegradability is a special functionality conferred to a material, bio-based or not. Very recently, facing the awareness of the volumes of plastic wastes, biodegradable polymers are gaining increasing attention from the market and industrial community. This special issue of Molecules deals with the current scientific and industrial challenges of Natural and Biobased Polymers, through the access of new biobased monomers, improved thermo-mechanical properties, and by substitution of harmful substances. This themed issue can be considered as collection of highlights within the field of Natural Polymers and Biobased Polymers which clearly demonstrate the increased interest in this field. We hope that this will inspire researchers to further develop this area and thus contribute to futures more sustainable society.\u201d",

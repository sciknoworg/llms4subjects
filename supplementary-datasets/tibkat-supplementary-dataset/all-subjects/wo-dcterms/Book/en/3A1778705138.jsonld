            "abstract": "Supply Chain Management (SCM) has been widely researched in numerous application domains during the last decade. Despite the popularity of SCM research and applications, considerable confusion remains as to its meaning. There are several attempts made by researchers and practitioners to appropriately define SCM. Amidst fierce competition in all industries, SCM has gradually been embraced as a proven managerial approach to achieving sustainable profits and growth. This book \"Supply Chain Management - Applications and Simulations\" is comprised of twelve chapters and has been divided into four sections. Section I contains the introductory chapter that represents theory and evolution of Supply Chain Management. This chapter highlights chronological prospective of SCM in terms of time frame in different areas of manufacturing and service industries. Section II comprised five chapters those are related to strategic and tactical issues in SCM. Section III encompasses four chapters that are relevant to project and technology issues in Supply Chain. Section IV consists of two chapters which are pertinent to risk managements in supply chain",

In the current manufacturing industry, processes and materials are developed with close reference to sustainability issues, with an outward look to optimum production efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Important topics such as the use of renewable energy, reduction of material waste and recycling, reduction in energy and water consumption, and reduction in emissions are all discussed, along with broad coverage of deformation and joining technologies, computational techniques, and computer-aided engineering. In addition, a wide range of traditional and innovative manufacturing technologies are covered, including friction stir welding, incremental forming, abrasive water jet machining, laser beam machining, sustainable foundry, porous material fabrication by powder metallurgy, laser and additive manufacturing, and thermoelectric and thermomagnetic energy harvesting.\"-- Page 4 of cover",

            "abstract": "\"This book introduces the use of bio-waste as a raw material for the preparation of activated carbon (AC) for dyes removal. Activated carbon was derived from assorted materials that have potential to function as a good adsorbent, especially for dyes removal in wastewater treatment. This book was written as a case study to help readers understand the function of AC in each system and approach. This book includes applications of AC derived from corncob; palm tree empty fruit bunch; seashell; eggshell; spent coffee ground; rubber wood saw dust; kenaf fiber and coconut frond in dyes removal and wastewater treatment. The efficiency of activated carbon prepared from various bio-wastes is evaluated by calculating the removal rate of dyes in wastewater. This unique book features eight chapters pertinent to the current situation, as loads of dye effluent are being discharged into the environment. The characterization of the produced AC is analysed using various instrumentations such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The book will attract Eastern and Western researchers and scholars at all levels of degree qualification, industrial practitioners and entrepreneurs in the field of bio-waste\"--",

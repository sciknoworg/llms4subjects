            "abstract": "This book is dedicated to Anna Wierzbicka, one of the most influential and innovative linguists of her generation. Her work spans a number of disciplines, including anthropology, cultural psychology, cognitive science, philosophy and religious studies, as well as her home base of linguistics. She is best known for the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) approach to meaning\u2014a versatile tool for exploring 'big questions' concerning the diversity and universals of people\u2019s experience in the world. In this volume, Anna Wierzbicka\u2019s former students, old and current colleagues, \u2018kindred spirits\u2019 and \u2018sparring partners\u2019 engage with her ideas and diverse body of work. These authors cover topics from the grammar of action verbs to cross-cultural pragmatics, and over 30 languages from around the world are represented. The chapters in Part 1 focus on the NSM approach and cover four themes: lexico-grammatical semantics, cultural keywords, semantics of nouns, and emotion. In Part 2, the contributors connect with a meaning-based approach from their own intellectual perspectives, including syntax, anthropology, cognitive linguistics and sociolinguistics. The deep humanistic perspective, wide-ranging themes and interdisciplinary nature of Wierzbicka\u2019s research are reflected in the contributions. The common thread running through all chapters is the primacy of meaning to the understanding of language and culture",

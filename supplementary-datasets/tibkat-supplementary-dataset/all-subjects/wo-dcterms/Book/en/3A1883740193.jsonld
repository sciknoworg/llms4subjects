            "abstract": "This book contains chapters on wearable biomedical sensors and their assistive technologies for promoting behavioral change in medical and health care. Part I reviews several wearable biomedical sensors based on biocompatible materials and nano and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies in the medical and dental fields. Part II introduces the latest approaches to wearable biosensing using unique devices for various skin targets such as sweat, interstitial fluid, and transcutaneous gases. Part III presents technologies supporting wearable sensors, including soft and flexible materials, manufacturing methods, skin volatile-marker imaging, and energy harvesting devices. This book is intended for graduate students, academic researchers, and professors that work in medical and healthcare research fields, as well as industry professionals involved in the development of wearable and flexible sensing devices and measurement systems for human bio/chemical sensing, medical monitoring, and healthcare services, and for medical professionals and government officials who are driving behavior change in health care",

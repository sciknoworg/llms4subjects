            "title": "Seasonal Energy Storage with Power-to-Methane Technology",
            "abstract": "For a sustainable future, the need to use renewable sources to produce electricity is inevitable. Some of these sources\u2014particularly the widely available solar power\u2014are weather-dependent; therefore, utility-scale energy storage will be more and more important. These solar and wind power fluctuations range from minutes (passing cloud) to whole seasons (winter/summer differences). Short-term storage can be solved (at least theoretically) with batteries; however, seasonal storage\u2014due to the amount of storable energy and the self-discharging of some storage methods\u2014is still a challenge to be solved in the near future. We believe that biological Power-to-Methane technology\u2014especially combined with biogas refinement\u2014will be a significant player in the energy storage market within less than a decade. The technology produces high-purity methane, which can be considered\u2014by using green energy and carbon dioxide of biological origin\u2014as a Renewable Natural Gas, or RNG. The ease of storage and use of methane, as well as the effective carbon-freeness, can make it a competitor for batteries or hydrogen-based storage, especially for storage times exceeding several months",

                "\"Margaret Moore attempts here to offer a comprehensive normative theory of territory. The book provides an account both of the nature of rights to territory and of the nature of the right-holder, considering the arguments that might justify state territory as well as the appropriate relationship between the state, the people, and the land implied by that justificatory argument. After setting out the basics of the theory in the initial chapters, the author then compares her view to the main competing rival views (cultural nationalist and statist) and explains how her view handles the issues of boundary setting, corrective justice, natural resources, immigration and defensive rights. The volume provides the reader with a clear sense both of the existing state of the philosophical literature on territorial rights and of Moore's own views\"--",
                "\"Our world is currently divided into territorial states that resist all attempts to change their borders.  But what entitles a state, or the people it represents, to assume monopoly control over a particular piece of the Earth's surface?    Why are they allowed to prevent others from entering? What if two or more states, or two or more groups of people, claim the same piece of land?    Political philosophy, which has had a great deal to say about the relationship between state and citizen, has largely ignored these questions about territory.  This book provides answers.  It justifies the idea of territory itself in terms of the moral value of political self-determination; it also justifies, within limits, those elements that we normally associate with territorial rights: rights of jurisdiction, rights over resources, right to control borders and so on.  The book offers normative guidance over a number of important issues facing us today, all of which involve territory and territorial rights, but which are currently dealt with by ad hoc reasoning:  disputes over resources; disputes over boundaries, oceans, unoccupied islands, and the frozen Arctic; disputes rooted in historical injustices with regard to land; secessionist conflicts; and irredentist conflicts. In a world in which there is continued pressure on borders and control over resources, from prospective migrants and from the desperate poor, and no coherent theory of territory to think through these problems, this book offers an original, systematic, and sophisticated theory of why territory matters, who has rights over territory, and the scope and limits of these rights.  \"This is a well-written, well-argued book on an extraordinarily important and until recently neglected topic. Moore is impressively knowledgeable of all the relevant philosophical literature and does an excellent job in general of distinguishing her view from those of others such as Miller, Waldron, Kolers, Meisels, and Nine.  Moore succeeds in staking out a new, yet very plausible position-one that avoids the deficiencies of rival theories.\"-Allen Buchanan, James B. Duke Professor, Duke University\"--"

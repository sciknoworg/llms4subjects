                "Essential questions about the skills teachers need for effective classroom practice have raised by researchers such as Shulman, Sch\u00f6n, Altrichter & Posch and Hattie, and discussions still continue. In this context, the anthology combines theoretical studies and practical insights about Reflection from foreign and second language teacher education and professional development. It includes examples of reflective tools, techniques and strategies that can help teachers to (re)think their practices and ensure the quality of their everyday work. The Editors Paul Voerkel received his doctorate in teacher education from the University of Jena, where he currently works as a research assistant and the Chair of German as a Foreign Language. His research interests include teacher education, methodology-didactics, cultural studies, and language policy. Mergenfel A. Vaz Ferreira holds a Ph.D. in Linguistics from the PUC Rio and is an Associate Professor of German Language at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Her main interests are teacher education for additional languages and didactic approaches from a critical and decolonial perspective. Nancy Drescher has a Ph.D. in Applied Linguistics and is a professor of English language teaching for speakers of other languages at Minnesota State University, Mankato. She has teaching experience at the K-12 level and in university, and her research interests include teacher development, educational policy, and reflection.",

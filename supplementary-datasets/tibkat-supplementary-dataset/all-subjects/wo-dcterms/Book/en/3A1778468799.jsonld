We are all responsible for this huge, precious and fragile legacy.The coronavirus pandemic revealed that unexpected events can suddenly change our way of life. In the future, other threats could well pose further challenges to our safety, health and environment as well as our social structures, values and ability to compete on the global markets.How can Europe fulfil its promise if we do not reinvent and redesign the very basis of the European project and come up with innovative and bold solutions for a better and more sustainable future together?We need a \u201cNew Heritage Deal for Europe\u201d, a heritage-led transformation of Europe\u2019s society, economy and environment.Prof. Dr Hermann Parzinger is an archaeologist, historian and cultural heritage expert.

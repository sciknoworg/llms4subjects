            "title": "Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders",
            "abstract": "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) refer to a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative conditions that occur in the workplace or are caused by work activities. WRMSDs affect the muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, peripheral nerves, and supporting blood vessels. These conditions can cause pain and functional impairment and they often result in direct economic costs to both the workplace and the worker. Injuries sustained at work can negatively affect a person's physical and mental health as well as a company's bottom line. This book describes the human musculoskeletal system, including such topics as anthropometry and posture, as it relates to accidents and injuries in the workplace. Chapters discuss such subjects as job standards; risk assessment; direct and indirect costs of WRMSDs; epidemiology, etiology, and pathology of WRMSDs; engineering and administrative controls; risk factor identification; injury management; and education and training. It presents a holistic approach to identifying, intervening, and preventing WRMSDs",

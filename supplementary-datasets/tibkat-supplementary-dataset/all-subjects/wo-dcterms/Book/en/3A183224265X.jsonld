            "abstract": "Quantum mechanics is a part of physics where experiment and theory are inseparably intertwined. This general theme permeates the 2nd edition of this book. It discusses more than 40 neutron interferometry experiments along with their theoretical motivations and explanations. The basic ideas and results of interference experiments related to coherence and decoherence of matter waves and certain post-selection variations, gravitationally induced quantum phase shifts, Berry's geometrical phases, spinor symmetry and spin superposition, and Bell's inequalities are all discussed in this book. Both the scalar and vector Aharonov-Bohm topological interference effects and the neutron version of the Sagnac effect are presented in a self-contained and pedagogical way. Interferometry with perfect crystals, artificial lattices, and spin-echo systems are described in some detail. The book includes the theoretical underpinning as well as connections to other areas of experimental physics, such as quantum optics, nuclear physics, gravitation, and atom interferometry. The observed phase shifts due to the Earth's gravity and rotation indicate a close connection to relativity theory. Neutron interferometry can be considered as a central technique of quantum optics with massive particles. It has stimulated the development of interferometry with atoms, molecules, and clusters. Quantum interference experiments with massive particles have direct consequences on the discussion of epistemological questions since they show explicitly the wave-particle duality, and the entanglement and the contextuality of various parameters governing our modern view of nature",

            "abstract": "Evidence on the impacts of many teacher policies remains insufficient and scattered, and the impact of many reforms depends on specific design features. In addition, teacher policies can have very different impacts, depending on the context and other education policies already in place. Systems approach for better education results (SABER) - teachers is a tool that aims to help fill the gap by collecting, analyzing, synthesizing, and disseminating comprehensive information on teacher policies in primary and secondary education systems around the world. To offer informed policy guidance, SABER-teachers analyzes the information collected to assess the extent to which the teacher policies of an education system are aligned with policies shown by research evidence to have a positive effect on student achievement. SABER-teachers collects data on ten core teacher policy areas to offer a comprehensive, descriptive overview of the teacher policies in place in each participating education system. The eight teacher policy goals are functions that all high-performing education systems fulfill to a certain extent to ensure that every classroom has a motivated, supported, and competent teacher. This report presents the results of the SABER-Teachers tool as applied in Brazil. The report describes the performance of Brazil's education system in achieving each of the eight teacher policy goals. It also contains comparative information from education systems that have consistently scored highly on international student achievement tests and those that have previously participated in the SABER-Teachers initiative",

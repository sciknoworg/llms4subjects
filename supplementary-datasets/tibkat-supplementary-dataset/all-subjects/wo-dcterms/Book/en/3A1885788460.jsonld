            "title": "Relocations : Reading culture in South Africa",
            "abstract": "Relocations is a collection of compelling and original essays by world-renowned as well as emerging writers, artists and thinkers, including novelists Andr\u00e9 Brink, Henrietta Rose-Innes and Imraan Coovadia, poets Gabeba Baderoon and Rustum Kozain, artists William Kentridge and Neo Muyanga, and social activist Zackie Achmat. The essays, which began their lives as part of the Great Texts / Big Questions lecture series at the University of Cape Town, cover a wide range of subjects, from Gandhi to Don Quixote, from opera to visual art, from trout-fishing to Marx and Lincoln. These imaginative explorations all engage in meaningful and often unusual ways with the current landscape of South African culture and creative thinking, reflecting on culture in the wake of decolonisation and asking crucial questions about the place of the arts and humanities in a postcolonial world",

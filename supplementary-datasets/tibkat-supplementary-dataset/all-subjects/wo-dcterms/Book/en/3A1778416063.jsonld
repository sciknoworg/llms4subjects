            "abstract": "Since the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD),  inclusive education is a recurring topic in international and national discourse. Nevertheless, implementation is interpreted and realized differently at national and regional level. Legally, Spain already shifted its focus from segregated to integrative and finally to inclusive education long before the UN-CRPD and has one of the lowest segregation ratios of students with \u201especial educational needs\u201c in Europe. Therefore, Spain is the primary focus of this study, which makes a contribution to international research on inclusion.Due to the qualitative multi-level approach of this study, the subject of research, the consideration of \u201especial educational needs\u201c within the Spanish school system, can be analyzed at different levels and examined in some secondary schools in Andalusia on a regional basis. Therefore, the aim is to answer the question, which role disability plays in the context of the concept of diver-sity to guarantee inclusive education and equal opportunities. The analysis of the institutional change of \u201especial educational needs\u201c since the democratization of the country on the national level  is  the  basis  of  the  study  in  order  to  derive  this  term  historically,  whose  path-dependent  development  points  to  a  high  institutional  stability  both  with  regard  to  segregated  forms  of  schooling  and  to  the  categorization  of  students.  At  the  same  time,  the  investigation  at  school  level  shows  that  asymmetrical  control  in  combination  with  a  high  degree  institutionalization  of  segregated  structures  leads  to  the  reproduction  of  the  legally  established  considerations  of  diversity of students in schools \u2013 although on the basis of diverging difference categories",

                "This book addresses key issues across the field of sustainable urban planning with the aim of providing a unique reference tool for planners, engineers, architects, public administrators, and other experts. The evolution of cities and communities is giving rise to pressing energy and environmental problems that demand concrete solutions. In this context, urban planning is inevitably a complex activity that requires a sound analytical reading of ongoing developments, multidisciplinary analysis of the available tools and technologies, appropriate political management, and the ability to monitor progress objectively in order to verify the effectiveness of adopted policies. Green Planning for Cities and Communities is exceptional in the breadth of its coverage and the way in which it highlights the interactions among different elements. Individual sections focus on strategies and tools for green planning, energy efficiency and sustainability in city planning, sustainable mobility, rating systems, and the smart city approach to improve urban-scale sustainability. The authors draw on extensive practical experience to provide operational content to the theoretical and methodological elements covered in the text, and each section is enriched by informative case studies.",

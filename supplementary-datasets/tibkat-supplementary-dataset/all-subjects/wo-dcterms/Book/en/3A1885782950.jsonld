            "abstract": "Bones represent a fascinating medium that has accompanied mankind in many forms since time immemorial, be it as a raw material, as an object of religious worship or as an object in art and culture. However, less attention is paid to the fact that bones contain a great deal of information about their owners and the circumstances of their lives that can be preserved long after death. The subject of osteology, with its diverse and interdisciplinary subject areas, is dedicated to the task of unlocking this information and giving shape to the beings behind the bones. As an anthropologist at the State Office for the Preservation of Monuments and as a professor at the Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen, Prof. Dr. Joachim Wahl has dedicated his life to osteology and its many facets. This volume has been compiled in his honor and to pay tribute to his work. In a total of 13 articles, renowned experts from the fields of anthropology, archaeozoology and forensics deal with the subject of bones and take the reader on a fascinating journey from the beginnings of the Neolithic Age in Europe to the present day",

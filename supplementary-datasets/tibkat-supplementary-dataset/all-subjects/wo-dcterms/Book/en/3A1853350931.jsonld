            "title": "Chapter 6 Everyday Symphonism : Boris Asafiev\u2019s Soviet Theory of Popular Music",
            "abstract": "Stalin\u2019s political takeover of the cultural theoretical pattern of Bolshevik novyy byt \u2018new public life\u2019 created a powerful myth of the total repression of \u2018bourgeois\u2019 philosophy in the early 1930s. However, since the 1920s novyy byt had also produced directives governing the formation of new theories of ideologically correct \u2018spiritual kul\u2019turnost\u2019 (culturality, being civilized) on the basis of \u2018the best achievements of bourgeois traditions.\u2019 Classical music represented one of these achievements. The chapter sheds light on the idealist philosophical sides of the Soviet conception of kul\u2019turnost. Looking at the musicologist Boris Asafiev (1884-1949) as an intellectual whose theoretical strategies shaped Soviet culture during the Stalin era, the author shows that the Soviet conception of classical music as a symbol of kul\u2019turnost developed from the late \u2018Silver Age\u2019 philosophy of \u2018internal\u2019 spiritual life. Shaped by the NEP-era Bolshevik discourse of novyy byt and Pan-European cultural and musical theories, the conception emerged during the Stalinist kul\u2019turnost campaigns. Asafiev renewed his theoretical setting (theory of Intonation) of the 1920s to suit Stalinist ideological outlines of what a \u2018socialist approach\u2019 to the arts ought to be. However, his theory was one of the evolving ideas that managed to accomplish this in a way that produced interesting scholarly results. His apology of classical music constitute an interesting intellectual history of Russian appreciation of classical music as a proper type of Russian kul\u2019turnost and explains the Soviet understanding of popular music",

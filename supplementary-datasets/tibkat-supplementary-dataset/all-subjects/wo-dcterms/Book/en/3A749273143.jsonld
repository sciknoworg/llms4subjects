            "title": "Wavelets and Their Applications",
            "abstract": "Wavelets and wavelet packets provide a theory analogous to Fourier analysis and tools analogous to coherent state methods. Among their numerous applications, wavelets have been used to data compression in both image and sound processing. They are intimately related to splines, and wavelet applications in spline theory are significant. Wavelets have become a tool in analyzing fractals and iterative schemes associated with dynamical systems. Signal processing methods such as quadrature mirror filters go hand in hand with wavelet techniques in studying a host of communcations problems. The profound issues of classical turbulence are being studied using wavelet packets. Both wavelet packet software and wavelet transform microchips are now available. There are also applications of wavelet theory in theoretical physics, oil exploration, irregular sampling, and singular integral operators. Many of the world's experts in the field of wavelets were principal speakers at the ASI, and their papers appear in this volume. Furthermore, these renowned scientists addressed their talks to an audience which consisted of a broad spectrum of pure and applied mathematicians, as well as a diverse group of engineers and scientists. Thus, the reader has the opportunity to both learn or reinforce the fundamental concepts from the individuals who have created and developed the blossoming field of wavelets, and to see them discuss in accessible terms their profound contributions and ideas for future research",

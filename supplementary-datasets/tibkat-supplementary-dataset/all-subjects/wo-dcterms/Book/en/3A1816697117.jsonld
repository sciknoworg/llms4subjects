            "abstract": "The 2013 Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5) advised that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and said that since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time it affects every country and yet progress in mainstreaming climate change into the policy-making process is patchy. Some countries political leaderships have put in place high-profile climate change mitigation and adaptation plans, with broad participation across government agencies and nongovernmental stakeholders, and with their central finance and planning agencies assuming a key role. In many other countries, however, climate change issues remain the preserve of specialist environmental agencies and there is no framework or mechanism by which climate change issues are systematically taken into account in national planning. This Climate Change Public Expenditure and Institutional Review Sourcebook (CCPEIR) seeks to provide practitioners with the tools and information needed to respond to the public expenditure policy and management challenges arising from climate change. It is a series of notes and supporting materials written to consolidate current research and international experience, to identify emerging practice, and to provide practical and applicable guidance for staff of central finance agencies, development agencies, environmental agencies, and international organizations working on climate change issues",

            "abstract": "Pharmaceutical formulations have evolved from simple and traditional systems to more modern and complex novel dosage forms. Formulation development is a tedious process and requires an enormous amount of effort from many different people. Developing a stable novel dosage form and further targeting it to the desired site inside the body has always been a challenge. The purpose of this book is to bring together scholarly articles that highlight recent developments and trends in pharmaceutical formulation science. Each article has been written by authors specializing in the subject area and hailing from top institutions around the world. The book has been written in a systematic and lucid style explaining all basic concepts and fundamentals in a very simple way. This book aims to serve the need of all individuals involved at any level in the pharmaceutical dosage form development. I sincerely hope that the book will be liked by inquisitive students and learned colleagues",

            "abstract": "\"This book introduces the readers to techniques and methodologies of proteomics to understand the different physiological phenomena in plants and their responses to various environmental cues and defense mechanisms against pathogens. The main emphasis is on research involving applications of proteomics to understand different aspects of the life cycle of plant species including dormancy, flowering, photosynthetic efficiency, nitrogen assimilation, accumulation of nutritional parameters, secondary metabolite production, reproduction and grain yield as well as signaling responses during abiotic and biotic stresses. Its approach is unique, encompassing high throughput and sophisticated proteomic techniques, while integrating proteomics with other \"omics.\" In recent years, several advancements have been made in high-throughput protein technologies creating immense possibilities for studying proteomics on a large scale. Proteomics studies reveal virtually every aspect of cellular function in plant stress responses (salinity, drought, heat, cold, heavy metal toxicity), unraveling possible relationships between protein abundance and modification and plant stress tolerance. Researchers are very interested in exploring novel proteomic techniques to unravel the mystery of plant stress tolerance mechanisms, this book should have a broad audience (not only limited to plant science), novel ideas and new techniques will interest researchers from other fields. Unique - Integrates the branch of proteomics with other omics approaches like genomics and metabolomics, giving a holistic view of the overall omics approaches. This book aims to cover various proteomics approaches for the identification of biological processes, future perspectives, and upcoming applications to identify diverse genes in plants. It presents readers with various proteomics tools for the improvement of plant growth, quality and resilience against climate change, and pathogen infection. The application of the proteomics tools help in crop quality improvement and stress mitigation mechanisms. Enables the researchers in identifying novel proteins that could be used as target to generate plants with improved traits\"--",

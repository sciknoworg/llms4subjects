            "abstract": "The renaissance of Shi\u2019i Islam began in the 9th/15th century when the Ismailis experienced the Anjudan revival and Twelver Shi\u2019i traditions were also renewed. This renaissance gained further strength when the Safavids succeeded in establishing a state in the early decades of the 10th/16th century, making Ithna\u2019ashari Shi\u2019i Islam their official religion. The chapters in this open access book represent the most recent scholarship on the intellectual and spiritual life of the age and discuss what prepared the ground for its appearance as well as its achievements. Although the political and artistic developments of the Safavid era of the 10th-12th/16th-18th centuries have been extensively studied, the complexities of the different groups, movements and strands of thought in the renaissance of Shi\u2019i Islam still remain largely unexplored. The major themes that characterised the Shi\u2019i renaissance are explored, including: popular reactions to messianic movements; the development of legal theories and concepts; the investigation of theological and philosophical problems, above all by the \u2018School of Isfahan\u2019; Shi\u2019i-Sufi interactions and intra-Shi\u2019i relations; the collection of Shi\u2019i hadith and its application in Shi\u2019i exegesis; and the interplay between political considerations and religious beliefs.",

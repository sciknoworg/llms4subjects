Contributors attune to the dialogic and hybrid relations that connect bodies and environments, and to the horizons of imaginative, future-worldbuilding possibilities that they open through acts of transmission, translation, and transfer. Refracting to something other than the body\u2019s own physicality \u2013 to multiple (multidirectional) networks \u2013 the chapters in this volume map and weave an ecosystem of interlacing bodies that are human, animal, vegetal, natural and technological; that are both singular and collective (i.e. a social body); that are situated in both the physical and virtual space; that are mythological and ephemeral; and that express naturecultural entanglements",

            "abstract": "The deployment of 4G/LTE (Long-Term Evolution) mobile networks has solved the major challenge of high capacities to build a real broadband mobile internet. This was possible mainly through a very strong physical layer and flexible network architecture. However, bandwidth-hungry services such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), have been developed in an unprecedented way. Furthermore, mobile networks are facing other new services with extreme demand for greater reliability and almost zero-latency performance, like vehicle communications and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Therefore, industries and researchers are investigating new physical layers and softwarization techniques and including more intelligence in 5G and beyond 5G (B5G/6G). This book discusses some of these softwarization techniques, such as fog computing, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). It also presents use cases showing practical aspects from 5G deployment scenarios, where other communications technologies will co-habit to build the landscape of next-generation mobile networks (NGMNs)",

            "title": "Quantum Chemistry : Molecules for Innovations",
            "abstract": "Molecules, small structures composed of atoms, are essential substances for lives. However, we didn't have the clear answer to the following questions until the 1920s: why molecules can exist in stable as rigid networks between atoms, and why molecules can change into different types of molecules. The most important event for solving the puzzles is the discovery of the quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the theory for small particles such as electrons and nuclei, and was applied to hydrogen molecule by Heitler and London at 1927. The pioneering work led to the clear explanation of the chemical bonding between the hydrogen atoms. This is the beginning of the quantum chemistry. Since then, quantum chemistry has been an important theory for the understanding of molecular properties such as stability, reactivity, and applicability for devices. This book is devoted for the theoretical foundations and innovative applications in quantum chemistry",

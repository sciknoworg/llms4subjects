                "This book discusses the macromolecular characterization of hydrocarbon components and their industrial applications for sustainable future development. It provides efficient integrated solutions and feasible industrial applications for sustainable cleaner and greener future. The book covers recent trends in the use of hydrocarbons such as crude oil, coal and shale, biomass and other carbon materials. Various topics covered in this book include challenges in mature field redevelopment, enhanced oil recovery, optical characteristics of petroleum crudes-surfactants-brine solutions, challenges and issues in processing hydrocarbons, 'coal for future cleaner fuel and chemicals' and 'biomass for fuels and chemicals'. The book is useful for the researchers and professionals working in the area of petroleum engineering. .",

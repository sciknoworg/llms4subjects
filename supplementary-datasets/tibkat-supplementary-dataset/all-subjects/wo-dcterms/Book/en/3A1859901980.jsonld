            "abstract": [
                "This book provides a unique ethnographic approach to the understanding of ethnogenesis in the Chinese context, with a particular focus on how it is being reshaped in the post-2000s era. It reinterprets the Chinese concept of ethnicity, or minzu, by investigating its evolution in relation to the proliferation of media technologies. In an era characterized by digital connectivity, the quest for ethnic identity has taken on new dimensions. Ethnic groups, like the Sibe community from Xinjiang, are now extending beyond the state\u2019s traditional interpretations of minzu. Leveraging the power of media technology, they are articulating and expressing their ethnic identities in new and personalised ways. These developments have led to the emergence of what this book terms \u2018networked ethnicity,\u2019 a fresh manifestation of ethnic identity formation in the era of social media. The pivotal question this book attempts to answer is: How does an ethnic group in China today understand its identity, and what role does technology and media play in that process? This exploration offers a critical perspective on the complex interplay between digital technology, individual agency, and ethnic identity formation. This study will be of interest to scholars of cultural studies, Chinese society, ethnic studies, and media studies, or anyone keen to understand the changing landscape of ethnic identity in the digital age. Lei Hao obtained his PhD in Media and Communications at Goldsmiths, University of London, UK. His research is situated at the intersection of technicity and identity formation, delving into the connection between subjectivity and the use of media technology. His work critically examines how the use of media technology influences the way in which people construct and express their identities. In particular, Lei investigates how these technological dynamics affect the materialization of subject formation. Lei is a Teaching Fellow at the School of International Communications at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. He also serves as a Research Fellow at the Institute for Mobile Studies and the Institute of Asia and Pacific Studies within the same institution.",

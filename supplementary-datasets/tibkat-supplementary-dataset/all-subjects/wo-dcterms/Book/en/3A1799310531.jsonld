                "\u2018Through an in-depth analysis of the evolving financing of the European party system, Wouter Wolfs makes a timely and outstanding contribution to the debates on EU democracy. A must read for students of European politics!\u2019 \u2013 Nathalie Brack, Associate Professor, Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, and Visiting Professor, College of Europe \u2018Wouter Wolfs sets himself a challenging task of deciphering the complex story of party financing at the EU-level. He does not disappoint. Informative and insightful Wolfs has produced an indispensable analysis of this under-researched topic.\u2019 \u2013 Stephen Day, Professor of Comparative Politics and EU Studies, University of Oita \u2018Wouter Wolfs lifts the lid on European political parties and provides new, critical, and crucial insights into their workings. This empirically rich and well-informed book advances our understanding of contemporary Europarties and the challenges of EU-level party politics in general.\u2019 \u2013 Isabelle Hertner, Senior Lecturer, King's College London \u2018This is a meticulously researched, thoughtfully executed and cogently written study. It is central for the understanding of the EU institutions, especially in light of the hopes that generous public funding will help address their democratic deficit. In a turbulent time, this is a timely contribution on an important subject.\u2019 \u2013 Jonathan Mendilow, Professor of Political Science and Global Studies, Rider University, and Chair IPSA RC20 Political Finance and Political Corruption This book provides a comprehensive overview of the party finance regime at the level of the European Union. Based on an in-depth analysis of the interaction between European political parties and their institutional environment, it shows how the Europarties have coped with \u2013 and altered \u2013 the funding rules. Considering the strong democratic aspirations that lay at the origins of the finance regime, the book explores its consequences for party democracy and the rule of law in Europe. This book is valuable for scholars working on the European Parliament, Eurosceptic parties, EU decision-making, (European) party politics and political finance. Wouter Wolfs is Senior Researcher of the Research Foundation Flanders and Lecturer at the KU Leuven Public Governance Institute. .",

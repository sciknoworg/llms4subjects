            "abstract": "\"Sustainable Aviation Fuels discusses the transfer process of aviation to carbon neutral flights, including how to manage the transition period. It also demonstrates how to develop and design a new approach for environmentally friendly air transport with reduced emissions. Covering the full scope of commercialization, market considerations, advisements on investments, and transition challenges of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), the book tackles questions related to the cost of changing fuel types, competitive market models that can exist parallel to the oil industry, and strategies for airlines to implement. It considers reliability requirements for feedstock suppliers and SAF producers and how to avoid feedstock shortages. The book will interest aviation industry professionals, fuel producers, airline fuel buyers, airport operators, and propulsion engineers working on SAF production. Aviation, aerospace, and business students taking courses in propulsion, gas turbine emissions, air transport management, supply chain development, and sustainable energy production will find the book useful as well\"--",

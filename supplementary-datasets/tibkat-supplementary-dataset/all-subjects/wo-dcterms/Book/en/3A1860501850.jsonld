            "abstract": "\"In Moral Minefields, Shai M. Dromi and Samuel D. Stabler take a systematic look at the profound effects moral debates have on sociological research. The authors explore five recent controversial topics in sociology-about race and genetics, secularization theory, methodological nationalism, the culture of poverty, and parenting practices-to show how researchers make decisions about what topics to study and how to engage with them. They present three broad ways in which sociologists respond to moral criticism of scholarly work: while some accept and endorse the criticism, others work out new ways to address these topics that would transcend the criticism, and still others build on the debates to form new, more morally acceptable research. Moral Minefields addresses one of the most prominent questions in contemporary sociological theory today: how can sociology contribute to the development of a virtuous society? Rather than suggesting that sociologists adopt a clear paradigm that can guide their research toward clearly defined moral aims, Dromi and Stabler argue that sociologists already largely possess and employ the repertoires to address questions of moral virtue in their research. They thus shift the conversation away from attempts to theorize the moral goods sociologists should support, and toward questions about how sociologists manage the plurality of moral positions that present themselves in their studies. Moral diversity within sociology, they show, fosters disciplinary progress. The book promises to be of interest to sociologists of knowledge production, of higher education, and especially to sociologists who aim to reach a wider public\"--",

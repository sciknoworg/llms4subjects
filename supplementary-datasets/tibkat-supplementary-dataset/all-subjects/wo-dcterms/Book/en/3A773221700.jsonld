                "Powerful Earthquake Triggers Tsunami in Pacific. Hurricane Isaac Makes Landfall in the Gulf Coast. Wildfires Burn Hundreds of Houses and Businesses in Colorado. Tornado Touches Down in Missouri. These headlines not only have caught the attention of people around the world, they have had a significant effect on IT professionals as well. The new 2nd Edition of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery for IT Professionals gives you the most up-to-date planning and risk management techniques for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR). With distributed networks, increasing demands for confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, and the widespread risks to the security of personal, confidential and sensitive data, no organization can afford to ignore the need for disaster planning",
                "\"Massive Tornado Hits Moore, OK. Mercy Hospital Destroyed in Joplin, MO Tornado. Powerful Earthquake Triggers Tsunami in Pacific. Super Storm Sandy Wipes Out New Jersey Boardwalk. Hurricane Katrina Makes Landfall in the Gulf Coast. Avalanche Buries Highway in Denver. These headlines are all too common these days and it seems storms are getting larger and more destructive. These tragic events impact people's lives forever and the loss of life and the toll on the families and communities is enormous. In the midst of these tragedies, though, is a resilience of human spirit. We pick ourselves up, assess the situation, and carry on. As an Information Technology professional, your job is to provide the technology to enable business to run (or, after a tragedy, to resume). Information technology is in every corner of just about every organization today. In some small businesses, it is as simple as a few servers and a handful of desktops or laptops. In larger organizations, it is as complex as hundreds of applications running on hundreds of servers across multiple load-balanced locations. Regardless of how simple or complex your IT environment is, you need to plan for business disruptions, which can range from a local power outage to a massive, regional event such as a tornado, hurricane or earthquake\"--"

An impressive team of leading international authorities and acclaimed experts provides a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the role and impact of entrepreneurship education in industrially developed and developing countries as well as transition economies. Incorporating a wealth of new, emergent and innovative techniques, this book will allow teachers to effectively encourage future entrepreneurs to realize their ideas and intentions, and to convert them into successful and sustainable small businesses. An excellent addition to current entrepreneurship education literature, this book will be of interest to entrepreneurship teachers, postgraduate and doctoral students, as well as graduate entrepreneurs, for its useful empirical basis, in addition to extensive theoretical and practical knowledge"

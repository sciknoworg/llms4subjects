            "abstract": "Modern engineering often deals with customized design that requires easy, low-cost and rapid fabrication. Rapid prototyping (RP) is a popular technology that enables quick and easy fabrication of customized forms/objects directly from computer aided design (CAD) model. The needs for quick product development, decreased time to market, and highly customized and low quantity parts are driving the demand for RP technology. Today, RP technology also known as solid freeform fabrication (SFF) or desktop manufacturing (DM) or layer manufacturing (LM) is regarded as an efficient tool to bring the product concept into the product realization rapidly. Though all the RP technologies are additive they are still different from each other in the way of building layers and/or nature of building materials. This book delivers up-to-date information about RP technology focusing on the overview of the principles, functional requirements, design constraints etc. of specific technology",

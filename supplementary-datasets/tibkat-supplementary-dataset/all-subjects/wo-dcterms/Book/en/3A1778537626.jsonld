            "abstract": "Nowadays, the Internet plays a vital role in our lives. It is currently one of the most effective media that is shifting to reach into all areas in today's society. While we move into the next decade, the future of many emerging technologies (IoT, cloud solutions, automation and AI, big data, 5G and mobile technologies, smart cities, etc.) is highly dependent on Internet connectivity and broadband communications. The demand for mobile and faster Internet connectivity is on the rise as the voice, video, and data continue to converge to speed up business operations and to improve every aspect of human life. As a result, the broadband communication networks that connect everything on the Internet are now considered a complete ecosystem routing all Internet traffic and delivering Internet data faster and more flexibly than ever before. This book gives an insight into the latest research and practical aspects of the broadband communication networks in support of many emerging paradigms/applications of global Internet from the traditional architecture to the incorporation of smart applications. This book includes a preface and introduction by the editors, followed by 20 chapters written by leading international researchers, arranged in three parts. This book is recommended for researchers and professionals in the field and may be used as a reference book on broadband communication networks as well as on practical uses of wired/wireless broadband communications. It is also a concise guide for students and readers interested in studying Internet connectivity, mobile/optical broadband networks and concepts/applications of telecommunications engineering",

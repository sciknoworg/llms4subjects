            "abstract": "The ecological threat posed by the more than 300,000 tonnes of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after the Second World War is one that demands the urgent attention of the international community. The amount dumped represents more than three times as much as the total reported chemical arsenals of the United States and Russia. The munitions were disposed of in the shallow depths of the Northern European seas - where fishing is actively pursued - in close proximity to densely populated coastlines, with no consideration for the long-term consequences. Despite its vital importance, the issue has never been adequately scientifically analyzed. Munitions dumped in the sea are not covered by the Chemical Weapons or other arms control treaties. The NATO Advanced Science Institute held in Kaliningrad in January 1995, the proceedings of which are reported here, was the first attempt at a comprehensive coverage of the problem of chemical munitions dumped in the sea, due attention being paid to chemical, biological, technological and legal aspects. Audience: While a few parts of the book are highly specialised, most of it will interest the general public as well as policy makers, journalists and engineers. This first publication devoted to the environmental problem at the European scale will be an eye opener for millions who never knew of the highly toxic dumps in their own back yard",

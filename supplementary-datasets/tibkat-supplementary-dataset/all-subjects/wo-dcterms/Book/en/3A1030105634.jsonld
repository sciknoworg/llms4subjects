                "This BASS book Series publishes selected high-quality papers reflecting recent advances in the design and biostatistical analysis of biopharmaceutical experiments - particularly biopharmaceutical clinical trials.  The papers were selected from invited presentations at the Biopharmaceutical Applied Statistics Symposium (BASS), which was founded by the first Editor in 1994 and has since become the premier international conference in biopharmaceutical statistics. The primary aims of the BASS are: 1) to raise funding to support graduate students in biostatistics programs, and 2) to provide an opportunity for professionals engaged in pharmaceutical drug research and development to share insights into solving the problems they encounter. The BASS book series is initially divided into three volumes addressing: 1) Design of Clinical Trials; 2) Biostatistical Analysis of Clinical Trials; and 3) Pharmaceutical Applications.   This book is the second of the 3-volume book series. The topics covered include: Statistical Approaches to the Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials, Collaborative Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation to Assess Causal Effects in Observational Studies, Generalized Tests in Clinical Trials, Discrete Time-to-event and Score-based Methods with Application to Composite Endpoint for Assessing Evidence of Disease Activity-Free , Imputing Missing Data Using a Surrogate Biomarker: Analyzing the Incidence of Endometrial Hyperplasia, Selected Statistical Issues in Patient-reported Outcomes, Network Meta-analysis, Detecting Safety Signals Among Adverse Events in Clinical Trials, Applied Meta-analysis Using R, Treatment of Missing Data in Comparative Effectiveness Research, Causal Estimands: A Common Language for Missing Data, Bayesian Subgroup Analysis with Examples, Statistical Methods in Diagnostic Devices, A Question-Based Approach to the Analysis of Safety Data, Analysis of Two-stage Adaptive Seamless Trial Design, and Multiplicity Problems in Clinical Trials - A Regulatory Perspective",

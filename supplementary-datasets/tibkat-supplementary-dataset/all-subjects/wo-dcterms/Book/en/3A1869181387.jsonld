            "abstract": "If it is true that no one is able to predict the future scenarios in which new generations will need to move, it is also true that we can at least try to hypothesise how to 'equip' them to undertake the great journey towards and through those scenarios. The hypothesis proposed in this volume is that the 'backpack' of the 'traveller towards possible futures' cannot be without two essential tools: firstly, the ability to self-direct and self-regulate one's own continuous learning, enabling and enhancing it with the aid of increasingly advanced technologies; and secondly, knowing how to grasp the peculiarities of the new interaction spaces that are coming into being thanks to those technologies. What can the world of education do in this regard, from this day forward? Certainly not limit itself to dispensing knowledge but rather devote the appropriate amount of time to training students in the mental habit of constantly relocating their learning process in the scenarios and situations that can arise in everyday life on a personal, professional and social level: scenarios and situations that will increasingly develop in so-called hybrid spaces, produced by the intermingling of real and digital spaces and in which formal, non-formal and informal learning processes also tend to merge naturally. This volume discusses hybrid spaces and in particular their capacity to offer an ideal context for seamless learning, i.e. a seamless learning process that goes beyond the traditional patterns of formal education and helps students to become protagonists of their own future",

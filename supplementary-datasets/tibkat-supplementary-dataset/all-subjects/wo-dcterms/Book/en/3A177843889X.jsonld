            "abstract": "This book is aimed at serving researchers, engineers, scientists, and engineering graduate and PhD students of engineering and physical science together with individuals interested in engineering and science. This book focuses on the application of engineering methods to complex systems including transportation, building, and manufacturing, with approaches representing a wide variety of disciplines of engineering and science. Throughout the book, great emphases are placed on engineering applications of complex systems, as well as the methodologies of automation, including artificial intelligence, automated and intelligent control, energy analysis, energy modelling, energy management, and optimised energy efficiency. The significant impact of recent studies that have been selected for presentation are of high interest in engineering complex systems. An attempt has been made to expose the reading audience of engineers and researchers to a broad range of theoretical and practical topics. The topics contained in the present book are of speci\ufb01c interest to engineers who are seeking expertise in transportation, building, and manufacturing technologies as well as mathematical modelling of complex systems, engineering approaches to engineering complex problems, automation via artificial intelligence methods, automated and intelligent control, and energy systems. The primary audience of this book are researchers, graduate students, and engineers in mechanical engineering, control engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and science disciplines. In particular, the book can be used for training graduate and PhD students as well as senior undergraduate students to enhance their knowledge by taking a graduate or advanced undergraduate course in the areas of complex systems, control systems, energy systems, and engineering applications. The covered research topics are also of interest to engineers and academia who are seeking to expand their expertise in these areas.eng",

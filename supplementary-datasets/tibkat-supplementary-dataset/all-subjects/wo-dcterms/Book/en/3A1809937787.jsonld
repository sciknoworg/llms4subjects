                "\"The Enactment of Strategic Leadership authored by Darko Tipuri\u0107 is a singular book that gives a concise description of the phenomena of strategic leadership from the perspective of socially defined constructs. The book represents an original contribution to the field, especially from the perspective of the simultaneous coverage of action and thinking in the strategic leadership domain.\" -- Zolt\u00e1n Baracskai, Professor, Academic Director of Doctoral Program, Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n University, Gy\u0151r, Hungary This Open Access book explores the meaning and roles that strategy and leadership play in our lives. Based on decades of experience, the author contemplates whether we believe strategic leadership exists because it actually exists, or whether it exists because we believe it does? Both answers are true. The author argues that the duality of the essence of strategic leadership is clear. It may appear to be personalised, or it may seem to be an important characteristic of the organization enacted everywhere where there is guidance. In fact, the discussion about strategic leadership raises more questions. In this thought-provoking book, the author puts forward a robust critical assessment of one of the most widely used concepts in management research and practice. Beginning with an ontological and historical discussion around which the concept of strategic leadership has developed, the book continues to discuss the phenomenon of strategic leadership. Utilising a post-modern perspective and by heavily drawing on concepts such as hegemony and ideology, the author then discusses the role of organizational culture and networks, as well as the underlying tensions that come associated with strategic leadership. Darko Tipuri\u0107 is Professor of Strategic Management, Strategic Leadership and Corporate Governance, Head of Organization and Management Department, and MBA Programme director at Faculty of Economics & Business, University of Zagreb, Croatia. He has (co)authored hundreds of scientific papers and books in the field of corporate governance, business strategy, leadership, and business decision making. He is a visiting professor at several universities in the South-East Europe region and a member of numerous academic and professional associations such as European Corporate Governance Institute, Academy of Management, South-East Europe Corporate Governance Academic Network, European Federation of Employee Ownership, Croatian Economic Association, Croatian Institute of Directors, Rotary International, etc.",

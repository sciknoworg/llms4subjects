                "\u201cThis book makes a major contribution to the burgeoning field of social scientific studies on energy. By examining the thorny case of Turkey-EU energy relations, Dicle Korkmaz develops a narrative approach to energy and introduces a framework that utilises insights from the English school theory of IR. From an IR perspective, the book strengthens the treatment of energy and political economy issues within this discipline. From the point of view of social scientific energy research, it strengthens the analysis of the international dimensions of energy relations. The book further contributes to the study of EU-Turkey relations by comparing the energy security positions of the two sides with the same metric (as opposed to perspectives biased in favour of one party). It provides a rich resource for energy analysts interested in the international aspects of energy relations, and for specialists on EU external relations, European integration as well as students of Turkish politics.\u201d (Pami Aalto, Jean Monnet Professor, Head of Unit, Politics Programme, Faculty of Management and Business, Tampere University, Finland) \u201cFor any reader with an interest in EU-Turkey relations, particularly in the energy sphere, this book is essential reading. The author has wide experience in the field and has conducted an in-depth analysis of the development of Turkey\u2019s position in the energy market and what it means for gas supply to Europe. Given the increasing importance of the \u201cSouthern Corridor\u201d and Turkey\u2019s potential role as an important transit route, this is a vital strategic issue for future EU energy security and Dicle Korkmaz provides a thorough analysis of all the key issues.\u201d (James Henderson, Director, Natural Gas Programme, The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, UK) This book explores Turkey-EU relations in the context of natural gas. Utilising the English School theory and narrative policy analysis, the author examines EU narratives on Turkey\u2019s role in European energy security in the sphere of natural gas, as well as narratives of Turkish actors on natural gas pipelines and the liberalisation of the natural gas market. The book discusses the extent to which the positions held by Turkish actors on natural gas and energy security constrain and/or enable its integration with the EU. Accordingly, it compares the narratives of the EU and Turkish actors to ascertain how references to the content and scope of the integration varied between January 2001 and July 2019. In the context of this book, \"integration\u201d does not necessarily mean Turkey\u2019s full membership in the EU. Rather, it refers to different types of relations, which are classified as energy security societies.

                "This book covers challenges and solutions in establishing Industry 4.0 standards for Internet of Things. It proposes a clear view about the role of Internet of Things in establishing standards. The sensor design for industrial problem, challenges faced, and solutions are all addressed. The concept of digital twin and complexity in data analytics for predictive maintenance and fault prediction is also covered. The book is aimed at existing problems faced by the industry at present, with the goal of cost-efficiency and unmanned automation. It also concentrates on predictive maintenance and predictive failures. In addition, it includes design challenges and a survey of literature. Discusses the move towards Industry 4.0 standards and creating a digital twin concept to increase production Presents results and design solutions for industrial standards for IoT Intended for researchers, industrialists and data scientists."

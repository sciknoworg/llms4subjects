            "abstract": "This volume further anchors often abstracted, global ideas like \u201cuniversal decent work\u201d within local situations, everyday work practices, and lived experiences. Relatedly, a historical strength of I/O psychology has been its focus on the diversity of sociocultural values and norms in the workplace, including at national, organizational, and individual levels (for a review, see Carr, 2013). This chapter builds on, but also constructively away from, those foundations. Specifically, this chapter\u2014like the contributions that follow\u2014adds to these sociocultural considerations. We do so by including diversities associated with the various socioeconomic situations of different groups that are omnipresent at the hard edges of the wage, work security, and wellbeing spectra (Carr, 2023). Finally, this chapter and book take a deep dive into \u201cwho\u201d has been systematically excluded from decent work in the past, and how they might be systemically included in our collective and sustainable futures",

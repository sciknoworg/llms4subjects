The book focuses on Sat\u014d\u2019s management of Japan\u2019s relations with the United States and Japan\u2019s neighbours in East Asia, where Sat\u014d worked to normalize relations with South Korea and China. It also covers domestic Japanese politics, particularly factional politics within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), where Sat\u014d, as the founder of what would become the largest LDP faction, was at the centre of LDP politics for decades. The book highlights Sat\u014d\u2019s greatest achievement \u2013 the return of Okinawa from United States occupation - for which, together with the establishment of the non-nuclear principles, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the only Japanese to receive the Prize",

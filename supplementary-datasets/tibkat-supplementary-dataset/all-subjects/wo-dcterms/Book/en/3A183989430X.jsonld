                "Nonlinear Approaches in Engineering Applications: Design Engineering Problems examines the latest applications of nonlinear approaches in engineering and addresses a range of scientific problems. Chapters are authored by world-class scientists and researchers and focus on the application of nonlinear approaches in different disciplines of engineering and scientific applications, with a strong emphasis on application, physical meaning, and methodologies of the approaches. Topics covered are of high interest in engineering and physics, and an attempt has been made to expose engineers and researchers to a broad range of practical topics and approaches. This book is appropriate for researchers, students, and practicing engineers who are interested in the applications of engineering, physics, and mathematics in nonlinear approaches to solving engineering and science problems. Presents a broad range of practical topics and approaches; Explains approaches to better, safer, and cheaper systems; Emphasizes applications, physical meaning, and methodologies. .",

            "abstract": "Nanotechnology is considered as one of the emerging fields of science. It has applications in different biological and technological fields which deal with the science of materials at nanoscale (10-9). On the other hand, biotechnology is another field that deals with contemporary challenges. Nanobiotechnology fills the gap between these two fields. It merges physical, chemical, and biological principles in a single realm. This combination opens up new possibilities. At nanoscale dimensions, it creates precise nanocrystals and nanoshells. Integrated nanomaterials are used with modified surface layers for compatibility with living systems, improved dissolution in water, or biorecognition leading to enhanced end results in biotechnological systems. These nanoparticles can also be hybridized with additional biocompatible substances in order to amend their qualities to inculcate novel utilities. Nanobiotechnology is used in bioconjugate chemistry by coalescing up the functionality of non-organically obtained molecular components and biological molecules in order to veil the immunogenic moieties for targeted drug delivery, bioimaging and biosensing. This book blends the science of biology, medicine, bioinorganic chemistry, bioorganic chemistry, material and physical sciences, biomedical engineering, electrical, mechanical, and chemical science to present a comprehensive range of advancements. The development of nano-based materials has made for a greater understanding of their characterization, using techniques such as transmission electron microscope, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope EDX, and so on. This volume also highlights uses in environmental remediation, environmental biosensors and environmental protection. It also emphasizes the significance of nanobiotechnology to a series of medical applications viz., diagnostics, and therapeutics stem cell technology, tissue engineering enzyme engineering, drug development and delivery. In addition this book also offers a distinctive understanding of nanobiotechnology from researchers and educators and gives a comprehensive facility for future developments and current applications of nanobiotechnology.",

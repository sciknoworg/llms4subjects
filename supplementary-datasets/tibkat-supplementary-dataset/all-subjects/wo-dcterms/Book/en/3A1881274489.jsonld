            "abstract": "\"Current planning and design modes of cities are facing challenges of philosophy and form. Past approaches no longer sustain new demands and call for innovative thinking. In a world that is becoming highly urbanized, the need for a new outlook is propelled by global fundamental changes that touch upon environmental, economic and social aspects. The book introduces fundamental principles of timely sustainable urban design. It pays attention to architecture, integration of natural features, public urban spaces, and their successful use. Readers will benefit by learning new strategies on how cities are transitioning to active mobility by placing the well being of citizens at the heart of planning; making buildings fit nature; supporting local culture through preservation; and including community gardens in neighborhoods among other. Written by a practicing architect, professor, and an author, the uniqueness of the book is in the choice of topics to make it highly contemporary and the meticulously selected international case studies on their photographs and drawings\"--",

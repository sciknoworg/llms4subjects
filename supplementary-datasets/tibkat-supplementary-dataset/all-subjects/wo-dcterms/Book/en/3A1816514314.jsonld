                "\"This excellent study makes an important contribution to our understanding of neoliberalism. It draws together and powerfully analyzes an array of market-oriented approaches, backed by governments and private actors, that have come to shape public discourse around poverty reduction. I know of no other work that so successfully offers such a distinctive account of the impact of neoliberalism, while at the same time providing a model of critical theoretical reflection.\" \u2013Phillip Hansen, Professor Emeritus, University of Regina, Canada. This book examines the foundation and progress of the Rochester Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative (RMAPI). Poverty has once again become a major issue in American cities, and nowhere more so than Rochester, which has one of the highest rates of poverty in the nation. RMAPI was established to reduce poverty, yet in the five years since its formation the poverty rate is essentially unchanged. Analyzing the reasons behind its failure, this book argues that the very nature of the organizational framework is part of the problem, and that RMAPI\u2019s project is caught up with contradictory imperatives of neo-liberal welfare reforms. More than just a study of local interest, the book uses Rochester as a case study to illuminate the limits of the neo-liberal approach to poverty. It will appeal to all those interested in political science, urban politics, community studies, welfare policy and public administration. Brian Caterino is an independent researcher who worked in public media. His research interests include political theory, philosophy of social inquiry, and politics and ethics."

            "abstract": "This open access book challenges international policy \u2018groupthink\u2019 about lifelong learning. Adult learning \u2013 too long a servant of business competitiveness \u2013 should be reimagined as central to democratic society. Young adults, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds, engage more in education and training, and learn more day-to-day at work, if provision is democratically organised and based on enduring and inclusive institutional networks, and when jobs encourage and reward the acquisition of skills. Using innovative qualitative and quantitative methods, the contributors develop a critical perspective on dominant policies, investigating \u2013 across the European Union and Australia \u2013 how \u2018vulnerable\u2019 young adults experience programmes designed to improve their \u2018employability\u2019, and how \u2018skills for jobs\u2019 policies squeeze out wider \u2013 and wiser \u2013 ideas of what education and training should do. Chapters show why some provision works for those with poor educational backgrounds, why labour market and educational institutions matter so much, how adult education can empower and expand people\u2019s agency, and the challenges of using artificial intelligence in lifelong learning policy-making. Several investigate the pivotal role of workplace learning in organisational life, and in learning during \u2018emerging adulthood\u2019. Important comparative studies of workplace learning in the metals, retail and adult education sectors show the role of management, trade unions and social movements in young adults\u2019 learning",

The book shows how successful innovations can be built over time, informs readers about current practice and demonstrates how they can use this work themselves. The chapters show how one research group has worked persistently over 40 years with four visions in mind, of a future where: \u2022 learning is accessible for everyone \u2022 teaching is adapted to meet learners\u2019 needs \u2022 teams can successfully teach any number of students at a distance \u2022 learners engage enthusiastically with STEM learning. Each vision is covered in a pair of chapters: the first brings together four decades of research in the area; the second introduces current work, showing how they are united by a consistent framework and a persistent vision.\"",

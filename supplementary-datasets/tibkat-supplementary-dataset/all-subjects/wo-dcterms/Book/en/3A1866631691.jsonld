            "abstract": "Sylvain Chomet is a multifaceted French artist best known for his feature animation films The Triplets of Belleville and The Illusionist. Although the films have a highly recognized artistic value, the relevant literature is limited to a modest number of articles. This open access book provides the first in-depth analysis of his animation films and his contribution to contemporary animation.   Sylvain Chomet's Distinctive Animation examines important elements of the artist's life, his studies and previous works, along with his influences and important collaborations. Special attention is also paid to the production processes, as well as the historical and socioeconomic context in which they have been created, in order to provide the reader not only with a comprehensive study of the films, but also to highlight their contribution to the advancement of contemporary animation.

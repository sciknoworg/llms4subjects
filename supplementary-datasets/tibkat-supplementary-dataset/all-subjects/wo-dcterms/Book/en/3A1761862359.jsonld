            "abstract": "\"Biofluid mechanics embraces the flow of life. It is intimate and personal and situates at the intersection of engineering, physics, mathematics and biology. The author has dual expertise in fluid mechanics and medicine, and shares this unique perspective for the book's two major goals: (1) provide the student with an understanding of fundamental fluid mechanics and (2) put that understanding into a biological context. The level of the book is aimed at the advanced undergraduate and graduate student. So for most it would be a second course in fluid mechanics, though a novice with strong mathematical experience can benefit as well. The content is derived from class notes developed over many years of teaching the subject at Northwestern University and the University of Michigan. Students from many backgrounds have been taught from these notes, including engineering, mathematics, physics and medicine. With 650 references, the book can also serve as a general reference for biofluid mechanics\"--",

            "abstract": "In these seven stories spanning the Midwest to California, Charles McLeod brings us characters estranged from their homelands and locked in conflict with their past and present selves. In \u201cHow to Start Your Own Midwestern Ghost Town,\u201d an unnamed narrator hatches a plan to capitalize on rural decay. A porn star trying to transition to the mainstream does an interview with a German reporter in \u201cThe Subject of Our First Issue Is Art.\u201d In the title story, a closeted heroin dealer follows a ghostly girl into an Oakland graveyard. And in \u201cRancho Brava,\u201d the conductor of a focus group about corporate salsa keeps getting interrupted by visitors from the Old West. Alternating between the comic, the tragic, and the neurotic\u2014and often all three at once\u2014McLeod\u2019s second collection transports readers from the American mainstream to the dark edges of cities and the heartland\u2019s lost, forgotten towns, into the lives of people trying to decipher if they can escape their pasts, and at what cost",

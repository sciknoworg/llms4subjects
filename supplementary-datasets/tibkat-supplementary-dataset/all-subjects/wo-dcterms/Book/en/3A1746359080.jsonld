                "\u2018Ali Mazrui\u2019s ideas quite often sprang from lived experiences and discourses from which he churned chains of books and articles whose styles were peculiar to himself and came to be known as \u201cMazruiana.\u201d This book finally tells the story of the evolution of this body of knowledge.' \u2014P. Anyang\u2019 Nyong\u2019o, Professor and Kenyan Politician, Kenya \u2018This book offers a unique glimpse of the witty Africanist Ali Mazrui, who was befriended by so many, including major political figures. It is a timely contribution highlighting the overlooked, rich narratives of a thinker of international relations from the global south.' \u2014Jacqueline Anne Braveboy-Wagner, Professor, The City University of New York, USA \u2018Ali Mazrui\u2019s remarkable corpus lives, and Seifudein Adem interprets it for today when its salience is undeniable around race, religion etc. Adem\u2019s decade with the maestro maximizes his book\u2019s insights for Africa and the world as both are in flux.' \u2014Timothy M. Shaw, Adjunct Professor, Carleton University and University of Ottawa, Canada This book introduces Ali Mazrui\u2019s delightfully stimulating scholarship about intercultural relations, calling it Postcolonial Constructivism, and shares elements of his intellectual vitality in an original way. It begins with a chronicle of Mazrui\u2019s eventful, sixty-year journey as a scholar of International Relations. It then proceeds to present some of the most remarkable yet least remarked up on features of his intellectualism, including his paradoxes, his perceptive typologies, his neologisms as well as his interactions with historical figures. The book draws on materials which were either unavailable until now or were found scattered in time and space. Designed as an invitation to a wider audience to the supermarket of Mazrui\u2019s ideas, this book also seeks to underscore the timeliness and possible durability of many of his observations about intercultural relations. Thorough, comprehensive and up-to-date, this book is a concise account of the core of Mazrui\u2019s vast body of work. Seifudein Adem is Professor of Global Studies, Doshisha University, Japan, and Research Associate at the Ali Mazrui Center for Higher Education Studies, University of Johannesburg, South Africa. Previously he was Associate Director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies, Binghamton University, USA. ."

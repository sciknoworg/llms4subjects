            "abstract": "The 21st century ushered in a new era of technology that has been reshaping everyday life, simplifying outdated processes, and even giving rise to entirely new business sectors. Today, contemporary users of products and services expect more and more personalized products and services that can meet their unique needs. In that sense, it is necessary to further develop existing methods, adapt them to new applications, or even discover new methods. This book provides a thorough review of some methods that have an increasing impact on humanity today and that can solve different types of problems even in specific industries. Upgrading with Fourier Transformation gives a different meaning to these methods that support the development of new technologies and have a good projected acceleration in the future",

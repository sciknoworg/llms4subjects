            "abstract": "A textbook that offers a unified treatment of the applications of hydrodynamics to marine problems.The applications of hydrodynamics to naval architecture and marine engineering expanded dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s. This classic textbook, originally published in 1977, filled the need for a single volume on the applications of hydrodynamics to marine problems. The book is solidly based on fundamentals, but it also guides the student to an understanding of engineering applications through its consideration of realistic configurations. The book takes a balanced approach between theory and empirics, providing the necessary theoretical background for an intelligent evaluation and application of empirical procedures. It also serves as an introduction to more specialized research methods. It unifies the seemingly diverse problems of marine hydrodynamics by examining them not as separate problems but as related applications of the general field of hydrodynamics. The book evolved from a first-year graduate course in MIT's Department of Ocean Engineering. A knowledge of advanced calculus is assumed. Students will find a previous introductory course in fluid dynamics helpful, but the book presents the necessary fundamentals in a self-contained manner. The 40th anniversary of this pioneering book offers a foreword by John Grue.Contents Model Testing \u2022 The Motion of a Viscous Fluid \u2022 The Motion of an Ideal Fluid \u2022 Lifting Surfaces \u2022 Waves and Wave Effects \u2022 Hydrodynamics of Slender Bodies",

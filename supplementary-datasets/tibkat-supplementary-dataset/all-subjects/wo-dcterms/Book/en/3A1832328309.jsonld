            "abstract": "Due to advent of sensor technology, hyperspectral imaging has become an emerging technology in remote sensing. Many problems, which cannot be resolved by multispectral imaging, can now be solved by hyperspectral imaging. The aim of this Special Issue \"Hyperspectral Imaging and Applications\" is to publish new ideas and technologies to facilitate the utility of hyperspectral imaging in data exploitation and to further explore its potential in different applications. This Special Issue has accepted and published 25 papers in various areas, which can be organized into 7 categories with the number of papers published in every category included in its open parenthesis. 1. Data Unmixing (2 papers)2. Spectral variability (2 papers)3. Target Detection (3 papers)4. Hyperspectral Image Classification (6 papers)5. Band Selection (2 papers)6. Data Fusion (2 papers)7. Applications (8 papers) Under every category each paper is briefly summarized by a short description so that readers can quickly grab its content to find what they are interested in",

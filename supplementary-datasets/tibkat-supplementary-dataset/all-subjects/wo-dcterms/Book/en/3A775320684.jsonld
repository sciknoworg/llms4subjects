            "abstract": "Feedback Control Systems: A Fast Track Guide for Scientists and Engineers is an essential reference tool for: Electrical, mechanical and aerospace engineers who are developing or improving products, with a need to use feedback control systems. Faculty and graduate students in the fields of engineering and experimental science (e.g., physics) who are building their own high-performance measuring/test arrangements. Faculties teaching laboratory courses in engineering and measurement techniques, and the students taking those courses. Practising engineers, scientists, and students who need a quick intuitive education in the issues related to feedback control systems. Key features of Feedback Control Systems: The contents and the layout of the book are structured to ensure satisfactory proficiency for the novice designer. The authors provide the reader with a simple yet powerful method for designing control systems using several sensors or actuators. It offers a comprehensive control system troubleshooting and performance testing guide. From the reviewers: Control systems are ubiquitous and their use would be even more widespread if more people were competent in designing them. This book will play a valuable role in expanding the cadre of competent designers. This is a book that needed to be written, and its presentation is different from any other book on controls intended for a wide community of engineers and scientists. The book breaks the common clich\u00e9 of style in the control literature that tends toward mathematical formality. Instead, the emphasis is on intuition and practical advice. The book contains a very valuable and novel heuristic treatment of the subject. . one of the best examples of a book that describes the design cycle. The book will help satisfy the demand among practising engineers for a good introduction to control systems",

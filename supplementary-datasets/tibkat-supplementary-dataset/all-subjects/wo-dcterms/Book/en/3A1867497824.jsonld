            "abstract": "\"Since prehistoric times, humans have invented ways to simplify daily activities to improve productivity. The most recent milestone in this journey is Robotic Process Automation (RPA), helping to build software robots that can be leveraged to automate mundane and repetitive tasks that can be labor-intensive and prone to errors. In recent years, RPA has been integrated with emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to create what is referred to as Intelligent Automation (IA), emulating human actions and decision-making abilities. This book addresses the critical questions about the rise, usage and future of IA practices. This book is structured by general personas considered as its primary target audience, ranging from: - Early-stage practitioners seeking to learn effective management of IA programs - Established IA Practitioners seeking to drive maturity and scale - Business leaders seeking to understand how to drive business value using IA - Practitioners or academicians seeking to collaborate This book is strongly recommended for practitioners seeking to plan, implement, and scale Intelligent Automation practices in their organization and for researchers and students who intend to study strategy, implementation, and management of Intelligent Automation practice to accelerate the digital transformation agenda\"--",

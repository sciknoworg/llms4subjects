            "abstract": "\"This book aims at providing a deep insight into the energy usage in the energy intensive metal industry and the methodology for efficiency assessment. Various methodologies for energy audit are described along with concept level analysis for minimum energy design. Apart from the technical and engineering analysis, the book also describes management aspects such as energy management system and financial, environmental, and social analysis leading to development of a comprehensive plan for implementation of energy efficiency and conservation in industries. Barriers to investment in energy efficiency and conservation is discussed based on review of global and Indian case studies. Features : details fundamental principles driving the energy consumption in an industrial set-up backed with illustrative examples, explains various alternative methods for discovery of energy efficiency and conservation projects, focusses on the metal producing and processing facilities with a focus on the environmental quality, supports maximum digitization of the energy audit assessment and report preparation processes, includes global case studies and the tutorials at the end of the corresponding chapters. This book aims at researchers, professionals and graduate students in Thermodynamics, Manufacturing, Thermal Engineering, Energy Engineering, Energy Efficiency and Energy Processes Especially in Metal Industry\"--",

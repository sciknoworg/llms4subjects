            "abstract": "Min\u00f3y is a rescue operation with several life rafts. Min\u00f3y-the-book provides an introduction and overview to the important noise music artist Min\u00f3y \u2014 the pseudonym of American electronic art musician and sound artist Stanley Keith Bowsza (1951-2010). Min\u00f3y\u2019s audio compositions, often conjuring up an enigmatic world of almost dreadful depth, earned him a key position in the homemade independent cassette culture scene of the 1980s.  Min\u00f3y-the-CD (available HERE) makes available nine of Min\u00f3y\u2019s audio compositions that span the years 1985 to 1993. These were drawn from recently discovered archival material and selected by the editor and artistic director of the project, Joseph Nechvatal, in collaboration with composer Phillip B. Klingler (PBK). Klingler (co-producer and sound engineer) houses the Min\u00f3y archive and has re-mastered the tracks, most of which have never been heard before (it was thought that Min\u00f3y stopped recording in 1992).  Min\u00f3y-the-book contains two written monograms of Min\u00f3y, one by close friend Amber Sabri and one by artist and art theoretician Joseph Nechvatal. There are three additional essays by Nechvatal, the first of which, \u201cThe Obscurity of Min\u00f3y,\u201d recounts the history of the recovery of the audio material from obscurity. In the subsequent essays (\u201cThe Aesthetics of an Obscure Monster Sacr\u00e9\u201d and \u201cHyper Noise Aesthetics\u201d), Nechvatal reflects on the artistic benefits of obscurity and situates Min\u00f3y\u2019s deep droning palimpsest soundscapes within an original aesthetic-theoretical context of an obscure monster sacr\u00e9, and also examines Min\u00f3y\u2019s legacy in terms of current aesthetic responses to the surveillance state, couching Min\u00f3y\u2019s mysterious and excessive compositions in terms of a general art of noise. In total, Min\u00f3y\u2019s work undergoes a critical intricacy in terms of a contemporary art practice engaged in the fragile balance between production of, and resistance to, perceptibility. Nechvatal brings a subversive reading to Min\u00f3y\u2019s work by presenting it as a form of hyper-noise artistic gazing, based in the flipping of figure and ground. The book also contains sixty black and white portrait images from the Min\u00f3y as Haint as King Lear series that photographer Maya Eidolon (Amber Sabri) created before his death in collaboration with Min\u00f3y (then known as Haint) and Stuart Hass (Min\u00f3y\u2019s lifetime partner)",

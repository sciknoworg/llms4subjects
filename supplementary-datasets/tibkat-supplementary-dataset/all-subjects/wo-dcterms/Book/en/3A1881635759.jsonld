            "abstract": "AUTOMATION IN THE WELDING INDUSTRY This volume serves as a multidimensional perspective of welding practices in Industry 5.0 from the perspective of automation, digitization, digital twins, cobots, virtual reality, augmented reality, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and IoT ranging from rudiments to advanced applications. This book introduces the concept of Industry 5.0 in welding technologies, where the human brain collaborates with robots to achieve rapid productivity and economic efficiency. It presents the latest information on adapting and integrating Industry 5.0 in welding industries through critical constituents such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), digital twin, augmented and virtual reality (AR & VR), and collaborative robots (Cobots), towards intelligent welding systems. The chapter authors have comprehensively addressed the issues related to welding industries such as a shortage of welders, challenges in critical applications, creating defect-free and quality products through real-time monitoring, feedback systems, and in situ adjustments, etc. The utilization of cobots in welding technology is addressed in real-world problems to move towards a green welding environment (i.e., minimal fumes with less shielding gas) and thereby, less energy consumption. Two or more welding processes are combined to form a hybrid process where the compatibility of existing materials and novel materials can be used in 3D, 4D, and 5D printing of complex geometries. Audience Engineering research scholars, industry welding, and additive manufacturing groups. A diverse group of industries will be interested in this book, such as medical, automotive, construction, pipeline, shipping, aerospace, etc",

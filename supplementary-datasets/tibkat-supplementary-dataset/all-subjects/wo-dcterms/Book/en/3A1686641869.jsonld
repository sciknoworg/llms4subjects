                "Start solving world issues by beginning small with simple Rasperry Pi projects. Using a free IoT server; tackle fundamental topics and concepts behind the Internet of Things. Image processing and sensor topics aren\u2019t only applicable to the Raspberry Pi. The skills learned in this book can go own to other applications in mobile development and electrical engineering. Start by creating a system to detect movement through the use of a PIR motion sensor and a Raspberry Pi board. Then further your sensor systems by detecting more than simple motion. Use the MQ2 gas sensor and a Raspberry Pi board as a gas leak alarm system to detect dangerous explosive and fire hazards. Train your system to send the captured data to the remote server ThingSpeak. When a gas increase is detected beyond a limit, then a message is sent to your Twitter account. Having started with ThingSpeak, we\u2019ll go on to develop a weather station with your Raspberry Pi. Using the DHT11 (humidity and temperature sensor) and BMP085 (barometric pressure and temperature sensor) in conjunction with ThingSpeak and Twitter, you can receive realtime weather alerts from your own meterological system! Finally, expand your skills into the popular machine learning world of digital image processing using OpenCV and a Pi. Make your own object classifiers and finally manipulate an object by means of an image in movement. This skillset has many applications, ranging from recognizing people or objects, to creating your own video surveillance system. With the skills developed in this book, you will have everything you need to work in IoT projects for the Pi. You can then expand your skills out further to develop mobile projects and delve into interactive systems such as those found in machine learning. What You'll Learn Work with ThingSpeak to receive Twitter alerts from your systems Cultivate skills in processing sensor inputs that are applicable to mobile and machine learning projects as well Incorporate sensors into projects to make devices that interact with more than just code Who This Book Is For Hobbyists and makers working robotics and Internet of Things areas will find this book a great resource for quick but expandable projects. Electronics engineers and programmers who would like to expand their familiarity with basic sensor projects will also find this book helpful.",

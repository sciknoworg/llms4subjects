            "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been an increased interest in fractional differential equations, inclusions, and inequalities, as they play a fundamental role in the modeling of numerous phenomena, in particular, in physics, biomathematics, blood flow phenomena, ecology, environmental issues, viscoelasticity, aerodynamics, electrodynamics of complex medium, electrical circuits, electron-analytical chemistry, control theory, etc. This book presents collective works published in the recent Special Issue (SI) entitled \"Fractional Differential Equation, Inclusions and Inequalities with Applications\" of the journal Mathematics. This Special Issue presents recent developments in the theory of fractional differential equations and inequalities. Topics include but are not limited to the existence and uniqueness results for boundary value problems for different types of fractional differential equations, a variety of fractional inequalities, impulsive fractional differential equations, and applications in sciences and engineering",

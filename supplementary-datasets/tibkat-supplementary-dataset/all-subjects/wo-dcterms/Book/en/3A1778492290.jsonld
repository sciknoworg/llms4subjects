            "abstract": "A vast amount has been written about NIV, including books and guidelines hence we thought to produce a book called \"\"Noninvasive Ventilation in Medicine - Recent Updates\"\" to cover the untouched components of such this machine. In this book, we tried to include advances in the NIV and the how NIV could be used in synchrony with the mechanical ventilator including a weaning stage. The clinical scope of NIV is changing day-to-day and its rapidly emerging and constantly changing field includes many more indications of utilization of NIV. The current book contains a rich extract from the masters in the NIV field who have vast experience of NIV in areas other than conventional indications and would like to share their experience with all of the readers. Various challenges in NIV patient care include noncompliance, confused, hypercapnic patient or small children coping with a mask, avoiding interface leaks, and balancing ventilatory needs with patient tolerance",

            "abstract": "Implementing blockchain benefits various construction management processes, such as securing payments, enabling traceable design process, and enhancing information transparency in supply chain. However, blockchain implementation in construction is still in its infancy due to weak functionality of smart contracts, which are self-enforceable programs allowing iteration between external data and blockchain. In the context of construction management that embraces complex and dynamic business processes, smart contracts are currently designed based on specific and isolated functional requirements without considering the connection and execution logic between these functions. It leads to inefficient collaboration and even execution errors, thereby corrupting data quality and even causing business failure. Therefore, this paper proposes a Blockchain-BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) integrated (BBI) framework for construction management. The framework poses two contributions. First, a BPMN-driven method is developed to design smart contracts supporting executing linked and logically connected business activities. Second, an access control strategy is integrated into smart contracts to safeguard the accessibility of sensitive business data in a blockchain environment. The BBI framework is validated in an actual BIM design collaboration scenario, and results show its feasibility and computational performance are acceptable. Several aspects for improvement and future directions are discussed in the end",

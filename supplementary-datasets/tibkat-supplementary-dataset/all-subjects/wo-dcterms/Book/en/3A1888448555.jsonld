            "title": "Physics of elasticity and crystal defects",
            "abstract": "\"Mechanical properties of crystalline materials are almost always dominated by the defects within them. The ability to shape metals into pipes, girders and furniture stems from the generation, motion and interaction of these defects. Defects are also the agents of chemical changes within crystals, enabling mass transport by atomic diffusion and changes of phase. Defects distort the crystal and these distortions enable defects to interact over large distances. The theory of elasticity is used to describe these interactions. Assuming no familiarity with the theory this book introduces the reader to linear elasticity and its application to point defects, dislocations, inclusions and cracks. A unique feature of the book is the attention given to the atomic structure of defects and its influence on their properties and their elastic fields. Where it is available brief biographical information is provided about prominent contributors to the field. This text-book is written for postgraduate students in physics, engineering and materials science. It is very likely that even those students with some knowledge of elasticity and defects will find much that is new to them in this book. There are exercises to help the student check their understanding as they work through each chapter. The student is guided through more advanced problems at the end of each chapter. Detailed solutions to all exercises and problems included in this second edition. The last chapter describes five technologically important areas requiring fundamental research, with suggestions for possible PhD projects\"--",

                "The first comprehensive resource on software and computing innovations in control technology New developments in software and information technology are reinvigorating the control engineering community, raising expectations of dramatic improvements in the performance, safety, design time, and verification and validation of control systems. In concert with these developments, synergies between computer science and control are enabling futuristic innovations in autonomous, embedded, and adaptive systems, uninhabited air vehicles and robots. Software-Enabled Control: Information Technology for Dynamical Systems offers a clear and thorough presentation of computer-enabled developments in control engineering as they relate to autonomous vehicle applications. The contributions range over software architectures, online modeling and control, and hybrid dynamical systems.; Some of the novel topics covered in this volume include: Open-system platforms that greatly simplify the real-time implementation of complex algorithms Control middleware for exploiting the capabilities afforded by the advances in computing technologies New algorithms and implementations of model-predictive control and state and model estimation Syntheses of intelligent control methodologies with modern control science, within software-enabled frameworks Tools and algorithms for hybrid dynamics, integrating the discrete event and continuous time aspects that have traditionally been considered separately Safety-assured control design for single and multiple vehicles Architectures and strategies for failure detection, fault tolerance, and control reconfiguration Unique in its focus and broad in scope, Software-Enabled Control: Information Technology for Dynamical Systems offers an important resource for researchers and practitioners who are exploring the frontiers of control engineering, as well as for graduate and undergraduate students seeking entrance into this exciting and visionary community"

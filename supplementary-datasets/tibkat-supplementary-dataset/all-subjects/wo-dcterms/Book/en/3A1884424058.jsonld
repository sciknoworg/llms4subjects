            "abstract": "\"This monograph offers a comprehensive exposition of the theory surrounding time-fractional partial differential equations, featuring recent advancements in fundamental techniques and results. The topics covered encompass crucial aspects of the theory, such as well-posedness, regularity, approximation, and optimal control. The book delves into the intricacies of fractional Navier-Stokes equations, fractional Rayleigh-Stokes equations, fractional Fokker-Planck equations, and fractional Schr\u00f6dinger equations, providing a thorough exploration of these subjects. Numerous real-world applications associated with these equations are meticulously examined, enhancing the practical relevance of the presented concepts. The content of this monograph reflects the culmination of the author's research endeavors, as well as collaborative contributions from experts over the past five years. Rooted in the latest advancements, it not only serves as a valuable resource for understanding the theoretical foundations but also lays the groundwork for delving deeper into the subject and navigating the extensive research landscape. Geared towards researchers, graduate students, and PhD scholars specializing in differential equations, applied analysis, and related research domains, this monograph facilitates a nuanced understanding of time-fractional partial differential equations and their broader implications\"--",

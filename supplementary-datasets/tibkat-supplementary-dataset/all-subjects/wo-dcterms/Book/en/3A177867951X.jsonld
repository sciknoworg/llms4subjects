            "title": "Pulmonary Embolism",
            "abstract": "Pulmonary embolism is a serious, potentially life-threatening cardiopulmonary disease that occurs due to partial or total obstruction of the pulmonary arterial bed. Recently, new improvement occurred in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The aim of this disease is to re-review pulmonary embolism in the light of new developments. In this book, in addition to risk factors causing pulmonary embolus, a guide for systematic approaches to lead the risk stratification for decision making is also presented. In order to provide a maximum length of active life and continuation of functional abilities as the aim of new interventional gerontology, the risk factors causing pulmonary embolus in elderly individuals are evaluated, and the approach to prevention and treatment are defined. The risk of the development of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, combined with obesity due to immobility, the disease of this era, irregular and excessive eating, and treatment management are highlighted. Non-thrombotic pulmonary emboli are also covered and an attempt is made to constitute an awareness of this picture that can change the treatment and prognosis of the disease to a considerable extent. In addition to the pathophysiological definition of pulmonary embolus, the priority goal of quick and definitive diagnosis is emphasized, and diagnostic strategies are discussed in the book. A numerical analysis of the vena cava filters, which is a current approach to prevent pulmonary emboli recurrences, is presented in the last chapter",

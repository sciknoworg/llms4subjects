            "abstract": "Medical imaging informatics play an important role in the effectiveness of present-day healthcare systems. Advancement of artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and internet of things technologies contribute greatly to various healthcare applications. Artificial intelligence techniques are contributing to improvements with traditionally human-based systems and ensuring that the accuracy of prediction and diagnosis is being continually enhanced. The development of reliable and accurate healthcare models is becoming ever more possible with the help of machine learning and deep learning technologies. Artificial intelligence has the power to solve many complex problems in medical imaging and is a technology that will help to design the future of many healthcare systems. This edited book highlights and addresses various issues in medical imaging and provides viable solutions utilising artificial intelligence and big data tools. This book discusses techniques, algorithms, and tools which help build and develop research practices, platforms, and applications in medical image informatics. Medical image enhancement, big data analytics and artificial intelligence models are discussed with relation to applications in the detection of cancer, autism, allergies and diabetes. The design and development of internet of medical things and virtual reality tools for mental health disorders are also explored. This book is suitable reading for researchers and scientists, in both academia and industry, working in computer science and engineering, machine learning, image processing, and healthcare technologies. Those in aligned professions, such as healthcare practitioners, administrators, designers and developers may also find the subject matter of interest.",

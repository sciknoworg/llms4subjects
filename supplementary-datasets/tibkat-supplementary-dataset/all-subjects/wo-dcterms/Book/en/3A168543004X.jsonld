            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, This book examines the chemistry and mode of action of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and plant growth regulators. It follows crop protection strategies from early discoveries to the present day, emphasising the biochemical targets of the compounds discussed. Chemistry and Mode of Action of Crop Protection Agents provides an in-depth, yet easy to read and understand, review of the major classes of pesticides, explaining also the basis of their activity and selectivity. Throughout, there are many references to allow the reader to pursue areas of special interest, and each chapter contains questions to ensure that the text has been understood. This is the first book on the mode of action of pesticides to have been published in over ten years, and as such will have a very wide audience. It is aimed primarily at graduate level but will also be relevant to the needs of some sixth form and undergraduate courses, as well as to industrialists and advisors in the field of crop protection",

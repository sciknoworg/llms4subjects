            "title": "Rights, rivers and the quest for qater commons : the case of Bangladesh",
            "abstract": "Right to water may sound novel and somewhat dramatic, yet it has been central to the quest of human civilization for thousands of years. One of the earliest references to water as \u2018common property\u2019 can be found in the Jewish laws as early as 3000 BCE.Similar views are also found in Islam. In fact, the Arabic word for Islamic law - shari\u2019ah - originally meant \u201cthe place from which one descends to water.\u201dSince water is a gift from the divine to all living beings, sharing water is regarded as holy duty. This is found across religions, regions, societies, and communities, from New Zealand to Nigeria, from Bangladesh to Brazil. But then, what transformed the divine sanction? What led to the negation of the \u2018commons,\u2019 with sharing of the riverine water across territorial boundaries suffering the most?The answer probably lies as much as in the politics of safeguarding one\u2019s personal or national interests as it is in the limitations imposed by our disciplinary understanding of things.In this context, a thorough reexamination, even reconceptualization,of some of the core issuesis required. Firstly, the concept of water needs to be understood not as H2O, as it is done in physical sciences,but as H2OP4. That is, the meaning of water in social sciences must include not only \u2018twice hydrogen plus oxygen\u2019 but also four P\u2019s - pollution, power, politics and profit. This is not to discount the \u2018science\u2019 in the conceptualization of water but rather to add elements central to social sciences. Secondly, the concept of river needs to be redefined and understood not as a carrier of water, as assumedin most of theWestern languages, but as \u2018nadi,\u2019 a flow consisting of prana (life), shakti (power), and atman (soul), as etymologically definedin most of the South Asian languages. This comes closer to what critical hydrologists would say, WEBS, that is, a \u2018river\u2019 consists of water, energy, biodiversity and sediment. In this light, any fragmentation of transboundary river waterin the name of \u2018sharing\u2019becomes an unworkable option, unless of course a mechanism is found to \u2018share\u2019the water of the river along with its energy, biodiversity and sediment, and that again, without distorting and harming the life of the river! Thirdly, the subject of \u2018water commons\u2019needs to be approached from the standpoint of \u2018rights\u2019 of both human andriver. This is to flag the notion that nature, including rivers, has \u2018rights\u2019just like humans, although their manifestations may be different. In fact, empowered humans, particularly those in control of the state, have more \u2018responsibility\u2019 than \u2018rights\u2019 in dissuading themselves and others from creating conditions of human wrongs, not only against fellow human beings but also against nature. Finally, if the \u2018rights\u2019 ofhumans are to be ensuredthen there is an urgent need to reconceptualize and mainstream the human as a multiverse being. This is because humans are not only political beings but also economic, cultural, ecological, technological, and psychological beings. In this light, if conflicts are to be contained then humans need to be empowered in all possible areasof life \u2013 politics, economics, ecology, culture, technology, and psychology. This would certainly require empowering each and every person, all at the same time receptive to nature in general and rivers in particular. The book is designed to initiate a discourse on the civilizational quest for water commons, indeed, with the expectation that a discussion on rights and rivers would lead to a creative flow of ideas and practices.",

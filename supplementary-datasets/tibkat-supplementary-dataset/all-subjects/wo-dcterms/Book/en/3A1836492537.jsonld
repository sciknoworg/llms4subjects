            "title": "Paul Lorenzen -- Mathematician and Logician",
            "abstract": "This open access book examines the many contributions of Paul Lorenzen, an outstanding philosopher from the latter half of the 20th century. It features papers focused on integrating Lorenzen's original approach into the history of logic and mathematics. The papers also explore how practitioners can implement Lorenzen\u2019s systematical ideas in today\u2019s debates on proof-theoretic semantics, databank management, and stochastics. Coverage details key contributions of Lorenzen to constructive mathematics, Lorenzen\u2019s work on lattice-groups and divisibility theory, and modern set theory and Lorenzen\u2019s critique of actual infinity. The contributors also look at the main problem of Grundlagenforschung and Lorenzen\u2019s consistency proof and Hilbert\u2019s larger program. In addition, the papers offer a constructive examination of a Russell-style Ramified Type Theory and a way out of the circularity puzzle within the operative justification of logic and mathematics. Paul Lorenzen's name is associated with the Erlangen School of Methodical Constructivism, of which the approach in linguistic philosophy and philosophy of science determined philosophical discussions especially in Germany in the 1960s and 1970s. This volume features 10 papers from a meeting that took place at the University of Konstanz",

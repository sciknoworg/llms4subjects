            "title": "Psychiatric Disorders : Trends and Developments",
            "abstract": "Due to their prevalence, pervasiveness and burden inflicted on men and women of today, psychiatric disorders are considered as one of the most important, sever and painful illnesses. This impairment of cognitive, emotional, or behavioural functioning is in some cases tragic. Aside from knowing the physical organic factors, such as infections, endocrinal illnesses or head injuries, the aetiology of psychiatric disorders has remained a mystery. However, recent advances in psychiatry and neuroscience have been successful in discovering subsequent pathophysiology and reaching associated bio-psycho-social factors. This book consists of recent trends and developments in psychiatry from all over the world, presented in the form of multifarious and comprehensive articles. The first two sections of the book are reserved for articles on schizophrenia and depression, two major illnesses present in this field. The third section of the book is reserved for addiction psychiatry, related not only to socio-cultural but also biological alterations. The last section of the book, titled Biological Neuropsychiatry, consists of three topics - updated molecular biology, fundamental neuroscience and clinical neuropsychiatric conditions. Doubtlessly, this book will be fruitful for future developments and collaboration in world psychiatry",

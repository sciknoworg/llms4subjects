            "title": "Terahertz Spectroscopy - A Cutting Edge Technology",
            "abstract": "The terahertz regime of the electromagnetic spectrum was largely unexplored due to the lack of technology needed to generate and detect the radiation. However, in the last couple of decades, there has been a dramatic increase in tools needed to harness the radiation. This remarkable progress made in the development of terahertz sources, components, and detectors has resulted in an ever-increasing inquisitiveness of the applications of terahertz technology in a wide range of fields including medicine, pharmaceuticals, security, sensing, and quality assurance. This book, Terahertz Spectroscopy - A Cutting Edge Technology, presents an overview of the recent advances in terahertz technology and their application in a vast array of fields. The scientists and students are encouraged to read and share the content of this volume. The book also provides a good starting point for researchers who are new to the terahertz regime. The various chapters of the book have been written by renowned scientists in different parts of the world who are at the forefront of terahertz research fields. It is our (InTech publisher, editor, and authors) hope that this book will enhance knowledge and stimulate more interest and future research in terahertz technology",

            "abstract": "This book explores the interrelation of contemporary French theatre and poetry.    Using the pictorial turn in the various branches of art and science, its observable features, and the theoretical framework of the conceptual metaphor, this study seeks to gather together the divergent manners in which French poetry and theatre address this turn. Poetry in space and theatricality of poetry are studied alongside theatre, especially to the performative aspect of the originally theological concept of \"\"kenosis\"\". In doing so the author attempts to make use of the theological concept of kenosis, of central importance in Novarina\u2019s oeuvre, for theatrical and dramatological purposes. Within poetic rituals, kenotic rituals are also examined in the book in a few theatrical practices \u2013 J\u00e1nos Pilinszky and Robert Wilson, Jerzy Grotowski and Eugenio Barba \u2013 facilitating a better understanding of Novarina\u2019s works.   Accompanied by new English translations in the appendices, this is the first English language monograph related to the French essayist, dramaturg and director Val\u00e8re Novarina\u2019s theatre, and will be of great interest to students and scholars in theatre and literature studies",

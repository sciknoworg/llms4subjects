                "\u201cWith this seminal work, Norheim and Haga open a new chapter in their ongoing reflection on rhetoric and leadership. The book is directed at any leader and speaker wishing to reflect on the art of speaking well when things are not going so well. This book will enrich not only academics, leaders, and students, but all who are interested in the dynamics of words to use in a crisis.\u201d \u2014Ian Nell, Stellenbosch University, South Africa \u201cThis book has become even more important on account of the war and suffering that is currently unfolding before our very eyes in the heart of Europe. \u2018If people experience a crisis, the speaker need to name that reality\u2019, the two authors rightly emphasise in this important book. Few have done it better than the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. No-one can stay indifferent when President Zelensky speaks, as he quickly rattles any trace of complacency out of his audience. His unconventional, direct rhetoric is also what this book helps us better understand, while at the same time giving us advice and concrete guidelines on how to craft a powerful and effective address, when a minor or major crisis is emerging.\u201d \u2014Bj\u00f8rn Berge, Deputy Secretary General in the Council of Europe Fear is an inescapable part of how human beings experience reality. The impact of fear becomes particularly evident in a crisis. When a crisis strikes, be it a war, a pandemic, global warming or a financial crisis, leaders are challenged to exercise sound judgement by speaking and acting. This book argues that there are three fears every leader has to know \u2013 apocalyptic fear, political fear, and private fear. By appealing to these three fears in an adequate manner, a leader`s appeal to fear may serve a constructive purpose in a crisis.

                "The book highlights recent developments in the field of biomedical sensors with a focus on technology and design aspects of novel sensors and sensor systems. Diagnosis plays a central role in healthcare and requires a variety of novel biomedical sensors and sensor systems. This creates an enormous ongoing demand for sensors for both the everyday life as well as for medical care. Technologies concerning the analysis of human activities as well as for the early detection of diseases are moving into the focus of interest and form the basis for supporting human health and quality of life. As such, the book offers a key reference guide about novel medical sensors and systems for students, engineers, sensors designers and technicians.",

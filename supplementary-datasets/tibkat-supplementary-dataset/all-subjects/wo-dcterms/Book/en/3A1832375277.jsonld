This discovery has recently stimulated research on other two-dimensional (2D) systems, all consisting of a single layer of atoms. Two-dimensional materials have also emerged as major candidates for use in next-generation applications as a result of the rapid discovery of their any properties. In this Special Issue, we have collected a few recent studies that examine some of these new areas of work in the field of 2D materials.\"",

                "This book is a complete and compact manual on the radiographic testing. It covers every aspect of the test method including radiation safety and its modern techniques. It is specifically designed as a quick guide and reference manual for field engineers. There are chapters on basic physics of radiation, radiographic equipment, radiographic film and screen, radiography application and techniques, among others. The contents also include pedagogical features such as end-of-chapter numerical problems and chapters on \u2018How to write Procedure for Testing\u2019 and \u2018How to write Instructions for Testing\u2019 which are practical tips that are not found in standard textbooks. This book is a useful resource for professionals and researchers in the areas of radiography and radiometry.",

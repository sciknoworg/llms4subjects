                "This book focuses on the development of relevant theories and concepts that aid in predicting and modifying consumer behaviors. Consumer behaviors that help improve well-being, such as earning, spending, borrowing, and saving are also covered. In addition, the book discusses how to define consumer rights and responsibilities, and how individual consumers are organized to protect their own interests and to voice their concerns in public decision making processes. Finally, the book covers effects of economic environments on consumer well-being and how consumers can effectively deal with these challenges."

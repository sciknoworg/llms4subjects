            "abstract": "\"The Neuroscience of the Developing Child informs Early Years (EY) students, practitioners and parents about the fundamental importance of self-regulation (SR) as a critical skill for young children to develop if they are to go on to lead happy and fulfilled lives. Packed with accessible information concerning the neuroscience of early brain development alongside real-life case studies, this book clearly demonstrates how to put SR theory into action across educational and home settings. Dr Conkbayir draws upon a wide range of resources to show readers how they can nurture SR through their daily interactions with children, the environment and experiences they offer them. Comprehensive and engaging chapters cover topics such as: Examining what exactly SR is (and what it is not) Co-regulation's critical role in enabling SR to occur Exploring the developing brain The importance of sensory integration as part of SR Using relational approaches to nurture behaviour in the classroom and at home The wider, global role of SR in creating a sustainable future. With real-life case studies and reflective questions in every chapter, this book is essential reading for students and practitioners within the EY sector, as well as anyone beyond the sector wanting to develop their understanding of SR and how to apply it for themselves and others\"--",

            "title": "Chlorosulfonic acid : A versatile reagent",
            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Since its discovery in 1854, chlorosulfonic acid has demonstrated that it is a truly versatile reagent. It is widely used as a sulfonating and chlorosulfonating agent, particularly of organic compounds, and it provides useful synthetic intermediates for many branches of industry. This book provides a detailed, up to date account of the reactions of chlorosulfonic acid with aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic compounds; reactions with elements and inorganic compounds are also discussed, along with the use of the reagent as a powerful acid catalyst, and halogenation and dehydrating agent. Finally, the commercial uses and manufacture of chlorosulfonic acid are reviewed. The detailed coverage in this book, coupled with the many references to recent work, will ensure that it is welcomed as a reference by synthetic chemists in, for example, the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, plastic and detergent industries. Researchers and their students in academia will also find it a valuable addition to their bookshelves",

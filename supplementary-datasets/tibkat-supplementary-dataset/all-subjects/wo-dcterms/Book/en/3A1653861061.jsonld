                "This authoritative book provides readers with a comprehensive view of advanced nuclear analytical techniques for metallomics and metalloproteomics, Nuclear analytical techniques have many advantages over other techniques, such as high sensitivity and precision. They couple powerful selective separation with sensitive element-specific detection. The uses of metalloproteomics studies are restricted to the fields of analytical and nuclear chemistry. They also have great potential to elucidate the origins of certain diseases and assist in their diagnosis and treatment via the development of new drugs. Nuclear Analytical Techniques for Metallomics and Metalloproteomics provides readers with a comprehensive view of this relatively new and exciting area of bioanalytical and inorganic chemistry. It contains contributions from experts in disciplines as diverse as analytical chemistry, nuclear chemistry, environmental science, molecular biology and medicinal chemistry. Various nuclear analytical techniques are covered including neutron activation analysis, X-ray fluorescence, isotope tracer, Mossbauer spectrometry, X-ray absorption spectrometry, and neutron scattering and diffraction. They provide useful information both for chemical speciation analysis and structural characterization of metalloproteins and metals in biological systems. Consequently, the book is not only relevant for chemists involved in nuclear techniques and speciation, but also environmental, nutritional and clinical researchers and drug developers. The book includes many illustrations, tables and documents to support the coverage of the latest developments. It also offers a well-organized bibliography to facilitate further reading"

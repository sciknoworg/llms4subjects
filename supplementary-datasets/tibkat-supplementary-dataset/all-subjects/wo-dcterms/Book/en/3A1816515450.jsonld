                "This book is intended for a wide range of researchers both from academia and industry interested in contributing to industries in an interdisciplinary way. The primary industries, including agriculture, fishery, and power industries, are the most fundamental infrastructure of the human societies. Traditionally, primary industries have been managed in the small family/community base, but with increase in population and development of society, the size of primary industry has grown. The efficiency, quality, and stability of these industries affect the societies significantly, so that they have become one of the major areas that mathematics could contribute to substantially. Also, primary industries are affected by the environment, where mathematical studies play an essential role. The conference was hosted by the research community in New Zealand, where such collaborative activities in mathematics between the industry and academia have been successfully established from an early stage. This enabled the conference to bring together a range of research topics- from pioneering works to cutting-edge results, from agriculture to geothermal energy and nuclear fusion, and from mathematical modeling and analysis to data analysis.",

            "abstract": "Ninth in a series of annual reports comparing business regulations in 183 economies, Doing Business 2012 measures regulations affecting 11 areas of everyday business activity: \u2022 starting a business \u2022 dealing with construction permits \u2022 employing workers \u2022 registering property \u2022 getting credit \u2022 protecting investors \u2022 paying taxes \u2022 trading across borders \u2022 enforcing contracts \u2022 closing a business \u2022 getting electricity The report updates all indicators as of June 1, 2011, ranks countries on their overall \"\"ease of doing business\"\", and analyzes reforms to business regulation\u2014identifying which countries are strengthening their business environment the most.

Such regulations should be efficient, striking a balance between safeguarding some important aspects of the business environment and avoiding distortions that impose unreasonable costs on businesses. Where business regulation is burdensome and competition limited, success depends more on whom you know than on what you can do. But where regulations are relatively easy to comply with and accessible to all who need to use them, anyone with talent and a good idea should be able to start and grow a business in the formal sector. \u201cThe Doing Business report, which was started in 2003, has become one of the key ways in which the bank and other observers gauge business climate within developing countries...\u201d -- The Financial Times \u201c[Doing Business started] as a way to encourage countries to reduce obstacles to entrepreneurship.

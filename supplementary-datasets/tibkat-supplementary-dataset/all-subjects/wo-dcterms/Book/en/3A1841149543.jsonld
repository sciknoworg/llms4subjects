            "abstract": "Drawing on the thoughts of Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, this open access book seeks to understand the politics of childhood art by attending to the relational matters in children\u2019s artistic practices rather than the linear age-based developmental theories which often limit children\u2019s creativity. Weaving Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s ideas on pedagogy, politics, and aesthetics, with a research study at a Kindergarten classroom in the USA and the author\u2019s own art experiences in South Korea as a child, Hayon Park discusses the politics and ethics of teacher-led art projects, children\u2019s popular culture, and adult-child drawing companionship. The author argues that childhood art and in education is inherently political and relational as, from an early age, children are acutely aware of monitoring, categorisation, and the potential oppression of their art making and learning. Offering a post-structural, reconceptualist approach to art education, Park argues for new emancipatory practices and pedagogies, which encourage children's creativity and activate curiosity.

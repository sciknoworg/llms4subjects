Two decades have passed since the devolution of social care policy, with key differences emerging between the UK\u2019s four systems, but what impact have these differences had? This book presents for the first time research on the perspectives of social care policy makers on the four systems in which they operate and the ways in which they borrow from one another.   Drawing on extensive interviews with national and local policy makers across the UK, the book raises vital questions about the role of \u2018standardisation\u2019 and \u2018differentiation\u2019 in social care, concluding that when given equal capacity to reform their respective systems, the regimes in each nation may take radically different shapes",

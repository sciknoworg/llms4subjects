Using his precognitive dreams as an alternate model of time measurement and its relationship to dreams, Dunne proposed a concept of multidimensional time leading to higher levels of consciousness, and, eventually, immortality.

                "\"The theory of time has always been a source of philosophical conjecture and discussion. J. W. Dunne's An Experiment with Time sparked a great debate in the scientific community-as well as a fair amount of controversy when first published in 1927. Dunne (1866-1949), an aeronautical engineer and designer of military aircraft, experienced a series of strange and vivid dreams that came true with shocking regularity. Re-evaluating the concept of time as multidimensional, he proposed the precognition of dreams as a prediction of future experiences by the dreamer, which would lead to higher levels of consciousness, and, eventually, immortality. This life-altering insight accounted for many of life's mysteries: the purpose of dreams and prophecy, the phenomenon of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the concept of higher consciousness, and the belief in eternal life. Dunne gives readers first-hand experiences and insights into the mystery of time and the dream state, and its evolution into the realm of cosmic consciousness\"--"

            "abstract": "\"Mobile network evolves with new system generations bringing higher speeds and new service capabilities, with improved system architectures and novel radio technologies. With this evolution 5G mobile backhaul and fronthaul play an increasing role with new challenges in matching the new 5G system capabilities. With 5G higher peak rates are for sure an important enhancement like it was with 4G. This is just a single item however. 5G is the most versatile mobile system so far which supports not only traditional mobile broadband but also new industrial and enterprise use cases with building blocks like network slicing for unique services. URLLC service extends 5G capability to applications which were previously not possible in a mobile system. 5G network is built to serve different use cases and customers and these impact also transport. New high frequency bands mean not only high capacity, but also a potentially huge amount of small cells. As well, radio signals from outdoor sites are heavily attenuated indoors. So indoor solutions will be required for coverage with related connectivity solutions.\"--",

            "abstract": "Yeats\u2019s Mask, Yeats Annual No. 19 is a special issue in this renowned research-level series. Fashionable in the age of Wilde, the Mask changes shape until it emerges as Mask in the system of A Vision. Chronologically tracing the concept through Yeats\u2019s plays and those poems written as \u2018texts for exposition\u2019 of his occult thought which flowers in A Vision itself (1925 and 1937), the volume also spotlights \u2018The Mask before The Mask\u2019 numerous plays including Cathleen Ni-Houlihan, The King\u2019s Threshold, Calvary,The Words upon the Window-pane, A Full Moon in March and The Death of Cuchulain. There are excurses into studies of Yeats\u2019s friendship with the Oxford don and cleric, William Force Stead, his radio broadcasts, the Chinese contexts for his writing of \u2018Lapis Lazuli\u2019. His self-renewal after The Oxford Book of Modern Verse, and the key occult epistolary exchange \u2018Leo Africanus\u2019, edited from MSS by Steve L. Adams and George Mills Harper, is republished from the elusive Yeats Annual No. 1 (1982). The essays are by David Bradshaw, Michael Cade-Stewart, Aisling Carlin, Warwick Gould, Margaret Mills Harper, Pierre Longuenesse, Jerusha McCormack, Neil Mann, Emilie Morin, Elizabeth M\u00fcller and Alexandra Poulain, with shorter notes by Philip Bishop and Colin Smythe considering Yeats\u2019s quatrain upon remaking himself and the pirate editions of The Land of Heart\u2019s Desire. Ten reviews focus on various volumes of the Cornell Yeats MSS Series, his correspondence with George Yeats, and numerous critical studies",

            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Nutritional Aspects of Bone Health provides an in-depth review of the role of diet in the development and maintenance of bone health throughout the lifecycle, and prevention of osteoporosis in later life. The book is multi-authored by the world's leading researchers in this area, who have come together to formulate the first ever textbook on nutritional aspects of bone health, and includes the current and cutting edge science underpinning the prevention of bone disease. The book is structured such that, in the first section, an overview is provided on what is meant by the terms bone health and osteoporosis and includes key areas such as epidemiology, genetics and the impact of non-nutritional exogenous factors influencing the skeleton. The second section details the established nutritional factors affecting bone health, namely calcium and vitamin D. Section three focuses on the role of macronutrients and macrominerals in bone health, namely protein, phosphorus, sodium and potassium, including the criticality of acid-base homeostasis to skeletal integrity. Section four addresses the effects of microminerals, trace elements, vitamin K, vitamin A and isoflavones on bone.  Section five focuses attention on key issues connected with the influence of diet and anorexia and bulimia on bone health including nutrition and bone growth; nutrient:gene interactions; nutrient:drug interactions; and the final section discusses the effect of diet on reduction of fracture risk; the cost-effectiveness of nutritional supplements; and nutritional strategies for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The book is targeted at a number of key audiences. Whilst there is a focus on the academic research world and those principally involved in education, at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, the book will also be of considerable interest to those participating in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, namely those working in the medical and health promotion fields. Furthermore, Nutritional Aspects of Bone Health will be of particular interest to the food industry as the popularity of foods designed to target specific health issues increases, and nutritional therapy has a critical role to play in this major public health problem",

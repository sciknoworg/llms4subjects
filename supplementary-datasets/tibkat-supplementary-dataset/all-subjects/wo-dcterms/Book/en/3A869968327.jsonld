            "abstract": "The phrase \u2018New Normal\u2019 captures the ongoing shift in the pattern and drivers of China\u2019s economic growth. China\u2019s new growth rate is both slower and imposing difficult structural change. These new economic conditions are challenging yet offer opportunities for China and its economic partners. Reforms must be deepened but also make growth more inclusive and environmentally sustainable, over this decade and beyond.  This year\u2019s Update offers both global context and domestic insight into this challenging new phase of China\u2019s domestic economic transformation. How are policymakers elevating migrant workers concurrent with increasing consumption? Is China\u2019s government spending enough on education and R&D to ensure it can achieve its aspirations to ascend the global manufacturing value chain and avoid the middle-income trap? Are energy market reforms reducing or increasing the price of gas and electricity in China? What are the consequences of China\u2019s financial reforms and expanding Renminbi trading for foreign banks? What does China\u2019s new growth model mean for the international resources economy and for Africa? Do SOEs face market conditions and are they dominating China\u2019s fast-rising outbound investment? What is China\u2019s strategy for navigating fragmented international trade policy negotiations?",

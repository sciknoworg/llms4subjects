            "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies represent a diverse spectrum of cancers with notable global incidence and prevalence. The comprehensive care of individuals affected by these malignancies is a multifaceted endeavor involving the collaboration of various medical disciplines. The nonspecific clinical manifestations of GI cancers often present a formidable diagnostic challenge to primary care providers, resulting in diagnostic delays. Subsequently, the treatment regimens, once initiated, are often demanding and prolonged, and profoundly impact the patients' overall quality of life. Given the intricate involvement of the digestive system, nutritional concerns are pervasive among these patients, influencing both their quality of life and survival. Despite these considerable challenges, the evolving landscape of treatment modalities has yielded improved outcomes, enabling a greater number of patients to achieve remission or extended survival. It is now imperative that we delve deeper into understanding the unique needs of this patient population and refine the care delivery pathways through enhanced diagnostic approaches, treatment strategies, and holistic support, and ultimately enhance the overall value of care provided to individuals afflicted by GI malignancies",

            "abstract": "Solving nonlinear equations in Banach spaces (real or complex nonlinear equations, nonlinear systems, and nonlinear matrix equations, among others), is a non-trivial task that involves many areas of science and technology. Usually the solution is not directly affordable and require an approach using iterative algorithms. This Special Issue focuses mainly on the design, analysis of convergence, and stability of new schemes for solving nonlinear problems and their application to practical problems. Included papers study the following topics: Methods for finding simple or multiple roots either with or without derivatives, iterative methods for approximating different generalized inverses, real or complex dynamics associated to the rational functions resulting from the application of an iterative method on a polynomial. Additionally, the analysis of the convergence has been carried out by means of different sufficient conditions assuring the local, semilocal, or global convergence. This Special issue has allowed us to present the latest research results in the area of iterative processes for solving nonlinear equations as well as systems and matrix equations. In addition to the theoretical papers, several manuscripts on signal processing, nonlinear integral equations, or partial differential equations, reveal the connection between iterative methods and other branches of science and engineering",

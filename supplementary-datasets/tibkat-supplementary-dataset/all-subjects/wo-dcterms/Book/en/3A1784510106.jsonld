            "abstract": "\"This book offers up novel research which uses analytical approaches to explore nonlinear features exhibited by various dynamic processes. Relevant to disciplines across engineering and physics, the asymptotic method combined with the multiple scale method is shown to be an efficient and intuitive way to approach mechanics. Beginning with new material on the development of cutting-edge asymptotic methods and multiple scale methods, the book introduces this method in time domain and provides examples of vibrations of systems. Clearly written throughout, it uses innovative graphics to exemplify complex concepts such as nonlinear stationary and nonstationary processes, various resonances and jump pull-in phenomena. It also demonstrates the simplification of problems through using mathematical modelling, by employing the use of limiting phase trajectories to quantify nonlinear phenomena. Particularly relevant to structural mechanics, in rods, cables, beams, plates and shells, as well as mechanical objects commonly found in everyday devices such as mobile phones and cameras, the book shows how each system is modelled, and how it behaves under various conditions. It will be of interest to engineers and professionals in mechanical engineering and structural engineering, alongside those interested in vibrations and dynamics. It will also be useful to those studying engineering maths and physics\"--",

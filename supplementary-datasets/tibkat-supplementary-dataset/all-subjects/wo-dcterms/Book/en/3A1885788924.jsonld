            "abstract": "In Genes for Africa, Jennifer Thomson separates fact from fiction and explains why and how GM crops can help us combat poverty, starvation and disease in the developing world, in a safe and responsible way. In the first part of the book the author explains the technology and looks at the differences and similarities between genetic modification, conventional plant breeding, and natural processes such as cross pollination and mutations. Subsequent chapters are devoted to controversial issues such as food safety (for GM crops and organically grown food), patents, labelling, regulations and controls, and there is a question-and-answer section where the author addresses oft-repeated concerns and fears. The book ends with a focus on Africa and possible future developments in GM technology. Glossaries, interest boxes, appendices with additional technical information, and a comprehensive list of web sites add value to this accessible and informative volume",

            "abstract": "\"Depending on the mechanisms involved in non-thermal technologies (such as ozonisation, irradiation, ultrasound processing, plasma processing, and advanced oxidative processes) interaction with food molecules differs, which might lead to desirable, reactions. Non-Thermal Technologies for the Food Industry: Advances and Regulations explores the possibility of using non-thermal technologies for various purposes such as shelf-life extension, reduced energy consumption, adhesion, and safety improvement. Further, it reviews the present status of these technologies, international regulations, and sustainability aspects in food processing including global case studies. The book provides comprehensive overview of all the non-thermal processing technologies that have potential for use within food manufacturing and covers novel disinfectant technologies and packaging methods for non-thermal processing. It further includes electro spraying and electrospinning; low temperature drying techniques, cold plasma techniques, hydrodynamic cavitation, oscillating magnetic field processing and so forth while also focusing on topics such as the valorization of agri-food wastes and by-products, and sustainability. The book also reviews ClO2 in combined/hybrid technologies for food processing. This book is aimed at researchers and graduate students in food and food process engineering\"--",

            "abstract": "\"Porous media exist in different modern materials. It presents great surface areas with small pore size distribution. These types of materials with controllable and adjustable pore diameters are given considerable attention due to their suitable properties and applications in several fields. Porous materials have many applications in our daily life. We use different types of porous materials to clean our drinking water, for instance. This new research-oriented volume focuses on exploring the wide range of porous materials. In this new volume, original contributions from international authors along with case studies on the synthesis, design, characterization, and applications of different types of porous materials and solids are presented in detail. The book covers different types of porous materials in the broad sense by considering experimental and theoretical aspects of materials science related to porous materials and solids. The book aims to help approach characterizing a particular types of materials for more in-depth analysis. This book is divided into three parts to determine the best techniques for solving particular porous materials problems, and in each part, the fabrication and characterization of porous materials are explored with applications, describing new methodologies to gain the required information along with limitations of various methods. To make this new title a practical reference book for research students and for engineers and scientists of different disciplines working with porous materials and solids, the editors have selected a very comprehensive range of case studies as well, designed to cover the basic concepts of porosity. These case studies also describe different types of pores and surfaces for readers\"--",

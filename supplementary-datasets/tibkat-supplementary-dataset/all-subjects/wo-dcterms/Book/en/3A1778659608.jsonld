            "abstract": "Diesel engines, also known as CI engines, possess a wide field of applications as energy converters because of their higher efficiency. However, diesel engines are a major source of NOX and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Because of its importance, five chapters in this book have been devoted to the formulation and control of these pollutants. The world is currently experiencing an oil crisis. Gaseous fuels like natural gas, pure hydrogen gas, biomass-based and coke-based syngas can be considered as alternative fuels for diesel engines. Their combustion and exhaust emissions characteristics are described in this book. Reliable early detection of malfunction and failure of any parts in diesel engines can save the engine from failing completely and save high repair cost. Tools are discussed in this book to detect common failure modes of diesel engine that can detect early signs of failure",

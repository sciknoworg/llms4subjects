            "abstract": "\"This book focuses on the ten essentials of facilities planning and design. It covers topics such as strategic planning, space standards, architectural programming, site selection, master planning, environmental planning, capital improvement planning, workplace planning and design, and space management. Examples will be drawn from the planning and design of airports and universities which are large organisations with extensive campuses and are asset heavy in terms of buildings. This second edition has been extensively updated with current and new examples, case studies and references. By learning about the planning and design processes as it relates to facilities, students and facility professionals will be able to align facilities planning and design with the organisation's strategic priorities, manage design consultants by understanding the planning and design process, manage the planning and design of spaces at different scales, and manage the use of existing space effectively. The book is designed such that its chapters may be read either sequentially or as individual standalone references or resources for specific aspects of facility planning, management and design\"--",

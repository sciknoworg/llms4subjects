            "abstract": "\"Wave Dispersion Characteristics of Continuous Mechanical Systems provides a mechanical engineering-based analysis of wave dispersion response in various structures created from different materials. Looking at materials including strengthened nanocomposites, functionally graded materials, metal foams and anisotropic materials, it uses analytical solution methods to solve typical problems in the framework of a micromechanics approach. Nanocomposites are a novel type of composite materials, fabricated through dispersing nanosized reinforcements in a matrix to combine the material properties of the matrix with the improved properties of nanosize elements. This book enables readers to learn about the theory and practical applications of this rapidly evolving field. Practically minded, the book investigates the impact of employing various nanofillers, and demonstrating how this augments stiffness within the nanocomposite. Topics covered include agglomeration and waviness of nanofillers, porosity, elastic mediums, fluid flow, and the impact of the thermal environment on a propagated wave. Using mathematical formulations to solve wave dispersion characteristics of structures including beams, plates and shells, the book obtains equations of structures using first and higher-order shear deformation theories. This book will be of interest to professional engineers working in material and mechanical engineering, nanocomposites, nanofillers and micromechanics. It will also be of interest to students of these fields\"--",

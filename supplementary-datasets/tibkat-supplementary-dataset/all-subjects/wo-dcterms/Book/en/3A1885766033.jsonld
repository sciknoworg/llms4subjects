            "abstract": "Wide-ranging contact networks ensure the dissemination and transfer of knowledge, goods and cultural values. The transportation of goods and people can be seen as one of the most important cornerstones of such exchange systems. Therefore, the search for transportation options and the development of suitable vehicles have probably always been firmly anchored in human thought. The articles presented here are based on the papers presented at the conference \"Transports, Transport Routes and Transport Structures\" organized by the Bronze Age Working Group and the Collaborative Research Centre 1070 Resource Cultures. They not only summarize existing evidence on transport routes and vehicles as well as statements on infrastructure in the archaeological findings of the Bronze Age, but also supplement them with numerous aspects worth knowing. What can these findings tell us about the transportation vehicles and their significance? What characteristics did they have? Are the finds worn-out or deliberately destroyed vehicles or parts of such vehicles? What technological and social implications can be linked to the findings? How should we imagine the Bronze Age infrastructure in different regions? To what extent did transportation routes and exchange form a resource? This volume is dedicated to answering these questions in detail, resulting in a comprehensive overview of finds, findings and theories. Translated with DeepL.com (free version)",

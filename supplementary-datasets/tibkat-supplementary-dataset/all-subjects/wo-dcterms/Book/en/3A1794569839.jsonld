            "abstract": "This book is a collection of 12 peer-reviewed articles on freshwater invasive fish and is the first on this topic. It focuses on real-world lessons learned from managing common carp, bigheaded carp, sea lamprey, northern pike, and lake trout in different parts of the world. Articles also discuss damage caused by invasive fish, environmental DNA as means to measure spawning carp, and CO2 as a fish deterrent. Detailed critical evaluations of the possibility of using koi herpes virus to control common carp, market-driven fishing (invasivorism), as well as changes in lock and dam operating protocols to control bigheaded carps are also presented. Several important commonalities are noted between successful management efforts, including the simultaneous use of multiple integrated strategies, a focus on suppressing reproduction, and a deep local knowledge in an introductory article that provides context for the discipline",

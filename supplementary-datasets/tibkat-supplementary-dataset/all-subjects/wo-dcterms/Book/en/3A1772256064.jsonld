            "abstract": "In this meticulously documented study, Krizs\u00e1n and Roggeband demonstrate how the Istanbul Convention mobilized conservative forces, fostered intricate ties between autocratic states and nonstate actors, refigured civil society to advantage anti-equality activists, defunded feminist organizations providing services to abused women and shifted resources to conservative organizations favoring \u201cfamily values\u201d over women\u2019s empowerment. Their insightful analysis has vital lessons for those concerned with social justice in the 21st century. --Mary Hawkesworth, Rutgers University This incisive analysis of the politics of violence against women in Central and Eastern Europe highlights how some determined governments are blocking or reversing important gains on the international legal front through concerted political and civic action. A cautionary story with important implications for the broader fight to advance women's rights globally. --Thomas Carothers, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace This important study compares and challenges Central and Eastern European pushback movements against the Istanbul Convention. The Convention for the first time provides legally binding definitions of \u201cgender\u201d and \u201cgender-based violence against women\u201d, misinterpreted by conservative forces opposing this progressive international instrument. This book shows how positive instruments like the Istanbul Convention can be judged as problematic and that much more is needed to make gender equality a reality. --Dubravka \u0160imonovi\u0107, Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its Causes and Consequences This book examines opposition to the Council of Europe\u2019s Istanbul Convention and its consequences for the politics of violence against women in four countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Krizs\u00e1n and Roggeband discuss why and how successful anti-gender mobilizations managed to obstruct ratification of the Convention or push for withdrawal from it. They show how resistance to the Convention significantly redraws debates on violence against women and has consequences for policies, women\u2019s rights advocacy and gender-equal democracy. Andrea Krizs\u00e1n is a professor at the Central European University, Austria. Conny Roggeband is an associate professor of political science at the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands.",

            "abstract": "\"Dedicated to the proper design, layout, and location of facilities, this definitive textbook outlines the main design and operational problems that occur in manufacturing and service systems, explains the significance of facility design and planning problems, and describes how mathematical models can be used to help analyze and solve them. Combining theory with practice, this revised textbook presents state-of-the-art topics in materials handling, warehousing, and logistics along with real-world examples that emphasize the importance of modeling and analysis when determining a solution to complex facility design problems. Facilities Design, Fifth Edition includes a balanced coverage of modeling as well as applications of layout, materials handling, and warehousing. It presents automated materials handling along with queuing, queuing networks, and basic simulation modeling. The new edition introduces new material that includes topics such as supply chain designing and management, aggregate planning, deterministic inventory control, stochastic inventory control and transportation, logistic, and distribution. The new edition will continue to provide access to Layout-iQ software and data files from the author's own website for many of the numerical examples contained in the book. A solutions manual, PowerPoint slides, and figure, slides are available for qualified textbooks adoptions. The book addresses facilities design and layout problems in manufacturing systems and covers layout, logistics, supply chain, warehousing, and materials handling. The new edition continues to explain the ins and outs of facility planning and design and is an ideal textbook for students and a reference for professionals\"--",

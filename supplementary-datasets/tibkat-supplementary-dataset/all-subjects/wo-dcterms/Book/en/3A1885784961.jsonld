            "abstract": "The growing number of children and adolescents with a migrant background in Italy has radically changed the composition of the country\u2019s primary and secondary school populations. However, only recently have some of these students have begun entering university. This lag can be explained by the fact that a history of migration brings with it multiple economic, social and educational disadvantages and weaknesses. The book More than is required. Tales of university students with a migrant background is a collection of biographies of young people who, having exceeded society\u2019s common expectations \u2014and therefore having done \u201cmore than is required\"\u2014have achieved exceptional scholastic results, leading them to wish to continue their studies at university. Their stories of family and school, relationships with peers, and their ambitions, successes and struggles reveal the critical challenges they face, and offer some ways current educational policies can be improved",

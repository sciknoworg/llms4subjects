                "This path-breaking collection, edited by two leading scholars in the field, brings together seminal contributions from the burgeoning multidisciplinary literature on the globalization of retailing. In addition to focusing on the retail corporations and their expansionary strategies, it explores the multi-faceted impacts of retail globalization on host economies and profiles the store and sourcing dimensions of transnational retail activity. These volumes are of particular interest to scholars in management and business studies, economic geography, development studies and economics, and more generally to all social scientists interested in the transformative role of retailing within the global economy",

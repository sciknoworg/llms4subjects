                "\"The proposed book will offer comprehensive and versatile methodologies and recommendations on how to determine dynamic characteristics of typical micro- and opto-electronic structural elements (printed circuit boards, solder joints, heavy devices, etc.) and how to design a viable and reliable structure that would be able to withstand high-level dynamic loading. Particular attention will be given to portable devices and systems designed for operation in harsh environments (such as automotive, aerospace, military, etc.)  In-depth discussion from a mechanical engineer's viewpoint will be conducted to the key components' level as well as the whole device level. Both theoretical (analytical and computer-aided) and experimental methods of analysis will be addressed. The authors will identify how the failure control parameters (e.g. displacement, strain and stress) of the vulnerable components may be affected by the external vibration or shock loading, as well as by the internal parameters of the infrastructure of the device. Guidelines for material selection, effective protection and test methods will be developed for engineering practice\"--",

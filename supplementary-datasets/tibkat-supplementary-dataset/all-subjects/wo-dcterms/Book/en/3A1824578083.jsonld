            "abstract": "\"The proposed book mainly sorts out emerging and burning issues faced day to day by municipal and industrial wastewater treatments. It also provides a comprehensive view of recent advents of hybrid treatment technologies in wastewater treatment, addresses the current limitations and challenges of applying these tools in wastewater treatment systems. This book gives an insight about recent developments in membrane technology for wastewater treatment. Industrial wastewater contains a large variety of compounds, such as heavy metals, salts and nutrients, which makes its treatment challenging. Thus, the use of conventional water treatment methods is not always effective. In this sense, membrane-based hybrid processes have emerged as a promising technology to treat complex industrial wastewater. The present book analyses and discusses the potential of membrane-based hybrid processes for the treatment of complex industrial wastewater along with the recovery of valuable compounds and water reutilization. In addition, recent and future trends in membrane technology are highlighted. Features: Discusses the properties, mechanisms, advantages, limitations and promising solutions of different types of membrane technologies Addresses the optimization of process parameters Describes the performance of different membranes Presents the potential of Nanotechnology to improve the treatment efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) Covers the application of membrane and membrane-based hybrid treatment technologies for wastewater treatment\"--",

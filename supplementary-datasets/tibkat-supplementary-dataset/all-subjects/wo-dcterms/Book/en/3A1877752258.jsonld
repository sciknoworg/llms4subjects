            "abstract": "Breast Cancer - From Biology to Medicine thoroughly examines breast cancer from basic definitions, to cellular and molecular biology, to diagnosis and treatment. This book also has some additional focus on preclinical and clinical results in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The book begins with introduction on epidemiology and pathophysiology of breast cancer in Section 1. In Section 2, the subsequent chapters introduce molecular and cellular biology of breast cancer with some particular signaling pathways, the gene expression, as well as the gene methylation and genomic imprinting, especially the existence of breast cancer stem cells. In Section 3, some new diagnostic methods and updated therapies from surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and some complementary therapies are discussed. This book provides a succinct yet comprehensive overview of breast cancer for advanced students, graduate students, and researchers as well as those working with breast cancer in a clinical setting",

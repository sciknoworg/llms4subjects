            "abstract": "Philosophy begins and ends in disagreement. Philosophers disagree among themselves in innumerable ways, and this pervasive and permanent dissent is a sign of their inability to solve philosophical problems and present well-established substantive truths. This raises the question: \u201cWhat should we do with our philosophical beliefs in light of philosophy\u2019s epistemic failure?\u201d In this open access book, J\u00e1nos Tozs\u00e9r analyzes the possible answers to this question, develops them into comprehensive metaphilosophical visions, and argues that we cannot commit ourselves to any of them in peace, with a clear intellectual conscience, and without self-deception. Tozs\u00e9r calls this disheartening insight \u201cthe experience of breakdown,\u201d claiming that no matter how we struggle, we are unable to create substantive philosophical knowledge that goes beyond the cost-benefit analysis of philosophical theories. He makes the case that, at the same time, we cannot suspend all of our beliefs about the most fundamental facts of our world once and for all, and so forever give up on seeking substantive philosophical truths.

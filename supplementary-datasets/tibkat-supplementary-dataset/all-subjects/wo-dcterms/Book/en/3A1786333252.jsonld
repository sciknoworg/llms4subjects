                "\"This carefully researched book offers fascinating insights into three puzzles: why Japanese governments expanded their contributions to UN peacekeeping since the early 1990s; why Tokyo withdrew its military engineers from South Sudan in 2017; and what this means for future (limited) Japanese engagement in UN and other peace operations.\" \u2014 Stephen Baranyi, University of Ottawa, Canada \u201cThis book is the most comprehensive review to date of Japan\u2019s post-Cold War peacekeeping history. It should be essential reading for everyone who wants to understand Japan\u2019s contribution to UN peacekeeping.\u201d \u2014 Cedric de Coning, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, Norway \u201cThis book is a timely examination of the trajectory of Japanese contributions in this area of global security. The volume analyses Japan\u2019s changing international strategic and domestic motivations to engage in peacekeeping. It takes a fresh and critical approach and fills an important gap in the extant literature.\u201d \u2014 Christopher W. Hughes, University of Warwick, UK This open access book examines why Japan discontinued its quarter-century history of troop contribution to UN Peacekeeping Operations (1992\u20132017). Japan had deployed its troops as UN peacekeepers since 1992, albeit under a constitutional limit on weapons use. Japan\u2019s peacekeepers began to focus on engineering work as its strength, while also trying to relax the constraints on weapons use, although to a minimal extent. In 2017, however, Japan suddenly withdrew its engineering corps from South Sudan, and has contributed no troops since then. Why? The book argues that Japan could not match the increasing \u201crobustness\u201d of recent peacekeeping operations and has begun to seek a new direction, such as capacity-building support.

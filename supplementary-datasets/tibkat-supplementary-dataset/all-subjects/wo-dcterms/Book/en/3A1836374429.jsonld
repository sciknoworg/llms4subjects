A principal ingredient of the par-Merge approach to parataxis is the functional head Par, which triggers par-Merge. While Par is often morphologically realized as a coordinator in English, in certain parentheticals itis never realized. Its absence lends credence to par-Merge\u2019s alternatives, which demand that parataxis be modelled semantically rather than syntactically. In this paper, we provide indirect support for the par-Merge approach by demonstrating that, in the Turkish counterparts to those English parentheticals that never realize Par, Par is realized as the lexeme ki. If ki is indeed Par\u2019s realization in Turkish, one may stipulate that Par\u2019s morphological absence in certain English constructions does not indicate that par-Merge must be discarded or even that its universalityformodellingparataxismustbediminished\u2013itsabsenceindicatesonlythatsomelanguage-specific constraint prevents Par\u2019s realization in certain English parentheticals",

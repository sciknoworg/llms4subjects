                "\"Online Learning Analytics is conceived on trying to answer the questions of those who may be skeptical about online learning. Through better understanding and applying learning analytics, we can assess how successful learning and student/faculty engagement, as examples, can contribute towards producing the educational outcomes needed to advance student learning for future generations. Learning analytics has proven to be successful in many areas, such as the impact of using learning analytics in asynchronous online discussions in higher education. To prepare for a future where online learning plays a major role, this book examines such as: 1) Data insights for improving curriculum design, teaching practice, and learning 2) Scaling up learning analytics in an evidence-informed way 3) The role of trust in online learning. Online learning faces very real philosophical and operational challenges. This book addresses areas of concern about the future of education and learning. It also energizes the field of learning analytics by presenting research on a range of topics that is broad and recognizes the humanness and depth of educating and learning\"--"

            "abstract": "Currently, aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent valvular disease in developed countries. Pathological and molecular mechanisms of AS have been investigated in many aspects. And new therapeutic devices such as transcatheter aortic valve implantation have been developed as a less invasive treatment for high-risk patients. Due to advanced prevalent age of AS, further discovery and technology are required to treat elderly patients for longer life expectancy. This book is an effort to present an up-to-date account of existing knowledge, involving recent development in this field. Various opinion leaders described details of established knowledge or newly recognized advances associated with diagnosis, treatment and mechanism. Thus, this book will enable close intercommunication to another field and collaboration technology for new devices. We hope that it will be an important source, not only for clinicians, but also for general practitioners, contributing to development of better therapeutic adjuncts in the future",

            "abstract": "This book takes the reader from basic questions like \u201cWhat is health?\u201d and \u201cWhat is a psychiatric disorder?\u201d, into the midst of people\u2019s present mental health and enhancement choices. More and more people receive psychiatric diagnoses and the use of psychopharmacological drugs keeps increasing. Concurrently, media report the popularity of \u201cbrain doping\u201d or \u201cstudy drugs\u201d on campuses as well as at the workplace. This open access book tests the hypothesis of whether mental health and enhancement can be seen as two sides of the same coin: that the demands on cognitive and emotional functioning have been increasing and psychoactive substances are used to meet these demands. Whether the increasing number of diagnoses means that really more people are suffering from psychological problems will be discussed just as whether the media accurately describe \u201cbrain doping\u201d as a new and rising trend. An individual section describes non-pharmacological alternatives to maintain and increase one\u2019s mental well-being. To answer these and many more questions, the author critically reviews evidence from epidemiology, psychiatry, and psychology. That people with and without psychiatric diagnoses are often using the same substances \u2013 for example, the stimulant drugs Adderall or Ritalin \u2013 to cope with their problems is presented as evidence to look beyond the traditional distinction between disorder, health, and enhancement. Likewise, different meanings of \u201cdrug\u201d in historical and present contexts illustrate that the way we think of mental health and (il)legitimate drug use reflects our own culture. The book\u2019s focus on addiction/substance use disorders makes it also relevant to the ongoing discussion of drug policy",

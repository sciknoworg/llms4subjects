Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing: Fundamental Sciences and Advances introduces the timeline and history of wire arc additive manufacturing. It offers a critical review of WAAM, its variants, processing steps, and the mechanical and microstructural aspects of developed components. The book showcases the methods and practices that need to be followed to synchronize WAAM with other conventional metal additive manufacturing as well as other conventional techniques. The process steps, equipment, and the different materials used are discussed in detail along with the various process parameters and their optimization to counter the challenges and defects. Applications, trends, and case studies are also included in the book. Aimed at providing a concrete reference for researchers, academics, and professionals, this book allows for a thorough understanding of the different concepts and intricacies of WAAM\"--",

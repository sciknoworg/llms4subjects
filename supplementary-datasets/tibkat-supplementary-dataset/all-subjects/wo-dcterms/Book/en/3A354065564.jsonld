            "abstract": "There has been increasing pressure for NGOs working in development to expand the scale of their activities, especially in response to HIV in developing countries. Through the experience of NGOs working in different contexts, this book analyses when expansion is appropriate, how to make it effective, how one might measure the costs, and what the implications for organizations may be. The author draws on case studies presented at an international seminar of NGOs and others specifically to address the issues of growth and scaling up, and she integrates the new insights from this process with existing thinking. A new typology of approaches to scaling up is proposed, and key elements of scaling up are described and discussed, as are issues such as risks entailed in growth, motivation for scaling up and the special challenges related to scaling up work on HIV and AIDS. \"Making an Impact in HIV and AIDS\" is a contribution to thinking about scaling up NGO activities in general and is particularly important as the pressures of the HIV epidemic concern not only the organizations directly involved but also those working on all aspects of development.",

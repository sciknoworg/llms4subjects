            "abstract": "Dwelling on the Future focuses on the design of dwellings and their varied environments, and questions how an architect responds to the challenge of providing humane places in which to live for a growing, multifarious population in an increasingly divided world. The issue is never just housing. People \u2013 individuals, groups and societies \u2013 can and do have different goals and aspirations. Is it possible to imagine and implement a world in which a level of comfort and stability is available for even the poorest members of societies? Pierre d\u2019Avoine covers a wide range of examples, including proposals for luxury housing and designs for low-cost dwellings, which all address the needs and desires of their potential inhabitants. He explores an inclusive approach to the design of settlements \u2013 and not just in cities \u2013 that recognises difference, an approach that demands a fresh political vision to resolve humanity\u2019s increasing inequality, for the benefit of all. D\u2019Avoine asks if we can respond with optimism to the Kabakovs\u2019 mordantly titled installation \u2018Not Everyone Will Be Taken Into the Future (2001)\u2019. While this was perhaps a statement of fact in Russia and elsewhere in the Soviet Union during the Cold War, it is implicit, and ever more so, in the West today. Praise for Dwelling on the Future 'Beautifully judged line drawings, physical models and critical texts ...supplemented here by interviews that he has conducted with the full range of project partners. These illuminate the rich, diverse and often idiosyncratic contexts within which housing in the UK is produced and prove that good housing is not merely a socio-technical process. The resulting proposals suggest the triumph of possibility over regulatory limitation ...As the Welsh Government\u2019s laudable Innovative Housing Programme progresses, Dwelling on the Future illustrates the value of different ways of thinking and acting.' Touchstone: The journal for architecture in Wales \u2018The merits of the images [in paperback] out perform the on-screen version.\u2019Construction Expert, Russia \u2018In the modern world, with its growing speed and increasingly widespread clip-based thinking, it is rare to find an architect's book about architecture in which text prevails over images. \u2026Dwelling on the Future is also unusual in that it is based not on a text by the architect about his projects, but on a series of interviews with those who were involved in them. \u2026The book should be of interest to anyone who is curious about the origins of architectural ideas, projects and the process of their implementation.\u2019 Gleb A. Sobolev '\u2018The ultimate problem for the profession is that of setting out the possibilities and choices in building and environment.\u2019 - Architect and educator Leslie Martin (1967) In this valuable book[the] projects, individually and in sum, are \u2018possibilities and choices\u2019 for housing in the 21st century.'

                "Build and maintain effective, collaborative, and motivated software development teams. This book addresses the challenges in doing so, like communication gaps, trust issues, and motivation problems, and provides strategies to overcome them. You'll be introduced to the Radical Therapy Dev philosophy, a holistic approach designed to optimize software development teams for better performance and overall well-being. This book highlights common pain points in software development and offers solutions to resolving much of the issues in teams. It offers strategies for implementation, focusing on adaptability and accountability, while also promoting community-supported standards. And the book reveals why an emphasis on fostering a growth mindset, mentorship programs, and junior-intern initiatives promotes continuous learning and collaboration. With the rise of remote work, you'll see why hiring globally while thinking locally is gaining popularity. You'll also gain insights into removing barriers to remote work, along with tools and policies for remote collaboration. Additionally, the book explores the concept of cloud-native software development and its benefits. Radical Therapy for Software Development Teams critiques the traditional \"agile\" methodology, identifying its shortcomings while extracting valuable lessons that can still be applied effectively. You will: Address communication gaps, foster trust, and nurture a growth mindset among team members Avoid common feedback mistakes, recognize accomplishments, and implement a reward system Improve software development practices and team dynamics Take a scientific approach to project management rather than traditional requirements gathering."

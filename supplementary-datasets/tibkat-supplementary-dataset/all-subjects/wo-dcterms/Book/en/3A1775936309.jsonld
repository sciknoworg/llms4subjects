It highlights some of the most important applied research on the applications of tissue engineering along with its different components, specifically different types of biomaterials. It looks at the various issues involved in tissue engineering, including smart polymeric biomaterials, gene therapy, tissue engineering in reconstruction and regeneration of visceral organs, skin tissue engineering, bone and muscle regeneration, and applications in tropical medicines. Covering a wide range of issues in tissue engineering, the volume Provides an overview of the efficacy of the different biomaterials employed in tissue engineering (such as skin regeneration, nerve regeneration, artificial blood vessels, bone regeneration). Looks at smart polymeric biomaterials in tissue engineering Discusses the hybrid approach of tissue engineering in conjunction with gene therapy Explores using tissue engineering in the management of tropical diseases Considers various skin tissue engineering applications, including wound healing methods, skin substitutes and other materials Reports on the use of various biomaterials in bone and muscle regeneration Describes the use of tissue engineering in reconstruction and regeneration of visceral organs Covers polysaccharides and proteins-based hydrogels for tissue engineering applications Providing an abundance of advanced research and information, Tissue Engineering: Applications and Advancements will be a valuable resource for medical researchers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare personnel, and academicians\"--",

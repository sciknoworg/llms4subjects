            "abstract": "Numerical Simulations of Physical and Engineering Process is an edited book divided into two parts. Part I devoted to Physical Processes contains 14 chapters, whereas Part II titled Engineering Processes has 13 contributions. The book handles the recent research devoted to numerical simulations of physical and engineering systems. It can be treated as a bridge linking various numerical approaches of two closely inter-related branches of science, i.e. physics and engineering. Since the numerical simulations play a key role in both theoretical and application oriented research, professional reference books are highly needed by pure research scientists, applied mathematicians, engineers as well post-graduate students. In other words, it is expected that the book will serve as an effective tool in training the mentioned groups of researchers and beyond",

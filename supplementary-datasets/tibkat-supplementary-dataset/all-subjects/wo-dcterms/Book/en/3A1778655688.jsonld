            "abstract": "David Pol presents an ontology of war in the form of the lyric poem. \u201cDo you hear what I\u2019m shooting at you?\u201d In I Open Fire, all relation is warfare. Minefields compromise movement. Intention aims. Touch burns. Sex explodes bodies. Time ticks in bomb countdowns. Sound is sirens. Plenitude is debris. All of it under surveillance. \u201cMy world is critically injured. It was ambushed.\u201d The poems in this book perform the reductions and repetitions endemic to war itself, each one returning the reader to the same, unthinkable place in which the range of human experience has been so flattened that, despite all the explosive action, \u201cAlmost nothing is happening.\u201d Against this backdrop, we continue to fall in love. But Pol\u2019s poems remind us that this is no reason for optimism. Does love offer a delusional escape from war, or are relationships the very definition of combat? These poems take up the themes of love, sex, marriage, touch, hope \u2014 in short, the many dimensions of interpersonal connection \u2014 in a world in unprecedentedly critical condition. \u201cAnd when the night goes off the shock wave throws us apart toward each other.\u201d",

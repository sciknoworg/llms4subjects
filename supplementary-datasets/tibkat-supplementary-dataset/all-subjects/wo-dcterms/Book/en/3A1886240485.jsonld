                "This book offers a comprehensive overview of current debates on the influence of the Olympic Games on cities, urban policies and the governance of global cities, making a valuable contribution to the fields of Olympic studies and urban studies. Historically, Western cities such as Paris, London, and later Los Angeles, have been the primary hosts of the summer Games. However, the link that existed between the world metropolises of the last century and the Games has deeply changed. Growing concerns about the Games' costs and environmental impact have prompted a shift in the expectations of candidate cities and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). This evolution favours more modest bids, and a resurgence of global cities and historical Olympic host cities within the Olympic landscape. This book is an essential resource for researchers in Olympic studies, urban studies, and all those involved in the planning of these events. Alexandre Faure is Associate Researcher at the France-Japan Foundation of the EHESS. His research focuses on the study and analysis of the influence of the Olympic Games on cities, as well as on the link between global cities and the Olympic Games. .",

            "abstract": "During the many years of its publication and subsequent revisions, Paul Jellinek's book has been the standard work on its subject. This new edition, translated into English for the first time, was conceived in response to the increased interest in recent years in perfumes and the sense of smell. This interest has come not only from within the highly competitive perfumery industry, but also from psychologists and market researchers. The original text has impressively withstood the test of time and the approach of this new book has been to supplement it with chapters that are now of critical importance, but which were only touched upon in the original book. A market researcher looks at why people use perfumes; a psychologist examines the motivation of perfume choice; another psychologist discusses odours and a perfumer looks at the effects of odours on human experience and behaviour. In the final chapter the editor compares the original author's views with those of today's experts and suggests which aspects are still valid and in what areas divergent views now prevail. This book is written principally to provide a scientific basis to the craft of perfumery and to enable formulators and marketeers to understand why the smells they create and sell have the effect they do. It allows a systematic approach to the development of these products. Others outside the industry, including psychologists in academia, will find the book an essential reference source",

                "\"Offering a cutting-edge analysis of competitive balance and outcome uncertainty, this book explores the topic from multiple perspectives. Chapters address competitive balance and outcome uncertainty in different sports in a range of countries to help understand its significance. Highlighting important new insights into previously unexplored dimensions, the book also provides a rich context for better understanding why fans, teams and leagues value competitive balance. It challenges readers to think about the topic in a broad and rigorous way, and in some cases to question widely held beliefs about how outcome uncertainty motivates competitive balance and how sports fans actually view competitive balance. Key case studies and the use of new data in the chapters makes this an interesting read for sports economics researchers and students looking for current analysis of the topic. Managers of sports organizations will also appreciate the insights that the book gives into what their customers value\"--",

This multidisciplinary field of research extends the current capabilities of standard integrated circuits in terms of materials and designs and complements them by creating innovative components and smaller systems that require lower power consumption and display better performance. Novel Advances in Microsystems Technologies and their Applications delves into the state of the art and the applications of microsystems and microelectronics-related technologies.Featuring contributions by academic and industrial researchers from around the world, this book:Examines organic and flexible electronics, from polymer solar cell to flexible interconnects for the co-integration of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) with complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS)Discusses imaging and display technologies, including MEMS technology in reflective displays, the fabrication of thin-film transistors on glass substrates, and new techniques to display and quickly transmit high-quality imagesExplores sensor technologies for sensing electrical currents and temperature, monitoring structural health and critical industrial processes, and moreCovers biomedical microsystems, including biosensors, point-of-care devices, neural stimulation and recording, and ultra-low-power biomedical systemsWritten for researchers, engineers, and graduate students in electrical and biomedical engineering, this book reviews groundbreaking technology, trends, and applications in microelectronics. Its coverage of the latest research serves as a source of inspiration for anyone interested in further developing microsystems technologies and creating new applications\"--",

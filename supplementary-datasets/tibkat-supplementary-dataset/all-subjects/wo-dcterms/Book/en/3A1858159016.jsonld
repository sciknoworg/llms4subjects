            "abstract": [
                "In recent years, wireless networks communication has become the fundamental basis of our work, leisure, and communication life from the early GSM mobile phones to the Internet of Things and Internet of Everything communications. All wireless communications technologies such as Bluetooth, NFC, wireless sensors, wireless LANs, ZigBee, GSM, and others have their own challenges and security threats. This book addresses some of these challenges focusing on the implication, impact, and mitigations of the stated issues. The book provides a comprehensive coverage of not only the technical and ethical issues presented by the use of wireless networks but also the adversarial application of wireless networks and its associated implications. The authors recommend a number of novel approaches to assist in better detecting, thwarting, and addressing wireless challenges and threats. The book also looks ahead and forecasts what attacks can be carried out in the future through the malicious use of the wireless networks if sufficient defenses are not implemented. The research contained in the book fits well into the larger body of work on various aspects of wireless networks and cyber-security. The book provides a valuable reference for cyber-security experts, practitioners, and network security professionals, particularly those interested in the security of the various wireless networks. It is also aimed at researchers seeking to obtain a more profound knowledge in various types of wireless networks in the context of cyber-security, wireless networks, and cybercrime. Furthermore, the book is an exceptional advanced text for Ph.D. and master\u2019s degree programs in cyber-security, network security, cyber-terrorism, and computer science who are investigating or evaluating a security of a specific wireless network. Each chapter is written by an internationally-renowned expert who has extensive experience in law enforcement, industry, or academia. Furthermore, this book blends advanced research findings with practice-based methods to provide the reader with advanced understanding and relevant skills.",

                "This open access volume analyses the challenges, problems and solutions of startups in times of global crises. It, first, provides an overview of the principles and fundamentals of successful entrepreneurship and startup development and talks about important resilience factors for meaningful entrepreneurship. Then, it analyses the findings and events that have come to light during the Covid-19 crisis and the Ukraine war. The volume discusses examples of successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurship for startups and small businesses in various Asian countries and thereby also provides an international perspective. Against these discussions, the contributors talk about possible the political framework conditions for successful entrepreneurship. The volume overall provides experts in the fields of organizational studies, well-being and resilience research, economic policy, economic promotion, and science with a useful resource that condenses and summarizes current economic crises, financial crises and political crises from the perspective of entrepreneurship. The findings produced here are the result of many years of international research cooperation between the contributors and the editor."

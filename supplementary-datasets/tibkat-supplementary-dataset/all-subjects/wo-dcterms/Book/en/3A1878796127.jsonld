            "abstract": "\"Renewable energy is crucial to preserve the environment. Energy involving various systems must be optimized and assessed to provide better performance. However, the design and development of renewable energy systems remains a challenge. Advanced optimization techniques play a crucial role in implementing the latest innovative research in the field of renewable energy integrated electrical systems. This book also provides practical challenges encountered and solutions adopted in the fields of renewable energy integrated systems. Applications of varieties of advanced optimization techniques on the design and development of renewable energy integrated systems have been discussed to provide new solutions to the renewable energy domain. Topics such as micro grids, wind power, solar photo voltaic (PV), optimal power flow (OPF), small magnetic energy storage (SMES) device, radial distribution system, hydrothermal scheduling problem, economic-emission load dispatch and advanced optimization techniques are ideal for engineers, industry professionals, researchers, academicians, practitioners, teachers, and students\"--",

            "abstract": "Koji Sugioka is a senior research scientist in RIKEN and a guest professor of Tokyo University of Science and Tokyo Denki University. Since he joined RIKEN in 1986, he has worked on laser microprocessing of various materials. His current interests center on the development of advanced laser microprocessing techniques performing surface and 3-D microstructuring of transparent materials, with applications to biophotonic microchip devices. He received several awards for his research and inventions in the area of laser microprocessing. He published over 110 articles in international journals and over 70 papers in priceedings, gave more than 60 invited talks at international conferences and more than 70 invited talks at domestic conferences, and has more than 20 patents or pending patents. He has served conference chair, co-chair, and committee member in numerous international conferences. He is also editor-in-chief of the Journal of Laser Micro/Nanoengineering (JLMN). Michel Meunier is professor of engineering physics at \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al and holds the Canada Research Chair in Laser micro/nano-engineering of materials. He obtained his PhD from MIT in 1984 for his work on laser induced chemical vapor deposition of thin films. His current interest is in ultrafast laser-materials interaction and application of laser micro/nanoprocessing in microelectronics, optoelectronics, biomedical and nanotechnologies. He received the Synergy Price for the Canadian Government for his outstanding collaboration with a laser processing industry. He published over 250 papers in international journals and proceedings and gave more than 35 invited talks in international conferences. He is one of the editor of the Journal of Laser Micro/Nanoengineering (JLMN). Alberto Piqu\u00e9 is Head of the Electronic and Optical Materials  Devices Section, in the Materials Science Division at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Since joining the NRL in 1997, he has investigated the use of laser-based direct-write techniques for the rapid prototyping of microelectronics, sensors and micro-power sources. His research interests include the study of processes involving laser-material interactions, in particular those relevant to pulsed laser deposition and laser forward transfer as applied to the fabrication of thin-films, multilayers and embedded structures. He has published over 130 scientific articles, presented over 35 invited talks, co-edited a book in Direct-Write Technologies and holds 15 U.S. patents with 10 more pending in laser materials processing. He is an associate editor of the Journal of Laser Micro/Nanoengineering (JLMN).",

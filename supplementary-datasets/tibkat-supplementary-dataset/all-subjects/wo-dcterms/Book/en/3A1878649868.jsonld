                "This book focuses on novel technologies related to food processing technology and engineering. It also focuses on food safety, quality and management, the scope of the Internet of Things (IoT) in food processing and its management, bioengineering tools for crop improvement in agriculture, recent innovations in food packaging, nanotechnology in food processing, and the nutritional health benefits of food. 3D printed food, an interesting and increasingly popular concept among the public today, is a meal prepared through an automated additive process using 3D food printers. This book is a ready reference for food researchers, students, and industry professionals. The book updates the current scenario of food processing technology and engineering for readers from agriculture and its allied fields including students and researchers of food science and technology, dairy science and technology, packaging industry, people working in food safety organisations, and researchers in the field of nanotechnology.",

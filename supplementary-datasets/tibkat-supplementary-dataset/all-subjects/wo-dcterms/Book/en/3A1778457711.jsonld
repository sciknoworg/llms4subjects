            "abstract": "Russia seems to be back in many \u201cold\u201d theatres where the Soviet Union was actively engaged. More than a quarter of a century after the fall of the USSR, it is clear that Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin has made restoring Russia\u2019s great power status a primary goal of his twenty years in power. Political and historical links dating back to the Cold War have been capitalised upon to build fresh partnerships and cement or re-establish Russia\u2019s influence in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Just as the Soviet Union supported Western communist parties and ran disinformation campaigns, today\u2019s Russia is accused of meddling with the electoral processes of several Western countries. What are the elements of continuity and change when comparing Russia\u2019s foreign policy with the Soviet Union\u2019s? This ISPI Report tackles the political, historical, military and economic dimensions of Russia\u2019s return to old Soviet theatres of influence. In particular, it delves into their implications for the development of the multipolar world order long-advocated by Moscow",

                "Everything flows, so rheology is a universal science. Even if we set aside claims of such width, there can be no doubt of its importance in polymers. It joins with chemistry in the polymerisation step but polymer engineering is supreme in all the succeeding steps. This is the area concerned with the fabrication of the polymer into articles or components, with their design to meet the needs in service, and with the long and short term performance of the article or component. This is a typical area of professional engineering activity, but one as yet without its proper complement of professional engineers. An understanding of polymer rheology is the key to effective design and material plus process selection, to efficient fabrication, and to satisfactory service, yet few engineers make adequate use of what is known and understood in polymer rheology. Its importance in the flow processes of fabrication is obvious. Less obvious, but equally important, are the rheological phenomena which determine the in-service performance. There is a gap between the polymer rheologist and the polymer engineer which is damaging to both parties and which contributes to a less than satisfactory use of polymers in our society. It is important that this gap be filled and this book makes an attempt to do so. It presents an outline of what is known in a concise and logical fashion. It does this starting from first principles and with the minimum use of complex mathematics."

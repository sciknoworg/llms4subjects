                "\"Preface Solid-state fermentation (SSF) is one of the oldest microbial technologies that have been applied in food processing, although neglected for a long time. SSF technology was originated from China dating back thousands of years. For the past ten years, SSF has again attracted much attention, due to energy crisis and environmental pollution. Scientists are trying to explore the mechanisms in the fermentation process through multidisciplinary and different research tools. Based on a series of established mathematical models, new design concept for SSF bioreactors and process control strategies have been proposed, which make SSF technology to reach new levels. Food and beverage production is an important application field of SSF technology, which has been received widespread interest. This book systematically describes the production of solid-state fermented food and beverage in terms of the history and development of SSF technology and SSF foods, bio-reactor design, fermentation process, various substrate origins and sustainable development. More emphasis has been allocated to describe Oriental traditional foods produced by SSF in Chapters 6, 8, and 9, such as sufu, vinegar, soy sauce, Chinese distilled spirit and rice wine. This is a special book for understanding Oriental traditional foods. In addition, this book has comprehensively incorporated the latest development and achievements in the field of SSF. \"--",
                "\"This is the first book about fermented food and beverage to focus on solid-state fermentation. The text describes the various reactors used in solid-state fermentation, including static state reactors, dynamic reactors, and other new types of reactors, and provides a detailed introduction to various solid-state fermented foods and beverages, including product category, characteristics, functionalities, safety issues and consumer perception. The authors address such engineering issues as mass and heat transfer and energy equation calculation of solid-state fermentation, dynamic modeling of solid-state fermentation, and process control of solid-state fermentation. \"--"

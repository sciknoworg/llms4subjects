            "abstract": "\"This book is about the cooperation of AIAA and IEEE, two major engineering organizations from two distinct focus points of technologies: intelligent aero-engine and electrified aviation. AIAA and IEEE both have their intrinsic needs for each other and their co-working is a must-have in the rest of 21st century. AIAA needs IEEE to become smarter and greener and IEEE needs a much broader scope to enlarge its marketplace and playground. The topics related to AIAA's and IEEE's co-project are highly multi- and inter-disciplinary related and highly goal-oriented. The target audience of this book is IEEE, AIAA members and other related professionals from universities, industries and institutes in the fields of AI-driven smart systems and electric airplanes with the associated new electric aero-engines and mobile aviation electric powers.\"--",

                "\"The cultural and political contexts in the U.S. today allow for individual tactics of resistance to co-exist with collective identities and shared desires for social change. This groundbreaking book examines this tension between the individual and the collective by looking at \"lifestyle politics,\" or the attempt by individuals to enact their political ideologies in their daily life. Drawing on feminism and other radical movements that claim that \"the personal is political,\" the book explores how anarchist activists position their own lifestyle within strategies of radical political resistance. A variety of lifestyle practices, from personal consumption to self representation and sexuality is studied to address questions of identity and cultural practices as tools of political dissent. An accessible and provocative text, Lifestyle Politics and Radical Activism blends theory with empirical materials to highlight issues that are important not only to anarchists, but also to anyone engaged in social activism. This unique analysis of activism will contribute to the development of anarchist theory and practice and will appeal to anyone interested in political activism and social movements\"--",
                "\"Attempts by people to enact their political beliefs in their daily lives have become commonplace in contemporary US culture, in spheres ranging from shopping habits to romantic attachments. This groundbreaking book examines how collective social movements have cultivated individual practices of \"lifestyle politics\" as part of their strategies of resistance, and the tensions they must navigate in doing so. Drawing on feminism and other movements that claim that \"the personal is political,\" the book explores how radical anarchist activists position their own lifestyles within projects of resistance. Various lifestyle practices, from consumption to personal style to sexual relationships, are studied to address how identity and cultural practices can be used as tools of political dissent.An accessible and provocative text, Lifestyle Politics and Radical Activism blends theory with empirical materials to highlight issues that are important not only to anarchists, but also to anyone struggling for social change.

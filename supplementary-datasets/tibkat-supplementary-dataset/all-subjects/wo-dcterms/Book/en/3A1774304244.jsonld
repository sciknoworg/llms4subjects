            "title": "Identification for Development Country Diagnostic : Rwanda",
            "abstract": "Over the last decade Rwanda has developed an exemplary identification ecosystem and has accumulated practical knowledge and experience that deserve to be shared with other African nations who may find it useful and inspiring as they attempt to build their own identification schemes. While the report is based on in-country research and interviews with identity stakeholders, conducted by the author in support of an official development program in early 2015, it is an independent outcome. It is issued by ID4Africa in the spirit of documenting and promoting knowledge transfer of good practices among African nations. It did not seek official approval or endorsement from any government or development agency. The author remains responsible for the opinions expressed herein, and for any inaccuracies or omissions that may have slipped through, for which apologies are presented in advance. This report is organized as follows: Section 1 gives the essential guide to identity ecosystems and what matters in identity. Section 2 provides a holistic overview of what exists in Rwanda and how the elements relate to one another. Sections 3, 4, and 5 provide a detailed description of the foundational identity registers and schemes, such as the civil register and the National population register, the National identity (NID) card, and the Ubudehe social register. Section 6 provides lessons learned for consideration aimed at other African identity authorities desirous of building or reinforcing their legal identity ecosystems. Finally, the Annex gives, for reference, a summary of the legal framework governing the identity ecosystem in Rwanda",

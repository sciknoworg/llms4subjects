                "\u201cFinally, a book that asks the core forward-looking question overlooked in most analyses of the crises the EU has faced over the past decade: who learned what lesson, and to what effect? Using the case of the Eurozone crisis, the answers Kamkhaji provides are a crucial read for everyone interested in the process of European integration, crisis management and policy-making in general.\u201d \u2014Femke van Esch, Professor of European Governance and Leadership of the EU, Utrecht University, the Netherlands. This book analyzes the EU\u2019s responses to the sovereign debt crisis that hit the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2010. After reviewing the events that led to the crisis, it examines two case studies. The first assesses the short-term policy changes by drawing on a new mechanism, contingent learning. The second case study revolves around the long-term EMU reforms passed during the period 2010-2013. More specifically, it assesses these responses in relation to the institutional scientific publications of the European Central Bank and the DG ECFIN of the Commission. By analyzing both the short and long-term responses to the sovereign debt crisis, the book elucidates how policy learning can be an effective engine for deeper European integration. It will be of interest to scholars and students of EU integration, the EMU, policy learning, and supranational bureaucracies. Jonathan C. Kamkhaji is a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the Department of Management, Economics and Industrial Engineering, Politecnico Milano, Italy. His research interests include European integration, public policy, and regulatory governance. He previously worked as a consultant for the World Bank, and has published research in the Journal of European Public Policy, Regulation & Governance, and Policy Studies Journal. .",

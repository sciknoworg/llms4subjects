                "This book was written with a dual purpose, as a reference book for practicing engineers and as a textbook for students of prestressed concrete. It represents the fifth generation of books on this subject written by its author. Significant additions and revisions have been made in this edition. Chapters 2 and 3 contain new material intended to assist the engineer in understanding factors affecting the time-dependent properties of the reinforcement and concrete used in prestressing concrete, as well as to facilitate the evaluation of their effects on prestress loss and deflection. Flexural strength, shear strength, and bond of prestressed concrete members were treated in a single chapter in the of flexural strength has third edition. Now, in the fourth edition, the treatment been expanded, with more emphasis on strain compatibility, and placed in Chapter 5 which is devoted to this subject alone. Chapter 6 of this edition, on flexural-shear strength, torsional strength, and bond of prestressed reinforce\u00ad ment, was expanded to include discussions of Compression Field Theory and torsion that were not treated in the earlier editions. In similar fashion, expanded discussions of loss of prestress, deflection, and partial prestressing now are presented separately, in Chapter 7. Minor additions and revisions have been made to the material contained in the remaining chapters with the exception of xv xvi I PREFACE Chapter 17. This chapter, which is devoted to construction considerations, has important new material on constructibility and tolerances as related to prestressed concrete.",

Topics discussed include the measurement of the distribution of wealth and analyses the time trends in wealth concentration and the importance of the role of inheritance. Theoretical approaches, including both stochastic and behavioural models are also explored. The Review further investigates the determinants of saving and bequests whilst also highlighting key life cycle and permanent income studies, as well as the role of entrepreneurship and taxation",

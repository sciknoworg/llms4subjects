            "abstract": "Clinical usage of artificial pacing dates back to 1958, when the battery powered cardiac pacemakers became available. Modern implantable pacemakers are the complicated electronic devices operating 10 years continuously without battery exchange. Though the development of devices is not a primary topic of the book, certain efforts towards developing of biologic pacemakers through tissue engineering and studying of cell synchronization are discussed. The main attention is paid to implementations of pacemakers in different medical situations oriented towards widening the clinical indications for implanting the cardiac pacemakers. New methods and devices in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) have received particular attention. Placing of pacing electrodes has been treated soundly. Furthermore, emerging of complexities and complications in new clinical situations and other safety problems have been discussed thoroughly. The authors have derived the used information from their own clinical practice and experiences of their medical colleagues. These and other pragmatic features can be acknowledged as the most valuable asset of the book",

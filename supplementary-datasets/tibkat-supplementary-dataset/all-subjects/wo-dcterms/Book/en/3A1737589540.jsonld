                "This brief covers case studies on Microbial Induced Corrosion (MIC) and its mitigation. After reviewing the basics of corrosion, it focuses on MIC. MIC is a special type of electrochemical corrosion in which the presence of microbes and bacteria alters the chemistry of liquid media so as to make them more corrosive. These changes are harmful to metallic equipment, processing machinery, marine vessels, etc. in an environment that is host to a wealth of microorganisms. A 2007 US survey estimated corrosion-related damages to cost $276 billion a year, roughly 50% of which are due to MIC. The industries most affected by MIC are power production, oil exploration, transportation and storage, water distribution and more generally all industries involving marine environments. However, means for effectively preventing and controlling MIC are poorly understood. As such, the books later chapters address various mechanisms/processes that show promise with regard to MIC mitigation. Lastly, the book discusses the strategies currently being explored to mitigate MIC using green technologies"

            "abstract": [
                "This book explores the history of the nuclear nonproliferation dialogue between Russia (USSR) and the United States. By looking into the particulars of bilateral cooperation on NPT, Cooperative Threat Reduction program, arms control, and other issues, the authors offer lessons to be learned in preventing nuclear confrontations in the future. The book has been prepared in coordination between Russian and American scholars and experts and is a result of a series of Track 2.5 events devoted to restoring the nonproliferation cooperation between Russia and the United States. Covering all the aspects of the bilateral partnership since 1960 until today, this book will interest scholars of great power conflicts and nonproliferation. The workshop and the consequent work on the monograph became possible thanks to generous organizational & financial support from Centre russe d`etudes politiques (Geneva) and the Center for Policy Studies in Russia (Monterey, USA). Dr.Vladimir A.Orlov is expert in international security and Russia\u2019s foreign policy. Dr. Orlov is the PIR Center\u2019s Director and founder, as well as member of its Executive Board. Dr. Orlov is Professor at MGIMO University (since 2017) where he teaches Russian foreign and security policy as well as nuclear non-proliferation (since 2013). He has also been part of UN Secretary General's Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters from 2014-2018. Dr. Orlov is Founder (1993) & President of the Trialogue Club International. Mr.Semenov D. Semenov graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) in 2019. Since 2019, he has worked in the PIR Center as a coordinator of the \u201cRussia and Nuclear Nonproliferation\u201d program and a research fellow. .",

            "title": "Walking the talk : Reimagining primary health care after COVID-19",
            "abstract": "Very few topics in global health have been as controversial as primary health care since it was introduced half a century ago as the panacea for providing health care to the masses. Yet the debate continues because of the controversy over what it really means, how it should be conceptualized, and how healthcare systems could walk the talk to make it the cornerstone of health services delivery. In this book the authors focus on what it takes to reimagine primary health care in the 21st century, an era of increasing and rapidly changing health care needs, population expectations, availability of financial and human resources, and technology, both medical and digital. They propose an innovative unifying framework bringing together four requirements to reimagine primary health care and ensure a transition from: (i) a limited package of low-quality services to a broader range of higher quality primary care and public health services; (ii) fragmented care to person-centered integrated care; (iii) inequity in access to fairness and accountability regardless of one's ability and willingness to pay; and (iv) fragility to resilience, particularly in times of pent-up demand as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. They present three areas of reform focusing on modalities of service delivery: health work force production, fit-for-purpose deployment and retention; and resource allocation and compensation schemes to \"walk the talk\" for high quality, integrated, continuous, comprehensive, and community-oriented primary health care. Key takeaways include team-based organization and service delivery, training and licensing to acquire the right mix of skills and competencies, and compensating the level of effort and engagement accordingly. Finally, the authors indicate how the World Bank Group and its development partners could join efforts to help countries deliver on reimagined primary health care through technical advice and financial assistance for global- and country-level dialogue for advocacy--",

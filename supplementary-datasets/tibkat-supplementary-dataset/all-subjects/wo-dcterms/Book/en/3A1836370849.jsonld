            "abstract": "Flash + Cube (1965-1975) is an artist\u2019s book about the Sylvania flashcube \u2014 the space-aged, flash photography device, revolutionary in 1965 and nearly obsolete by 1975. Assembled from a wide range of archival materials \u2014 a \u201cterrorist letter,\u201d G.I. photographs from Vietnam, Sylvania flashcube advertisements, as well as Long\u2019s photographs and photomontages\u2014the book explores the links between light, war, history and photography.  Apart from its circulation as a novelty item online, the flashcube is largely forgotten. The history of photographic flash is also often relegated to a footnote and is strikingly under-analyzed. Yet flash\u2019s blinding effects and military genealogy, and the flashcube\u2019s precise contemporaneity with the war in Vietnam make this a rich analytical object with which to reflect on the cultural, political and economic imperatives of its moment. As Long\u2019s deft work with this archive shows, the flashcube is good to think with",

            "title": "Essays in Honour of Eamonn Cantwell : Yeats Annual No. 20",
            "abstract": "\"This number of Yeats Annual collects the essays resulting from the University College Cork/ESB International Annual W. B. Yeats Lectures Series (2003-2008) by Roy Foster, Warwick Gould, John Kelly, Paul Muldoon, Bernard O\u2019Donoghue and Helen Vendler. Those that were available in pamphlet form are now collectors\u2019 items, but here is the complete series. These revised essays cover such themes as Yeats and the Refrain, Yeats as a Love Poet, Yeats, Ireland and Europe, the puzzles he created and solved with his art of poetic sequences, and his long and crucial interaction with the emerging T. S. Eliot. The series was inaugurated by a study of Yeats and his Books, which marked the gift to the Boole Library, Cork, of Dr Eamonn Cantwell\u2019s collection of rare editions of books by Yeats (here catalogued by Cr\u00f3n\u00e1n \u00d3 Doibhlin). Many of the volume\u2019s fifty-six plates offer images of artists\u2019 designs and resulting first editions. This bibliographical theme is continued with Colin Smythe\u2019s census of surviving copies of Yeats\u2019s earliest separate publication, Mosada (1886) and a resultant piece by Warwick Gould on that dramatic poem\u2019s source in the legend of the Phantom Ship. John Kelly reveals Yeats\u2019s ghost-writing for Sarah Allgood; Geert Lernout discovers the source for Yeats\u2019s \u2018Tulka\u2019, G\u00fcnther Schmigalle unearths his surprising connexions with American communist colonists in Virginia, while Deirdre Toomey edits some new letters to the French anarchist, Auguste Hamon\u2014all providing new annotation for standard editions. The volume is rounded with review essays by Colin McDowell (on A Vision, and Yeats, Hone and Berkeley), shorter reviews of current studies by Michael Edwards, Jad Adams and Deirdre Toomey, and obituaries of Jon Stallworthy (Nicolas Barker) and Katharine Worth (Richard Cave). \"",

            "abstract": "\"Freshwater is used primarily for sustenance as well as in various industries such as mining, agriculture, and power generation, among a slew of other purposes for enabling today's high living standards. From the involved industries listed in Figure 1.1, it is shown that irrigation consumes the most water among the various activities[1]. Maintaining a proper supply of water is of foremost importance to ensuring optimal conditions for managing livestock and raising crops, both vital for directly influencing the wellness of the general population and serving the economic purpose. Outside of agriculture, lack of freshwater can also affect industries by ultimately lessening the quality of its product, be it material or energy related. Climate change and population growth have significantly altered global water resources in the 20th century and are likely to pose more challenges in the future. Groundwater is an essential source of freshwater, meeting the domestic needs of about half of the global population. Roughly 38% of global consumptive irrigation water demand is met by groundwater. Depletion of groundwater is significant in most of the irrigated regions in the world where millions of people reside [2]. In areas where surface water such as lakes and rivers are scarce or inaccessible, groundwater supplies much of the habitant's hydrologic needs. In the United States, it is the source of drinking water for about half the total population and nearly all of the rural population, and provides over 50 billion gallons per day for agricultural needs. Groundwater depletion, a term often defined as long-term water-level declines caused by sustained groundwater pumping, is a key issue associated with groundwater use. Many areas of the United States are experiencing groundwater depletion, which can result in water table lowering, leading to the reduction of freshwater in streams and lakes [2]. While the expansion in groundwater-based irrigation helped meet the rising food demands of a growing population, it has resulted in several environmental implications. Groundwater depletion has now become one of the most prominent challenges for food and water security.\"--",

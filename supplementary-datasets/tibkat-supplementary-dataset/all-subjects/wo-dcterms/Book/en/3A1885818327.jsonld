                "Industrial engineers need to have a good foundation in the Six Sigma process to define needs, collect data, measure performance, analyze results, and improve operations in the workplace. This textbook covers the associated Six Sigma, lean, and technology-related concepts that an industrial engineer needs to understand to adopt the changes necessary to remove waste and increase productivity. The book introduces essential basic measurement tools and various process improvement methodologies, including total quality management (TQM), Six Sigma and the DMAIC approach, lean methodology, and Kaizen. Case studies and examples examine manufacturing, health care, and transportation services. Six Sigma and Quality Concepts for Industrial Engineers provides industrial engineering students and practitioners with a practical understanding of Six Sigma and manufacturing improvement concepts. Introduces crucial improvement tools and techniques; A compact introduction for industrial engineering students, professional development, and training courses; Explains concepts with examples, exercises, and case studies."

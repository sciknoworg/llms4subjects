            "title": "Beloved Lady : A History of Jane Addams' Ideas on Reform and Peace",
            "abstract": "Originally published in 1967. Jane Addams was one of the most creative thinkers and activists in the history of American social reform. She pioneered the settlement house movement. She was a leader in the attempt to relate education to the new urban environment for millions of Americans in the early twentieth century. She was a vocal advocate of the Progressive movement and active in the drive for women's rights. She was also an outstanding spokesman for international understanding and world peace. Although Jane Addams is well known as one of the originators of social work in the United States, as an early advocate of a \"War on Poverty,\" and as the proponent of ideas that led to the creation of the modern welfare state, the convictions that motivated her prodigious energy had not, prior to Dr. Farrell's investigation, been carefully examined. He traces the relation between her philanthropic principles and her Progressive politics, her feminism, and her efforts to achieve world peace. He shows how her association with John Dewey and her acceptance of pragmatism changed her thinking and also how her later pacifism alienated her from many progressives of various persuasions. Before his sudden and untimely death at the age of thirty-two, John C. Farrell had just completed this study, based on his examination of virtually every important writing by and about Jane Addams. It is not a full-fledged biography but rather an intellectual history that seeks to explain the origins and relevance of Jane Addams' ideas and activities to the first half of the twentieth century. The manuscript for this book, complete but unrevised, was edited for publication by two of Farrell's colleagues who prefer to remain unidentified. Charles C. Barker, professor of history at Johns Hopkins University, wrote an introduction that places Beloved Lady in the context of scholarly literature on Jane Addams",

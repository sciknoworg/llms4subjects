                "This monograph presents an original, concise mathematical theory for bio-mimetic swimmers in the framework of a coupled system of PDEs and ODEs. The authoritative research pioneered by the author serves as the basis for the method adopted here. This unique methodology consists of an original modelling approach, well-posedness results for the proposed models for swimmers, and a controllability theory that studies the steering potential of the proposed swimmers. A combination of this sort does not currently exist in the literature, making this an indispensable resource. Structured in five parts, the author establishes the main modeling approach in Part One. Part Two then presents the well-posedness results for these models. Parts Three through Five serve to develop a controllability theory for the swimmers, which are conceived of as artificial mechanical devices that imitate the swimming motion of fish, eels, frogs, and other aquatic creatures in nature. Several illustrative examples are provided in the last portion that serve as potential research topics. Bio-Mimetic Swimmers in Incompressible Fluids will appeal to graduate students and researchers studying fluid dynamics and control theory, as well as engineers interested in these areas.",

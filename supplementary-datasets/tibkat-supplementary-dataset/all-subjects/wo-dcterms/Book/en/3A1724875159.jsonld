            "abstract": "One of the objectives of a GFDRR funded project in Armenia (Institutional Arrangements on Disaster Risk Management and Reduction) is awareness building among the decision makers, professional engineering and construction community, and local self-governments on the modern, anti-seismic technologies successfully developed and implemented in Armenia. To raise awareness on the seismic isolation technology it was decided to first evaluate the functioning of all seismic isolation systems in the already constructed buildings in Armenia. Then based on the carried out observations to analyze the results, to draw lessons from the findings and to present the conclusions and recommendations to the wider engineering and construction community, as well as to the decision makers in the construction industry. For that purpose monitoring and evaluation of the technical conditions of the seismic isolation systems in the buildings which were seismically isolated for more than a decade ago was carried out. This initiative was very useful, as it helped to answer to the frequently asked questions and concerns on the sustainability and effectiveness of the technology, of the seismic isolators. It also helped to draw lessons and recommend solutions for improving their construction and maintenance practices",

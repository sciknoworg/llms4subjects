            "abstract": "One of the first thing that comes to your mind after hearing the term \u201ccorrosion\u201d is corrosion of a metal. Corrosion is a basically harmful phenomenon, but it can be useful in some cases. For instance, environment\u2019s pollution with corrosion products and damage to the performance of a system are among its harmful effects, whereas electric energy generation in a battery and cathodic protection of many structures are among its advantages. However, these advantages are almost nothing as compared to the costs and effects imposed by its detrimental influences. The enormous costs of this phenomenon can be better understand through studying the published statistics on direct and indirect corrosion damages on economy of governments. The direct cost of corrosion is near 3 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) of USA. Considering this huge cost, it is necessary to develop and expand the corrosion science and its protection technologies",

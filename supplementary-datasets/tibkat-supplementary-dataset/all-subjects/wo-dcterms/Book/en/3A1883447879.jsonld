                "Cork-Based Materials in Engineering Applications provides a set of case studies investigating cork as an eco-friendly and sustainable engineering material. This natural material has had limited applications in engineering until recent years. Recent regulations by European authorities calling for reducing environmentally hazardous and non-recyclable materials have increased interest in cork-based science. Contributors look at cork-based engineering applications, including crashworthiness applications, anti-impact structures, energy-absorbing systems, and vibration-damping devices. Researchers, scientists, students, and practicing engineers working in advanced materials and natural composites will find this unique book an invaluable reference and introduction to the world of cork-based materials and applications. Provides a solid introduction to cork-based engineering applications; Examines cork-based materials as a sustainable resource; Includes case studies."

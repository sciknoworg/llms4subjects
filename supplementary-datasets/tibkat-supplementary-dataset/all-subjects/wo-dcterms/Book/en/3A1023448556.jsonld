                "For this insightful collection, Professor Reich has selected some of the most significant published articles on labor mobility and segmented markets. The book investigates the development of this important field from the pioneering papers on labor market segmentation analysis of the 1970s, through the early debates to the later theoretical models and econometric evidence. The second volume offers an overview of the evolution from segmentation to flexibility in labor markets up to the present day and explores topics such as the growth of temporary jobs in Europe, the influence of gender, immigration and race, later econometric controversies and the phenomenon of flexicurity. The volumes will be an essential resource for students and for scholars wishing to investigate this important area"

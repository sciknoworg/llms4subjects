                "Management approaches to merger evoked cultural change and acculturation outcomes / Marie H. Kavanagh, Neal M.

Jackson -- A reputational perspective on mergers / Gary Davies, Rosa Chun -- Dimensions of management style compatibility and cross-border acquisition outcome / Richard Schoenberg -- Acquisitions and intangible resources : reputations as a mobile and transferable asset / Todd Saxton -- Mergers and acquisitions and corporate governance / Anant K. Sundaram -- The managing executive in post-acquisition management / Duncan Angwin -- Ideal acquisition integration approaches in related acquisitions of equals : a test of long-held beliefs / Kimberly M. Ellis, Bruce T. Lamont -- Introduction / Cary L. Cooper, Sydney Finkelstein. - This is the third book in the series Advances in Mergers and Acquisitions, comprised of leading international scholars from a range of disciplines, who explore the economic, financial, strategic or organizational behaviour aspects of M & A's. Marie Kavanagh and Neal Ashkanasy explore how management approaches to mergers and acquisitions contribute to cultural change and acculturation outcomes. The issue of management is pursued further by Duncan Angwin in his chapter on the managing executive in post-acquisition management. Richard Schoenberg highlights the significance of management style compatibility and cross border acquisition outcomes. Randall Schuler, Ibraiz Tarique and Susan Jackson explore cross border alliances as well but from the point of view of managing human resources. The ideal acquisition integration approach is examined by Kimberly Ellis and Bruce Lamont in the context of a merger of equals which leads nicely to the corporate governance issues and M & A's explored by Anant Sundaram. The remaining chapters assess the returns of M & A's to the organization, with Laurence Capron and Jung-Chin Shen positing the acquirer returns when buying public v private firms, Todd Saxton's reputations as a mobile and transferable asset and Garry Davies and Rosa Chun's reputational perspective on mergers. These leading international academics contribute enormously to our understanding of the rapidly growing merger and acquisition field",

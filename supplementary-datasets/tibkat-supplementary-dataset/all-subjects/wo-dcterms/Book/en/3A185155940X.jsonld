                "\u201cThe collection offers a unique look at the expanding margins of human rights research and the collective effort to resist the decline of human flourishing, expression, and dignity. The deeper themes of hope and dignity make the book a must-read for anyone interested in the role of meaningful research in developing pathways forward in modern human rights contexts.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Richard Jochelson, Dean of Law at the Faculty of Law, University of Manitoba \u201cAn impressive collection of perspectives on a broad range of cutting-edge human rights issues from both well known and respected scholars, and emerging voices from the Master of Human Rights program at the University of Manitoba. This collection will undoubtedly influence the debates and practice in these areas, making it an incredible resource to both human rights practitioners and academics alike.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Nathan Derejko, Assistant Professor and Mauro Chair in Human Rights and Social Justice, University of Manitoba \u201cThis collection of essays furthers discussions of human rights issues on a wide range of contemporary topics that are relevant locally and globally. From restorative justice, to Indigeneity, to gender-based violence, to cyber operations, to environmental justice and beyond, each chapter provides an opportunity for rich dialogue when teaching contemporary human rights, making this an important and timely contribution to human rights research pedagogy.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Karlee Sapoznik Evans, BAH, MA, PhD, Deputy Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth In this book international scholars offer emergent human rights scholarship to investigate, agitate, and mobilize constructive social change.

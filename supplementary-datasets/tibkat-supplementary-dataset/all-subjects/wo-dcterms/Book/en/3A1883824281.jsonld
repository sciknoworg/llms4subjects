            "title": "Computational design for landscape architects",
            "abstract": "\"This book is a guide to computational design for landscape architects replete with extensive tutorials. It introduces algorithmic approaches to modeling, analyzing, and designing landscapes. The aim of this book is to use algorithms to understand and design landscape as a generative system, i.e. to harness the processes that shape landscape to generate new forms. An algorithmic approach to design is gently introduced through visual programming with Grasshopper, before more advanced methods for simulating landscape dynamics are taught in Python, a high level programming language. Topics discussed will include parametric design, lidar, drone photogrammetry, terrain modeling, geomorphometry, hydrologic simulation, digital fabrication, robotics, and more. Each chapter includes sections on theory, methods, and either visual programming or scripting. Online resources for the book will include video tutorials, sample code, and datasets so that readers can easily follow along and try out the methods presented. This book is a much needed guide, both theoretical and practical, on generative design and geospatial modeling for students, educators, and practitioners of landscape architecture\"--",

The book describes the original conceptual models of amphibious aircraft, ground-effect vehicles, hydrofoil vessels, and others, from theory to the full implementation in industrial applications. The developed models are presented with the design of passenger compartments and are actually ready for implementation in the aircraft industry. The originality of the concepts are based on biological prototypes, which are ergonomic, multifunctional and aesthetically pleasing. The aerodynamic layout of prospective convertible land and ship-based aircrafts of vertical and short takeoff-landing is presented, as well as the development of the original model of the unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone. The results of full-scale experiments are presented, including the technology of modeling aerospace simulators based on the virtual reality environment with technical vision devices. Whether for the practicing engineer in the field, the engineering student, or the scientist interested in new aerospace developments, this volume is a must-have\"--",

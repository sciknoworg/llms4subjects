            "abstract": "Intermediate Accounting by Donald Kieso, Jerry Weygandt, and Terry Warfield has always been, and continues to be, the gold standard. Through significant updates, the 18th Edition presents a refreshed, accessible, and modern approach with new perspectives that help connect students to the what, the why, and the how of accounting information. In the intermediate accounting course, it can be difficult for students to understand the technical details and retain and recall core course topics. To move beyond basic understanding, students work through new integrated practice right at the point of learning and high-quality assessment at varying levels, helping them to learn concepts more efficiently and create connections between topics and real-world application. Throughout the course, students also work through various hands-on activities including Critical Thinking Cases, Excel Templates, and Analytics in Action problems, all within the chapter context. These applications help students develop an accounting decision-making mindset and improve the professional judgement and communication skills needed to be successful in the profession. With Intermediate Accounting, 18th Edition, you will be able to spark efficient and effective learning, help create the bridge to student success, and inspire and prepare students to be the accounting professionals of tomorrow",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, the sustainable built environment planning in most cities has come to a turning point as the growth in traffic and population has become a serious concern and put tremendous pressure on both the environment and people in these cities. It is therefore important to find new ways or lifestyles\u2014such as compact city, transit-oriented development (TOD) formulations\u2014that are more flexible, inclusive, and sustainable. Furthermore, for the sustainable built environment and urban growth management, not only should the growth management principles\u2014which include smart growth, sustainable growth, and inclusive growth\u2014be taken into account but innovative/smart planning strategies\u2014such as mixed use design, green transport, and new urbanism\u2014are also utilized in planning sustainable built environments in order to prevent the urban sprawl development that has occurred",

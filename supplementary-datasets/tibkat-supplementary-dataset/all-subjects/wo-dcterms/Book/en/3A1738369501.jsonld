            "title": "A practical course in advanced structural design",
            "abstract": "\"This book is written from the perspective of a practicing engineer with over 35 years of experience now working in the academic world to pass on lessons learned over the course of a structural engineering career. It covers the essential topics that will enable beginning structural engineers to gain an advanced understanding prior to entering the workforce, as well as those topics which may receive little, or no, attention in a typical undergraduate curriculum. For example, many new structural engineers are faced with issues regarding estimating collapse loadings during earthquakes and establishing fatigue requirements for cyclic loading- but are typically not taught the underlying methodologies for a full understanding. Features: Combines advanced practice-oriented guidance on structural building and bridge design in a single volume. Presents a detailed treatment of earthquake ground motion from multiple specifications (ASCE 7-16, ASCE 4-16, ASCE 43-05, AASHTO). Includes calculation details for the advanced student as well as the practicing structural engineer. Provides practical example problems and numerous photographs from the author's projects throughout. A Practical Course in Advanced Structural Design will serve as a useful text for graduate and upper-level undergraduate civil engineering students as well as practicing structural engineers\"--",

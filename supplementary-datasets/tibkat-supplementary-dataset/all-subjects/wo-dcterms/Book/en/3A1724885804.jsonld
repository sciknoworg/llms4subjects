            "abstract": "This report presents an assessment of school feedingpolicies and institutions that affect young children in SriLanka. The analysis is based on a World Bank tooldeveloped as part of the Systems Approach for BetterEducation Results (SABER) initiative that aims tosystematically assess education systems against evidence-based global standards and good practice to help countries reform their education systems for proper learning for all. School feeding policies are a critical component of an effective education system, given that children's health and nutrition impact their school attendance, ability to learn, and overall development. A school feeding program is a specific school-based health service, which can be part of a country's broader school health program, and often a large amount of resources is invested in a school feeding program. SABER-School Feeding collects, analyzes, and disseminates comprehensive information on school feeding policies around the world. The overall objective of the initiativeis to help countries design effective policies to improve their education systems, facilitate comparative policy analysis, identify key areas to focus investment, and assist in disseminating good practice. World Food Programme (WFP) decided to use SABER-School Feeding as one of their policy tools to guide the policy dialogue and to assess ina more systematic way the transition of school feedingprograms to national ownership and/or thestrengthening of national school feeding programs. WFP will integrate this tool into their project preparation from 2015 onwards.Five core policy goals form the basis of an effective school feeding program.The first goal is a national policy framework.The second policy goal for school feeding is financial capacity.The third policy goal is institutional capacity and coordination.The fourth policy goal is sound design and implementation.The last policy goal is community roles reaching beyondschools",

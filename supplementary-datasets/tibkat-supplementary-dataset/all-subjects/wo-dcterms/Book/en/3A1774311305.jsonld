            "abstract": "This Country Forest Note (CFN) provides an upstream analysis of the status of forests and of investments and policies relevant to the forest sector in Vietnam. It looks at forests in a programmatic and cross-sectoral manner to strategically position the World Bank Group (WBG) to support the country in delivering on forest smart interventions. More specifically, it outlines current trends and challenges in the forest and land use sectors; builds on the ongoing dialogue and reviews past investments; identifies major challenges and investment and policy gaps; and makes recommendations on key policy changes and sectoral investments needed. The forest sector contributes significantly to the country's economy. The export of wood and timber products amounted to USD 8 billion in 2017, nearly 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Vietnam is also one of the world's leading countries in operationalizing a payment for forest environmental services (PFES) system. In addition, the forest provides a myriad of goods and services that support local livelihoods and the economy as a whole. Given the topography of the country, forests play a particularly critical role in watershed and coastal protection. Despite great economic progress and decreasing deforestation rates, the forest sector faces challenges from competing land uses, overexploitation of resources, mounting risks of supply shortages, and insufficient capacity for forest governance and management. As a result, deforestation and forest degradation rates continue in parts of the country, such as the Central Highlands, and the overall quality of the natural forest continues its downward trend. While two-thirds of Vietnam's natural forests are deemed in poor condition or regenerating, rich and closed-canopy forest constitutes only five percent of the total. There is also the growing threat from climate change, in particular to the country's mangroves. This report presents some of the major trends and challenges facing forests in Vietnam and highlights recommendations to meet its forest-related national targets, sustain its economic growth, and alleviate poverty. The CFN highlights key areas where Vietnam could benefit from further support from the WBG and other partners, based on their comparative advantages and ongoing partnership",

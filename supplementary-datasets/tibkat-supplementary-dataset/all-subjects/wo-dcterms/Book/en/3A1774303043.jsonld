            "abstract": "The City of Yokohama offers useful lessons for other cities seeking to achieve sustainable urban development. It simultaneously managed rapid economic growth and a sharp rise in population through a series of thoughtfully conceived and well\" integrated development projects and regulative measures, each designed to be implemented over the long term and actively involving participation of citizens and the private sector. As a result, Yokohama transformed itself from a deteriorating suburban residential town on the outskirts of Tokyo into an eco-friendly, livable city with a strong economic base. Beginning in the 1960s, Yokohama's urban development moved organically from strategy to coordinated multi-sector action. This was in contrast to the approach of other cities, which more often relied on construction plans and projects developed by individual sectors and departments. A key factor in this approach was the role of the Planning and Coordination Department (PCD), which combined sector-based plans under a single vision and strategy. Despite the significance of PCD's role, its story has not been fully documented and is not known outside Japan. This research aims to address that gap. More broadly, it aims to understand the extent to which political will and the vision of key individuals contributed to the city's development; to identify approaches and lessons that can be replicated in other cities",

            "abstract": "This case study details the critical success factors of the ecosystem supporting the end-to-end delivery of G2P payments in Turkiye (herein referred to as G2P ecosystem), focusing on social assistance payments. These include the following: 1. The Integrated Social Assistance System (ISAS), which forms the backbone of social assistance delivery and represents an international best practice. ISAS processes applications and payments for at least fifty of Turkiye's social protection programs. ISAS is a single system that integrates the social registry (supporting processes of intake, registration, and assessment of needs and conditions), the beneficiary registries for numerous programs, and an integrated system for payments and beneficiary monitoring. 2 The Identification (ID) system, which assigns unique 11-digit prime ID numbers to every citizen and resident. This number is used to facilitate cross-referencing information across relevant databases. 3 The National Address System, which links each ID number to a unique address. Any changes recorded in the National Address System are automatically reflected in the ID system and in ISAS, this system drives efficiency by providing dynamic updates to individual and household profiles that impact eligibility for any given social assistance program. 4 Social Assistance and Solidarity Foundations (SASFs), which provide localized decision-making on each recipient's eligibility. SASFs are responsible for intake and registration, assessments of needs, eligibility, and grievance redressal for social assistance across programs, in addition to universal health coverage. 5 The Treasury Single Account (TSA), which covers all public resources and facilitates electronic fund transfers (EFTs) from the Central Bank to the banking system, which in turn sends the allocated funds to recipients. From PTT or any other commercial bank where the program has an account, payments are made either directly into the recipient's bank account; to a prepaid card associated with that recipient's ID number, for withdrawal from an ATM with an ID number only (cardless pickup); or delivered at home by program staff for certain social assistance programs. 6 National infrastructure, including widespread connectivity, mobile phone access, and physical access points for cash withdrawals, all of which help to ensure that recipients can conveniently access and use funds. 7 A legal and regulatory framework that supports the data privacy and protection of social assistance recipients. These different factors, established by the government through decades of investment in modernization, allow for the seam-less flow of information integral to program delivery. Thanks to this investment, Turkiye was well placed to rapidly expand social assistance in response to the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic",

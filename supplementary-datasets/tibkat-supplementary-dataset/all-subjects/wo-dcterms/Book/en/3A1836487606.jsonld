            "abstract": "\"How were the Ni\u2018matull\u0101h\u012b masters successful in reviving Ni\u2018matull\u0101h\u012b Sufism in Shi\u2018ite Persia? This book investigates the revival of Ni\u2018matull\u0101h\u012b Sufi order after the death of the last Indian Ni\u2018matull\u0101h\u012b master, Ri\u1e0d\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h (d. 1214/1799) in the Deccan.  After the fall of Safavids, the revival movement of the Ni\u2018matull\u0101h\u012b order began with the arrival in Persia of the enthusiastic Indian Sufi master, Ma\u2018\u1e63\u016bm \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h, during the last quarter of the eighteenth century. Later, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Persian masters of the Ni\u2018matull\u0101h\u012b Order were able to solidify the order\u2019s place in the mystical and theological milieu of Persia. Ma\u2018\u1e63\u016bm \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h and his disciples soon spread their mystical and ecstatic beliefs all over Persia. They succeeded in converting a large mass of Persians to Sufi teachings, despite the opposition and persecution they faced from Shi\u2018ite clerics, who were politically and socially the most influential class in Persia. The book demonstrates that \u1e24usayn \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h, Majdh\u016bb \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h, and Mast \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101h were able to consolidate the social and theological role of the Ni\u2018matull\u0101h\u012b order by reinterpreting and articulating classical Sufi teachings in the light of Persian Shi\u200e\u2018ite mystical theology. \"",

            "abstract": "Victor J. Vitanza (author of Sexual Violence in Western Thought and Writing) continues to rethink the problem of sexual violence in cinema and how rape is often represented in \u201cchaste\u201d ways, in the form of a Chaste Cinematics. Vitanza continues to discuss Chaste Cinematics as participating in transdisciplinary-rhetorical traditions that establish the very foundations (groundings, points of stasis) for nation states and cultures. In this offering, however, the initial grounding for the discussions is \u201cbase materialism\u201d (George Bataille): divine filth, the sacred and profane. It is this post-philosophical base materialism that destabilizes binaries, fixedness, and brings forth excluded thirds. Vitanza asks: why is it that a repressed third, or a third figure, returns, most strangely as a \u201cproduct\u201d of rape and torture? He works with Jean-Paul Sartre and Page duBois\u2019s suggestion that the \u201cproduct\u201d is a new \u201cspecies.\u201d  Always attempting unorthodox ways of approaching social problems, Vitanza organizes his table of contents as a DVD menu of \u201cExtras\u201d (supplements). This menu includes Alternate Endings and Easter Eggs as well as an Excursus, which invokes readers to take up the political exigency of the DVD-Book. Vitanza\u2019s first \u201cExtra\u201d studies a trio of films that need to be reconsidered, given what they offer as insights into Chaste Cinematics: Amadeus (a mad god), Henry Fool (a foolish god), and Multiple Maniacs (a divine god who is raped and eats excrement). The second examines Helke Sander\u2019s documentary Liberators Take Liberties, which re-thinks the rapes of German women by the Russians and Allies during the Battle of Berlin. The third rethinks Margie Strosser\u2019s video-film Rape Stories that calls for revenge. In the Alternate Endings, Vitanza rethinks the problem of reversibility in G. No\u00e9\u2019s Irr\u00e9versible. In the Easter Eggs, he considers Dominique Laporte\u2019s \u201cthe Irreparable,\u201d as the object of loss and Giorgio Agamben\u2019s \u201cthe Irreparable,\u201d as hope in what is without remedy. The result is not another film-studies book, but a new genre, a new set of rhetorics, for new ways of thinking about cinematics, perhaps postcinematics",

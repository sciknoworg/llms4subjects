            "title": "Toward a National Single-use Plastics Roadmap in Vietnam : Strategic Options for Reducing Priority Single-use Plastics",
            "abstract": "The government of Vietnam has set ambitious targets for reducing marine plastic litter. In its National Action Plan for Management of Marine Plastic Litter by 2030, Vietnam's government committed to cutting marine plastic litter by 50 and 75 percent, respectively, by 2025 and 2030. Reducing plastics pollution requires a three-pillar pathway that aligns with the 2021 ASEAN Regional Action Plan for Combatting Marine Debris in the ASEAN Member States (2021-2025). Pillar 1: Reduce Inputs into the System focuses on upstream measures such as reducing the use of single-use, low-value plastics. Pillar 2: Enhance Collection and Minimize Leakage focuses on improving solid waste management systems and putting extended producer responsibility (EPR) policy reforms in place. Pillar 3: Create Value for Waste Reuse focuses on the development of markets for plastics recycling and reuse. This report specifically focuses on Pillar 1: Reduce Inputs in the System and provides policy options for how to reduce single use plastics (SUPs). However, significant progress on all three pillars is needed to achieve the ambitious commitments in Vietnam's National Action Plan for Management of Marine Plastic Litter by 2030. Policies for Pillars 2 and 3 do not tackle reducing SUP consumption, directly; instead, they focus more on sustainable alternatives and waste management. The objective of this report is to present short-term policy options for Vietnam's government to consider implementing over the next five years (2022-2026) to achieve significant reduction in the use of single-use plastics. This report summarizes a broad range of policies for eliminating SUPs that include restricting the distribution of SUPs, charging fees when SUPs are used, and banning certain SUPs, and it includes a roadmap for how to implement the proposed policies. In order avoid disruptive economic impacts, the roadmap recommends reducing SUPs in phases, which begin with restrictions and fees, and then gradually progress toward total bans",

Mike shares how his often difficult journey from humble beginnings to leading some of the world's top corporations taught him the importance of hope and purpose, tools that proved invaluable throughout his cancer journey. More than the tale of one man's experience with cancer, this important book includes expert advice and vetted resources to help patients best manage their disease, as well as compelling stories from a wide range of cancer patients who have faced seemingly insurmountable odds yet managed to maintain hope and find meaningful purpose",

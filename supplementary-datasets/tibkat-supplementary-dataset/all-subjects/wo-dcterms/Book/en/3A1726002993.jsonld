            "abstract": "\"Locatelli Partners is one of Italy's leading architecture firms, with offices in Milan (in a sixteenth-century frescoed church) and New York. Offering an unprecedented insight into the practice's methodology, this monograph gathers more than twenty years of projects illustrating the firm's mastery of innovative solutions at different scales, from subtle material touches to ambitious architectural propositions. This anthology features thirty-two residential and commercial projects, as well as highlights from the firm's furniture and lighting design. Featured projects include Massimiliano Locatelli's home in Milan's iconic Torre Velasca, a 3D-printed house, and renowned Milan design dealer Nina Yashar's Nilufar Depot, as well as showrooms for Missoni, MSGM, and Miss Sixty. The book will chart the unique remit and bespoke innovations of each project, as well as the firm's consistent commitment to historical heritage and character. Through drawings, photographs, and floor plans, it will illustrate the firm's continuous exploration of space and materials and its balance of tradition, craft, and innovation to create a unique design language. An inspiring resource for architects, designers, and interiors professionals, this book celebrates Locatelli Partners' pioneering design approach and a distinctive alchemy of quality, Italian craft, and contemporary forms.\"--Publisher's website (viewed October 4, 2019)",

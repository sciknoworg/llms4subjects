                "Mathematics research opportunities for undergraduate students have grown significantly in recent years, but accessible research topics for first- and second-year students with minimal experience beyond high school mathematics are still hard to find. To address this need, this volume provides beginning students with specific research projects and the tools required to tackle them. Most of these projects are accessible to students who have not yet taken Calculus, but students who know some Calculus will find plenty to do here as well. Chapters are self-contained, presenting projects students can pursue, along with essential background material and suggestions for further reading. Suggested prerequisites are noted at the beginning of each chapter. Some topics covered include: games on graphs modeling of biological systems mosaics and virtual knots mathematics for sustainable humanity mathematical epidemiology Mathematics Research for the Beginning Student, Volume 1 will appeal to undergraduate students at two- and four-year colleges who are interested in pursuing mathematics research projects. Faculty members interested in serving as advisors to these students will find ideas and guidance as well. This volume will also be of interest to advanced high school students interested in exploring mathematics research for the first time. A separate volume with research projects for students who have already studied calculus is also available."

            "abstract": "This book provides an excellent overview of how melanoma is treated in the clinic. Since oncologists and clinicians across the globe contributed to this book, each area also explores the unique burdens that geographical areas experience from melanoma subtypes and how these are treated in different settings. It also includes several chapters that illustrate novel methods for diagnosing melanoma in the clinic using new technologies, which are likely to significantly improve outcomes. Several chapters cover surgical techniques and other present very rare or challenging clinical cases of melanoma and how these were treated. The book is geared towards informing clinicians and even patients how melanoma arises, what tools are available and which decisions need to be made by patients and their families in order to treat this devastating disease",

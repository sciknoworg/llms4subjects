The book also serves as a useful reference literature in developing sustainable engineering solutions to various social and techno-commercial issues of global significance. This book is organized into two sections: section 1 is focused on fundamentals and principles of AI to lay the groundwork for the second section. Section 2 explores the sustainable engineering solutions development using AI, which addresses challenges in various computing techniques and opportunities in engineering design for sustainable development using IoT/AI and smart cities. Applications include waste minimization, re-manufacturing, reuse and recycling technologies using IoT/AI, Industry 4.0, intelligent and smart grid systems, energy conservation using technology, and robotic process automation (RPA). The book is ideal for the engineers, researchers and students interested in how AI can aid in sustainable development applications. Discusses artificial intelligence for sustainable solutions; Features applications such as waste minimization, re-manufacturing, reuse and recycling, and robotic process automation; Pertinent to researchers, academics, professionals, and students interested in AI solutions for sustainable development.",

            "abstract": "The idea of \u201cparliamentary administration\u201d might appear, at \ufb01rst sight, like an oxymoron: parliaments are the domain of politicians, the elected representatives of the people, whereas administrations are commonly understood as the executive bureaucracies carrying out the tasks of governments. The historical development of parliamentary administrations has taken di\ufb00erent forms in di\ufb00erent countries, making it di\ufb03cult to generalize. The most delicate issue regarding parliamentary administrations concerns the nature of the activity they perform. The comparative analysis of the data contained in the various country-speci\ufb01c chapters demonstrates several commonalities and di\ufb00erences in relation to certain fundamental organizational and functional options of parliamentary administrations. The very \ufb01rst observation in this context concerns the size of parliamentary administrations. A second dimension of framing the distinctive features of parliamentary administrations is the degree of budgetary autonomy. Looking more closely at recent developments, a number of contemporary challenges can be identi\ufb01ed that parliamentary administrations have had to confront in the 21st century",

            "abstract": "This Special Issue addresses the important issue of the energy efficiency of both manufacturing processes and systems. Manufacturing is responsible for one-third of global energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Thus, improving the energy efficiency of production has been the focus of research in recent years. Energy efficiency has begun to be considered as one of the key decision-making attributes for manufacturing. This book includes recent studies on methods for the measurement of energy efficiency, tools and techniques for the analysis and development of improvements with regards to energy consumption, modeling and simulation of energy efficiency, and the integration of green and lean manufacturing. This book presents a breadth of relevant information, material, and knowledge to support research, policy-making, practices, and experience transferability to address the issues of energy efficiency",

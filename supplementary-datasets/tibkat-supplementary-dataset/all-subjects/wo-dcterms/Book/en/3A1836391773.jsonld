            "title": "A Nuclear Refrain : Emotion, Empire, and the Democratic Potential of Protest",
            "abstract": "\"A Nuclear Refrain is a spatial fiction that critiques the  policy of nuclear deterrence, the concept of Mutually Assured  Destruction, and the UK\u2019s decision to replace its Vanguard submarines,  so-called Trident replacement. We challenge that decision via extending  our geographical imaginations into the past, present, and future. Noting  the more usual economic, moral, and strategic objections to Trident and  its replacement, A Nuclear Refrain considers the issues from  less familiar perspectives: the emotional and embodied, empire and the  establishment, and the impact on democratic potentialities. Set against the authors\u2019 ongoing participation in extensive public  protests against the UK\u2019s decision to replace Trident in 2016, A Nuclear Refrain  disrupts familiar academic and policy forms of writing. It is \u201can  uncomfortable hybrid between academia and fiction,\u201d intent on  discomfiting the reader to spur the radical reimagining of a world  profoundly shaped by the threat of nuclear weapons. Inspired by author  and social critic Charles Dickens, this book draws on the form of A Christmas Carol.  Transported by \u201cghosts\u201d of the nuclear past, present and future, a  pro-Trident British policy maker, the Right Honourable Roger C.  Bezeeneos, has his perceptions sorely challenged. But will Roger allow  his feelings to influence his decision-making? Will he recognize the  yearning for empire-lost that mobilizes the British establishment? And  will he admit the limiting of political participation that a commitment  to nuclear deterrence determines? It\u2019s your call, Roger.\"",

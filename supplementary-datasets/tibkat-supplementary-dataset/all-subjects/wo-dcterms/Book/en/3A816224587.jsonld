The challenge now facing the government and people of China is in achieving cooperation with the international community to avert the costs\u2013both economic and environmental\u2013of accelerating energy consumption.China\u2013Linking Markets for Growth gathers together leading scholars on China\u2019s economic success and its effect on the world economy into the next few decades",

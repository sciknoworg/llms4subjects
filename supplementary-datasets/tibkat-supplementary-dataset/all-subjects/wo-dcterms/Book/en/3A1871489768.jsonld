            "abstract": "This book describes the role of magnetism in electrical engineering, starting from the most basic laws of physics, converted into simulation models such that electrical engineering students can learn by example and practice. The author demystifies a topic that many electrical engineers take for granted, providing readers the tools to be able to understand how any magnetic component works. He describes magnetic components like inductors and transformers in simple understandable language. Mathematical equations related to the basic laws of physics are described in detail along with the physical significance of the equations. Every application is supported by a simulation. All simulations are performed using free and open source software based on Python making the material in this book universally accessible. Magnetism for power engineers; Practical components modelled using basic physical laws; Hands-on simulation approach.",

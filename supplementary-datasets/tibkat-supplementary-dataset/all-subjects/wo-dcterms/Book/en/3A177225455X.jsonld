                "In this open access volume, the editors identify the trajecto\u00adries and pat\u00adterns displayed by education systems and investigate the causes of change from a global and historical perspective. The contributors argue that the emergence and de\u00advelopment of educa\u00adtion systems can be traced back to inherent national factors, as well as to the interna\u00adtional diffusion of ideas. The research presented in this volume is a wide-ranging analysis and explana\u00adtion of the dynamics of emergence, diffusion, and change in relation to state educa\u00adtion systems. The chapters offer an empirical investigation into whether the global diffusion of West\u00adern-rational educational content and organizational forms occurs as expected by neoinstitu\u00adtionalist theory, or whether culturally specific developmen\u00adtal paths dominate in different parts of the world. The book will be of interest to students and researchers in various social science disci\u00adplines, including social policy, education, sociology, political science, international relations, organizational the\u00adory, and economics. Kerstin Martens is Professor of International Relations at the Univer\u00adsity of Bremen, Ger\u00admany. Michael Windzio is Professor of Sociology at the University of Bremen, Germany.",

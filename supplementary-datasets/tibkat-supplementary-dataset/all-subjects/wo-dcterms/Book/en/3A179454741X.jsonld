Topics covered in this issue include three main parts: (I) intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), (II) location-based services (LBSs), and (III) sensing techniques and applications. Three papers on ITSs are as follows: (1) \u201cVehicle positioning and speed estimation based on cellular network signals for urban roads,\u201d by Lai and Kuo; (2) \u201cA method for traffic congestion clustering judgment based on grey relational analysis,\u201d by Zhang et al.; and (3) \u201cSmartphone-based pedestrian\u2019s avoidance behavior recognition towards opportunistic road anomaly detection,\u201d by Ishikawa and Fujinami. Three papers on LBSs are as follows: (1) \u201cA high-efficiency method of mobile positioning based on commercial vehicle operation data,\u201d by Chen et al.; (2) \u201cEfficient location privacy-preserving k-anonymity method based on the credible chain,\u201d by Wang et al.; and (3) \u201cProximity-based asynchronous messaging platform for location-based Internet of things service,\u201d by Gon Jo et al. Two papers on sensing techniques and applications are as follows: (1) \u201cDetection of electronic anklet wearers\u2019 groupings throughout telematics monitoring,\u201d by Machado et al.; and (2) \u201cCamera coverage estimation based on multistage grid subdivision,\u201d by Wang et al",

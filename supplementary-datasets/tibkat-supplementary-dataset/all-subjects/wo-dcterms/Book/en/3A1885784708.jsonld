            "abstract": "The present volume offers a detailed analysis of a fifteenth-century court debate on God\u2019s unicity (taw\u1e25\u012bd), involving the Ottoman scholars Moll\u0101 Zeyrek (d. 903/1497-98 [?]) and \u1e2aocaz\u0101de Mu\u1e63li\u1e25udd\u012bn Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 (d. 893/1488), as a chance to highlight the dynamics of knowledge production at the time: in post-classical Islamic scholarship, an essential element of the process was scholars\u2019 adroitness in synthesizing arguments from differing schools of philosophy and theology \u2013 via close readings of past masters. This dialectic unfolded during a period of imperial restructuring, at a time when Sultan Me\u1e25med II (d. 886/1481) realized his cosmopolitan and universalistic ambitions through his persistent patronage of philosophy and science, a case that is illustrated by his glorious palatine library. The setting, audience, and format of the debate, along with the analyses reveal that the production of knowledge in the early modern Islamic world was intricate, vibrant, and dynamic \u2013 not stale or derivative as previously thought. This book attempts at reconstructing the debate through the information found in bio-bibliographical sources, and comments on certain social and cultural aspects of the fifteenth-century Ottoman scholarship. Analyses of lemmata in the plethora of commentaries and glosses reveal that Ottoman scholars could posit numerous and disparate doctrinal positions, each referencing specific texts, through which the scholars gave their own syntheses based on their unique perspectives. This method of scholarly arbitration is called \u2018verification\u2019 (ta\u1e25q\u012bq) and is exemplified here in \u1e2aocaz\u0101de\u2019s defense and recontextualization of Avicennan philosophy in early Ottoman philosophical theology. The court debate at hand concerns Avicenna\u2019s often-contested ontological formulation, which equaled God\u2019s quiddity/essence to His existence and necessity, a view that went against the theological principle of God\u2019s singularity according to a tradition of Muslim theologians. \u1e2aocaz\u0101de\u2019s defense of the philosophers\u2019 proof demonstrated that one of the senses of the ontological term \u2018necessity\u2019 that Avicenna put forth was identical to God\u2019s quiddity/essence, as well as His \u2018pure existence\u2019. Having gained the upper hand in the debate by verifying Avicenna\u2019s thesis, \u1e2aocaz\u0101de\u2019s argumentative efforts proved that not only could the philosophers\u2019 claim be reconciled with post-classical Islamic theology, but this proof also held true on their own terms despite Zeyrek\u2019s (and the theologians\u2019) objections",

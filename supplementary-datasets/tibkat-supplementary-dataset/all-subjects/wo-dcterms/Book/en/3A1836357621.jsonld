            "abstract": "\"Teaching Mathematics is nothing less than a mathematical manifesto. Arising in response to a limited National Curriculum, and engaged with secondary schooling for those aged 11 \u0336 14 (Key Stage 3) in particular, this handbook for teachers will help them broaden and enrich their students\u2019 mathematical education. It avoids specifying how to teach, and focuses instead on the central principles and concepts that need to be borne in mind by all teachers and textbook authors\u2014but which are little appreciated in the UK at present. This study is aimed at anyone who would like to think more deeply about the discipline of \u2018elementary mathematics\u2019, in England and Wales and anywhere else. By analysing and supplementing the current curriculum, Teaching Mathematics provides food for thought for all those involved in school mathematics, whether as aspiring teachers or as experienced professionals. It challenges us all to reflect upon what it is that makes secondary school mathematics educationally, culturally, and socially important.\"",

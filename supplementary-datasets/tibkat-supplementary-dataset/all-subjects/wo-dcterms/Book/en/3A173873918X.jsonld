Comprehensive discussion, extensive references at the end of each chapter, and the list of review articles in the bibliography offer invaluable resources for advanced readings. Researchers from the undergraduate to postgraduate level and beyond in both academic or industry settings studying and working on mass spectrometry and/or proteomics will benefit from this book."

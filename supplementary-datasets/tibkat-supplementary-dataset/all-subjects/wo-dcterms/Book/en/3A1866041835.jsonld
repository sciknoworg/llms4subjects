This new volume addresses this need by presenting valuable research on the components of protected cultivation, including climate control, modeling, automation, and economics. The volume offers comprehensive coverage of the many aspects of protected crop cultivation, including selecting site-specific appropriate protected structures design, construction, and suitability of structures adoption of improved crop cultivation techniques (shifting from conventional to modern soilless cultivation approaches) cropping sequence of vegetable crops irrigation and fertigation automation climate monitoring and management insect-pests and diseases of common occurrence and their management (including biological control under protected cultivation, selection, and optimization of insect-proof screens for greenhouses) modeling greenhouse micro-climate/environment (such as ventilation rate) economic analysis of protected cultivation The important information presented in this volume will be valuable for farming professionals, faculty and students in agricultural science, agricultural researchers and engineers, as well as for those involved in horticulture and floriculture\"--",

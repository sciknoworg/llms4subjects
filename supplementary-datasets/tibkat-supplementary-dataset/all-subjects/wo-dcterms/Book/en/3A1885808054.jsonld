                "This volume explains knitting technology in an easily-comprehensible and user-friendly manner. The manufacturing of a cost-effective quality product requires careful planning and thorough knowledge of the product as well as production technology. To achieve the desired functional properties in fabric, the relationship between the raw materials, process and finished product is very important. Knitting has been and remains an important textile technique due to the properties of knitted fabric such as elasticity, stretchability, and comfort. Despite the prominence of knitwear, there has been limited data regarding mechanics of weft knitted fabric and effect of structures on physical, mechanical and comfort properties. This book is an attempt to fill that gap. The book provides knowledge about fabric manufacturing techniques, weft knitting structure, and methods of evaluating knitted fabrics and their applications in technical textiles. It also discusses different types of yarn and their manufacturing processes. Testing and quality control in industrial practice as well as management of a fabric dyeing house are also covered.",

                "This book is intended to be an exhaustive study on regularity and other properties of continuity for different types of non-additive multimeasures and with respect to different types of topologies. The book is addressed to graduate and postgraduate students, teachers and all researchers in mathematics, but not only. Since the notions and results offered by this book are closely related to various notions of the theory of probability, this book will be useful to a wider category of readers, using multivalued analysis techniques in areas such as control theory and optimization, economic mathematics, game theory, decision theory, etc. Measure and integration theory developed during the early years of the 20th century is one of the most important contributions to modern mathematical analysis, with important applications in many fields. In the last years, many classical problems from measure theory have been treated in the non-additive case and also extended in the set-valued case. The property of regularity is involved in many results of mathematical analysis, due to its applications in probability theory, stochastic processes, optimal control problems, dynamical systems, Markov chains, potential theory etc."

            "abstract": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery has evolved over the last two decades, with advances in anesthesiology, pharmacology, perioperative medicine, and novel monitoring devices contributing significantly to these patients being able to recover and live safely. Patients with chronic pathologies such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congenital or trauma injuries, changes due to excessive weight loss and others, as well as patient-tourists who have traveled enormous distances are now able to receive cosmetic and reconstructive surgeries that in the past were rejected. The authors of this book also discuss various contemporary topics of anesthesia for plastic and reconstructive surgery that are especially interesting and controversial due to the latest developments on this subject",

            "abstract": "Over the past half century several African countries have drawn up new constitutions, many of which have included a commitment to advancing women\u2019s equality. Decades later, has constitutional reform brought gender equality to women in Africa? And what does gender equality mean in the everyday lives of women on the continent? The contributors to this volume provide insights into women\u2019s rights in seven African countries \u2013 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda. Each looks at the causes, context and consequences of the struggle to uphold women\u2019s rights. Their case studies illustrate property-grabbing in Malawi, women\u2019s citizenship in Nigeria, and the rise of hate crimes and sexual violence against black lesbians in South Africa, among other issues. This book also draws attention to some of the overarching themes and recurring patterns across the continent, which include: * the continued oppression of women through the law itself * the challenges of legal pluralism * the persistent problem of access to justice * the gap between legal protections on paper and implementation of these rights in practice * the limitations of strategic litigation and * the need for other forms of collective activism to advance women\u2019s rights. Policy-makers, legal professionals and NGOs involved in human rights, and academics and students in the fields of constitutional law, gender studies, African studies and sociology will find value in this ground-breaking volume",

            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, In an ever-increasing domain of activity, Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins provides an annual compilation of the world's research effort into this important area of biological chemistry. Volume 34 provides a review of literature published during 2001. Comprising a comprehensive review of significant developments at this biology/chemistry interface, each volume opens with an overview of amino acids and their applications. Work on peptides is reviewed over several chapters, ranging from current trends in their synthesis and conformational and structural analysis, to peptidomimetics and the discovery of peptide-related molecules in nature. The application of advanced techniques in structural elucidation is incorporated into all chapters, whilst periodic chapters on metal complexes of amino acids, peptides and beta-lactams extend the scope of coverage. Efficient searching of specialist topics is facilitated by the sub-division of chapters into discrete subject areas, allowing annual trends to be monitored. All researchers in the pharmaceutical and allied industries, and at the biology/chemistry interface in academia will find this an indispensable reference source.  Specialist Periodical Reports provide systematic and detailed review coverage in major areas of chemical research. Compiled by teams of leading authorities in the relevant subject areas, the series creates a unique service for the active research chemist, with regular, in-depth accounts of progress in particular fields of chemistry. Subject coverage within different volumes of a given title is similar and publication is on an annual or biennial basis. NOW AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY - chapters from volumes published 1998 onwards are now available online, fully searchable by key word, on a pay-to-view basis. Contents pages can be viewed free of charge. Visit www.rsc.org/spr for full details",

                "This Open Access book features a school development model (Arizona Initiative for Leadership Development and Research \u2013 AZiLDR) that offers a roadmap for schools to navigate the complexities of continuous school development. Filled with processes that balance evidence-based values with democratic, culturally responsive values, this book offers strategies to mediate the tensions and to address school culture, context and values, leadership capacity, using data as a source of reflection, curricular and pedagogical activity, and strengths-based approaches to meeting the needs of culturally diverse students. You will find: \u00b7 - Active, reflective activities \u00b7 - Case studies illustrating each concept \u00b7 - The research base supporting each concept \u00b7 - Descriptions of processes from other contexts (South Carolina, Germany, Australia, Sweden) \u00b7 - Thoughts about next steps for contextually sensitive and multi-level school development \u00b7 - Suggestions for cross-national dialogue and research within the Zone of Uncertainty Use this ideal source to guide school leadership teams in creating productive schools that continually grow! .",

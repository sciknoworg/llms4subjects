            "abstract": "\"This ground-breaking Handbook explores the key legal, political and policy questions concerning the implementation of Indigenous rights across the world. An exciting mix of expert Indigenous and non-Indigenous contributors analyse the complex dynamics of contestation, engagement, advocacy and refusal between governments and Indigenous peoples, presenting a profound challenge to mainstream policy scholarship. Chapters employ both country-level case studies as well as global analyses, covering key themes such as self-determination, sovereignty, culture, land and territory. They showcase the extensive evidence that policy imposed on Indigenous peoples without their involvement is at best ineffective and at worst harmful. Through examining the ongoing impacts of colonisation, contributors identify future pathways for Indigenous public policy, including truth-telling processes, resurgence movements, and international human rights law. Ultimately, the Handbook highlights the vital importance and extensive policy benefits of treating Indigenous people as rights-bearing members of sovereign and self-determining Indigenous nations. The Handbook of Indigenous Public Policy will be essential reading for students and scholars of Indigenous studies, public policy, international relations, and political science. It will also be invaluable for policy-makers looking to centre Indigenous people and their rights in the policy-making process\"--",

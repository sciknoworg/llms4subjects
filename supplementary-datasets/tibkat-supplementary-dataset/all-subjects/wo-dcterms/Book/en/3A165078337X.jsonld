                "Advances in Management Accounting (AIMA) publishes well-developed articles on a variety of current topics in management accounting that are relevant to researchers in both practice and academe. As one of the premier management accounting research journals, AIMA is well poised to meet the needs of management accounting scholars. Featured in Volume 15 are articles on: low-intensity R&D and capital budgeting decisions in IT firms; investment decision in modular manufacturing systems within a critical thinking framework; reliability and validity of balanced scorecard measures and dimensions; decision outcomes under activity based-costing; presentation and decision commitment interactions; decision control of products developed using target costing; strategic budgeting and information symmetry; a performance management model; CEO compensation and firm performance; specialized journals and management accounting research paradigms; knowledge management systems for knowledge-products organizations; and, trust and commitment as intangible drivers of interorganizational performance. Researchers in both practice and academe, as well as libraries, would be interested in the articles featured in the AIMA. This work addresses many management accounting issues: budgeting and investment decisions, compensation and performance, research paradigms, and more. It includes both theoretical and practical discussions - a valuable reference for both academics and practitioners. This book series is available electronically at website",

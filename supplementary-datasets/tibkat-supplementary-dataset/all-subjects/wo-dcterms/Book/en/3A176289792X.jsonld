            "abstract": "Human factors are the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data, and other methods to design to optimize human well-being and overall system performance. Human factor issues and the impact of technology on society is a topic that is only growing, and it is essential that it is considered as technology becomes more present in our daily lives. This not only impacts society now but is something to be considered for the future. It is also incredibly important for those in the human factors profession to consider the impact of technology for their work and for the users they are helping design for. Therefore, this topic has immense impact and is important to study from a research perspective to advance the understanding of how technology works, how we work, and how we as humans work within the context of the technology we use.Human Factors Issues and the Impact of Technology on Society examines the role of technology on society with a specific focus on human factors issues and how they are associated with and related to technology use in society. A few highlighted topics within this book are digital health technologies, learning technologies, ethics in social technology, ICT use in businesses, and sustainability. These topics are only a few of examples of how this book analyzes technology in all different facets of society, making it ideal for a wide audience including human factors practitioners, technologists, sociologists, policy makers, teachers, technology developers and designers, business professionals, ethicists, researchers, academicians, students, and anyone else seeking more information on how technology is impacting society through the viewpoint of human factors",

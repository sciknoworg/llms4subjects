Generally Fuzzy Technology, Artificial Neural Nets and Evolutionary Computing are considered to be such approaches. The Editors have assembled new contributions in the areas of fuzzy sets, neural sets and machine learning, as well as combinations of them (so called hybrid methods) in the first part of the book. The second part of the book is dedicated to applications in the areas that are considered to be most relevant to Computational Intelligence."

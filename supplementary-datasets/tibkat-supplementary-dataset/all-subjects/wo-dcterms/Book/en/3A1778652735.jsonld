            "abstract": "In Crush, a stunning collection of erotic poems and queer meditations delineating Stockton\u2019 and Gilson\u2019s mutual crushing on each other, but also all of the ways in which, sweetly and also sadly, affection ameliorates the anguishes that, despite our deepest devotions, are never constant, Stockton and Gilson write, In Aranye Fradenburg\u2019s words, Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets describe \u201cthe love you feel for inappropriate objects: for someone thirty years older, thirty years younger. The kind of love that makes a fool, a pervert, a stalker out of you.\u201d Let\u2019s start here, for much of this description applies to Petrarchan conventions as well. Let\u2019s start here, with this affective entrance into the poems and the impossibility of dispossessing the other\u2019s voice in the manufacture of one\u2019s own machine. Let\u2019s start here, with a vision of poems as indexes of crushes rendered inappropriate, unhealthy by some gradation of difference and level of intensity. With the question of what distinguishes a crush from love if both turn you into a different self. Under oak trees and sunlight, in coffee shops and locker rooms, steam rooms and seminar rooms, and in conversation with Milton, Shakespeare, Frank O\u2019Hara, Narcissus, Allen Ginsberg, Jacques Derrida, Aranye Fradenburg, Mary Magdalene, Freud, Oscar Wilde, Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Elton John, and Prince, among other poets, harlots, saints, and scholars, Stockton and Gilson explore the ways in which friendship, desire, falling, swerving, possession, holding, faggoting, falling, longing, poeming, and crushing open the self to queerly utopic, if also difficult, deflections \u2014 other, more improbable modes of being, as Foucault might have said",

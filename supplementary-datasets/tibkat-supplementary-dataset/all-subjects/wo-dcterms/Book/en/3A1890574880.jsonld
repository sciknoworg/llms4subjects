                "This book advances knowledge on loss & damage (L&D) and its interlinkages with climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. The book includes twelve case studies conducted across South and Southeast Asia, covering sectors including agriculture, rural livelihoods, energy, infrastructure and natural resources. These studies provide insights into complex climate-induced L&D, enhancing local, national and regional knowledge and contributing to global agendas. Vositha Wijenayake, attorney-at-law specializing in environmental and public international law, leads SLYCAN Trust. She has 10+ years of experience in climate change and UNFCCC negotiations with a focus on adaptation, resilience building, loss & damage, gender, technology transfer, finance, and just transition. Dr. Linda Stevenson has 20+ years experience at the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN). She oversees 60+ diverse research projects, fosters scientific capacity, facilitates science-policy-practitioner dialogues, and engages with UNFCCC, IPCC and IPBES. Dr. Akio Takemoto is Head of Programme and Administration at the UNU Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability and has held key roles at the Ministry of the Environment, Japan, and the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research. Dr. Amit Ranjan is a Research Fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore. His latest book is Federalism and Inter-State River Water Disputes in India (2024, Routledge: London and New York). Dennis Mombauer, Director at SLYCAN Trust, brings over a decade of research and management experience, primarily in climate change, adaptation, finance, and sustainable development, including just transition, human mobility, and ecosystem conservation. Dr. Nafesa Ismail, Senior Programme Officer at APN, manages research, oversees knowledge dissemination, and empowers early-career professionals through proposal development workshops. She also serves as an expert reviewer in IPCC and IPBES assessments. .",

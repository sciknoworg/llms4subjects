                "This book collects chapters which discuss interdisciplinary solutions to complex problems by using different approaches in order to save money, time and resources. The book presents the results on the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, decision-making problems, emerging problems and practical achievements in the broad knowledge management field. q-ROFS is one of the hot topics for all the researchers, industrialists as well as academicians. This book is of interest to professionals and researchers working in the field of decision making and computational intelligence, as well as postgraduate and undergraduate students studying applications of fuzzy sets. The book helps solve different kinds of the decision-making problems such as medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, construction problems and technology selection under the uncertain fuzzy environment. Containing 19 chapters, the book begins by giving a topology of the q-ROFSs and their applications. It then progresses in a logical fashion, dedicating a chapter to each approach, including the generalized information measures for q-ROFSs, implementation of q-ROFSs to medical diagnosis, inventory model, multi-attribute decision-making and approaches to real-life industrial problems such as green campus transportation, social responsibility evaluation pattern and extensions of the q-ROFSs."

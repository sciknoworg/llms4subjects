            "abstract": "The Microwave heating has not only revolutionized the food industry but also has extended its wings widely towards its multidimensional applications. Thus it has opened new vistas of potential research in science and technology. The book is compiled into Seventeen Chapters highlighting different aspects varying from epistemological discussion to applicability of conceptual constructs. The inclusion of discussion on the avenues in the field of Chemistry, Health & Environment, Medical Sciences and Technology makes it an exquisite work for the aspirant Researchers. As the text book for the beginners, it is designed fundamentally to be a reference monograph to the experts providing a passage for future research. The plethora of literatures are available on Microwave Applications but they seldom direct their readers to concentrate on the key aspects behind the success in microwave applications in different fields. Here is the attempt to fill up the gap with this book",

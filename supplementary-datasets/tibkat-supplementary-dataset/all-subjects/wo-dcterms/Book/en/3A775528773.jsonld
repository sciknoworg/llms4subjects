                "THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART of waterborne polymers, paints, coatings, inks and printing processes is presented in this volume. This is the third volume in the series on waterborne coating and printing technology. It documents several invited papers and the proceedings of the International Symposium on Surface Phenomena and Latexes in Waterborne Coatings and printing Technology sponsored by the Fine Particle Society (FPS). The FPS meeting was held in Las Vegas, Nevada, July 13-17, 1992. The volume deals with various basic and applied aspects of research on waterborne coating!printing technology. Major topics discussed involve waterborne polymers and polymer blends, pigment grinding, millbases, paint formulation, and characterization of coating films. This edition includes sixteen selected papers related to recent developments in waterborne technology. These papers are divided in three broad categories: (1) Waterborne Polymers and pigment Dispersions, (2) Latex Film, Wetting Phenomena and Printing Gloss, (3) Surfactants and Polymers in Aqueous Coating!printing Systems. This volume includes discussions of various waterborne polymers in coating!printing systems. The editors hope that this volume will serve its intended objective of reflecting the current understanding of formulation and process problems related to waterborne coatings, paints and inks. In addition, it will be a valuable reference source for both novices as well as experts in the field of waterborne technology. It will also help the readers to understand underlying surface phenomena and will enhance the reader's potential for solving critical formulation, evaluation and process problems.",

            "title": "Fault Detection, Diagnosis and Prognosis",
            "abstract": "This book presents the main concepts, state of the art, advances, and case studies of fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis. This topic is a critical variable in industry to reach and maintain competitiveness. Therefore, proper management of the corrective, predictive, and preventive politics in any industry is required. This book complements other subdisciplines such as economics, finance, marketing, decision and risk analysis, engineering, etc. The book presents real case studies in multiple disciplines. It considers the main topics using prognostic and subdiscipline techniques. It is essential to link these topics with the areas of finance, scheduling, resources, downtime, etc. to increase productivity, profitability, maintainability, reliability, safety, and availability, and reduce costs and downtime. Advances in mathematics, modeling, computational techniques, dynamic analysis, etc. are employed analytically. Computational techniques, dynamic analysis, probabilistic methods, and mathematical optimization techniques are expertly blended to support the analysis of prognostic problems with defined constraints and requirements. The book is intended for graduate students and professionals in industrial engineering, business administration, industrial organization, operations management, applied microeconomics, and the decisions sciences, either studying maintenance or needing to solve large, specific, and complex maintenance management problems as part of their jobs. The work will also be of interest to researches from academia",

                "\u201cA much-needed, timely analysis of evolving cyber security concerns for liberal democracies. Katagiri puts forward the notion of cyber deterrence as presenting viable strategic options for countering hacking group sponsored by authoritarian states. This erudite and balanced study on the opportunities and challenges associated with cyber deterrence in democratic contexts will make a significant contribution to literature on emerging technologies in International Relations.\u201d - Ingvild Bode, Associate Professor and Principal Investigator of ERC AutoNorms, Center for War Studies, University of Southern Denmark, Denmark \"Katagiri moves us beyond the often too military-focused analyses of cyber operations and defense. The book is a tremendous recovery of the fundamental difficulty that liberal democracies have in cyberspace. How liberal democracies defend their cyber networks from hackers is unrelenting in its concern for the incomplete and often weak tools that democracies have to deter opportunistic states. A must-read for any scholar thinking about states and cyberspace strategies.\" -Dr. Nina Kollars, Associate Professor, Cyber and Innovation Policy Institute, United States Naval War College This book outlines the main technological, legal, and operational options that liberal democratic nations have when confronting challenges in cyberspace. It offers a range of policy ideas they can adopt to make their defense stronger and deter future cyber-attacks. The author explores how liberal societies, especially those in the Western world, have so far confronted a variety of cybersecurity challenges by hackers in nondemocratic regimes like Russia and China. and zooms in on the main challenges that democratic states face in adopting strategies of cyber deterrence, and how those challenges shape their ability to actually deter hackers. Nori Katagiri is an Associate Professor of Political Science and Coordinator (Director) of International Studies at Saint Louis University (SLU). She is also Senior Fellow of the Irregular Warfare Initiative of the Modern War Institute at the United States Military Academy at West Point (2022-2023)."

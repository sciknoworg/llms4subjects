            "abstract": "The world and China\u2019s place in it have been transformed over the past year. The pressures for change have come from the most severe global financial crisis ever. The crisis has accelerated China\u2019s emergence as a great power. But China and its global partners have yet to think or work through the consequences of its new position for the governance of world affairs. China\u2019s New Place in a World in Crisis discusses and provides in-depth analysis of the following questions. How have China\u2019s growth prospects been affected by the global crisis? How will the crisis and China\u2019s response to it impact China\u2019s major domestic issues, such as industrialisation, urbanisation and the reform of the state-owned sector of the economy? How will the crisis and the international community\u2019s response to it affect the rapidly emerging new international order? What will be China\u2019s, and other major developing countries\u2019, new role? Can China and the world find a way of breaking the nexus between economic growth and environmental sustainability \u2014 especially on the issue of climate change?",

                "This thorough volume presents a wide range of existing methods, from the very popular to the more exotic, in the area of plant genotyping. Many methods of plant genotyping were initially developed for medical research, but all genotyping methods, if they are to be successful, should be suitable for application across the full range of studies within plant biology, as seen in this collection. Plant genotyping methods herein are based on a variety of assessments, including DNA microarray, with its hundreds of thousands of simultaneous reactions, or separate individual studies of DNA sequencing and fragment analysis, PCR and qPCR, allele-specific molecular probes and primers, digestion with restriction endonucleases, microscopy and many others. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step and readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and practical, Plant Genotyping: Methods and Protocols offers researchers the opportunity to update their knowledge and choose the most suitable method of plant genotyping for their chosen application.",

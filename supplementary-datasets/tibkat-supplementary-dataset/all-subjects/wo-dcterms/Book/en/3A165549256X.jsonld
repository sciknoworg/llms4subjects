                "This volume is the proceedings of the Workshop on Optimal Design and Control that was held in Blacksburg, Virginia, April 8-9, 1994. The workshop was spon\u00ad sored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research through the Air Force Center for Optimal Design and Control (CODAC) at Virginia Tech. The workshop was a gathering of engineers and mathematicians actively in\u00ad volved in innovative research in control and optimization, with emphasis placed on problems governed by partial differential equations. The interdisciplinary nature of the workshop and the wide range of subdisciplines represented by the partici\u00ad pants enabled an exchange of valuable information and also led to significant dis\u00ad cussions about multidisciplinary optimization issues. One of the goals of the work\u00ad shop was to include laboratory, industrial, and academic researchers so that anal\u00ad yses, algorithms, implementations, and applications could all be well-represented in the talks; this interdisciplinary nature is reflected in these proceedings. An overriding impression that can be gleaned from the papers in this volume is the complexity of problems addressed by not only those authors engaged in appli\u00ad cations, but also by those engaged in algorithmic development and even mathemat\u00ad ical analyses. Thus, in many instances, systematic approaches using fully nonlin\u00ad ear constraint equations are routinely used to solve control and optimization prob\u00ad lems, in some cases replacing ad-hoc or empirically based procedures."

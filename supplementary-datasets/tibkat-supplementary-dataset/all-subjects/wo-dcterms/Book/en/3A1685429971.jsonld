            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Introducing the principles, practice and applications of mass spectrometric techniques in the study of natural substances in foods, this book conveys the depth and breadth of modern mass spectrometry in relation to food analysis. It covers traditional techniques such as electron and chemical ionisation and newer soft ionisation techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation and electrospray. All of these techniques are especially relevant in food quality and safety studies and in biopolymer analysis. The ability to analyse biopolymers by mass spectrometry is having a major impact on the study of food structure components, food proteins, food pathogens and food components produced from genetically modified organisms. The principles and practice of mass spectrometry are covered in the early chapters and are followed by applications in flavour analysis and the determination of non-nutrient, biologically-active, natural substances in foods.  The analysis and metabolic studies of amino acids, peptides, proteins, lipids, sugars, carbohydrates and vitamins is also discussed, with separate chapters on mineral and micronutrient metabolism and techniques of pyrolysis mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry of Natural Substances in Food will be a valuable resource for food scientists, food analysts and others working in food research, nutrition and safety",

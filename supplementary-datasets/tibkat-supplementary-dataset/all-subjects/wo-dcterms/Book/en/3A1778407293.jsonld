            "abstract": "\u201cWhether International Law is really law is one of those vexed questions that still linger. Prof. Mwenda\u2019s three-pillar approach to looking at International Law is an exceedingly useful conceptual framework which is, at the same time, emblematic of the malleable nature of the discipline. The analysis demonstrates when States pay attention to international law, why they feel compelled to do so, when they choose not to, and why all that matters. This is an extremely timely and accessible book which should be useful to the legal academy and to practitioners.\u201d  \u2013DR VICTOR B. MOSOTI Chief Counsel for Environmental and International Law, Legal Vice-Presidency, The World Bank \u201cProf. Mwenda\u2019s book, \u2018Contemporary Issues in International Law\u2019, is a must-read masterpiece on international law for practitioners, academics and students of public international law. It is a thought-provoking book that touches on contemporary issues confronting international law at a time when multilateralism\u2026is under serious threat. It touches on issues that need to be discussed and addressed in order to be able to deal with the emerging challenges of rising nationalism among leading nations of the world.\u201d  \u2013BRIAN CHIGAWA, ESQ Director of Legal and Corporate Affairs, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)",

            "abstract": "\"Achieving Equitable Education argues that critical gaps in education data are hampering the achievement of one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals: \"inclusive and equitable quality education...for all\". This book critically explores education data gaps across regions, themes and levels of education, highlighting key relationships and disconnects between national, regional and global data needs. Written by expert researchers and practitioners, this informative book establishes a conceptual framework for assessing missing education data and how such gaps disproportionately affect marginalised groups. It then presents a series of regional perspectives on education data gaps from across the globe including Africa, the Arab states, Asia and Latin America, before examining how progress can be made in improving data governance. Incisive and perceptive, this book deftly interrogates the drivers of missing education data and argues that substantive reform to the global education data system can better contribute to the goal of quality, equitable education for all. Achieving Equitable Education will prove a stimulating resource for students and researchers in comparative education, education policy and international development. Its crucial overview of the education data regime will also benefit education practitioners and policymakers as well as practitioners working with national education data systems\"--",

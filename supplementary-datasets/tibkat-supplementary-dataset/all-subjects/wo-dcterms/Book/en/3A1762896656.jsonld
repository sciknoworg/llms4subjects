            "abstract": "Distance learning and remote learning have been developing options within the eLearning and talent training realms for over two decades, yet distance learning has become a significant reality within the past few months, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has forever impacted the K-12, higher education, and adult training and talent development workforce solutions. Within the rapid shift into remote and distance learning environments, the curricular design and instructional design are understood as necessary. However, there is a need to understand aspects around social learning within eLearning environments. It is important to understand the opportunity of moving towards transformative social learning environmental engagement and experiences within distance and remote learning environments to improve the ability to understand social learning in eLearning environments.eLearning Engagement in a Transformative Social Learning Environment focuses on supporting and enhancing remote and distance learning (eLearning) instructional experiences, discusses the strategic role of social learning within eLearning environments, and enhances levels of engagement, transformative learning, and talent attainment environments. This book provides insights and support towards policies and procedures within instructional and training decision making around social learning needs and support. The chapters will explore social learning opportunities and support, modeling social learning engagement, communities of practice, and instructional processes of eLearning. The intended audience is teachers, curriculum developers, instructional designers, professionals, researchers, practitioners, and students working in the field of teaching, training, and talent development",

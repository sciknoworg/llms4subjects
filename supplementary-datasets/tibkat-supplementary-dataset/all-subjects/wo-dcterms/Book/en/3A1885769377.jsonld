            "abstract": "The building industry is a major consumer of natural resources and a large contributor to environmental degradation, leading to a need to rethink current building practices. Digital fabrication (Dfab) technologies, which transform design and engineering data into physical products, are gaining traction in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. This study aimed to evaluate the implications of digital fabrication in the construction industry, by identifying the current Dfab applications and the hindrances that are limiting its implementation. The research questions addressed were why Dfab is essential in the construction sector, the current state-of-the-art of Dfab in the construction industry, and how Dfab is improving the construction industry. Through a systematic literature review, the findings proposed that Dfab can revolutionize the construction sector, enabling freeform architecture, reducing construction costs, cutting material waste, and increasing worker safety. Nevertheless, further research is needed to overcome obstacles such as high costs and the lack of digital skills in the construction industry",

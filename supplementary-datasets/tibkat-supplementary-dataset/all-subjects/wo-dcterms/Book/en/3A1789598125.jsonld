                "\u2018The ratification and signing of international human rights conventions are one of the landmark achievements of the twentieth century, signalling the global necessity of respecting human dignity by protecting fundamental entitlements. This book significantly advances such debates with its rigorous analysis and defence of jus cogens norms to brilliantly argue that these norms must prevail over state immunity and impunity.\u2019 \u2014Alison MacKenzie, School of Sociology, Education and Social Work, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, UK \u2018I commend to prospective readers Dr Selman \u00d6zdan's considerations of the tension between immunities and impunity within the rarefied air of jus cogens norms within an international human rights law paradigm. Dr \u00d6zdan does well to set out a possible road forward towards an international rule of law which ensures the absolute protection of those fundamental rights of a peremptory character.\u2019 \u2014Jean Allain, Professor of International Law, Monash University, Australia This book focuses on the tension between the protection of human rights recognised as jus cogens (peremptory) norms, on the one hand, and the bestowal of immunity on the state and its representatives, on the other, to ascertain how these immunities can be eroded, if not fully abolished, to maintain full protection of jus cogens human rights under international law. The book argues that immunity should not equate to impunity when violations of jus cogens human rights are committed by States, Heads of State, or diplomatic agents. To make the case, the organic structures of the concepts of sovereignty and fundamental human rights are examined. Then, the human rights-based challenge to immunity is presented with respect to State, Head of State and diplomatic immunity, and the transition from a state-centric system to a human-centric system is explored. Jus cogens norms are at the centre of the impunity versus immunity debate. Selman \u00d6zdan is Assistant Professor in the School of Law at Ondokuz May\u0131s University, Turkey, where he is Head of Department for Public International Law. Previously, he worked at Erciyes University School of Law. He is a member of the Society of Legal Scholars and Case Western Reserve University Law Alumni Association. His most recent book chapter appeared in The Epistemology of Deceit in a Postdigital Era: Dupery by Design (2021).",

            "abstract": "There is very little discussion of socially just approaches to speech-language pathology. Within other fields of clinically-oriented practice, social justice is a topic that has received a great deal of attention within the last few years. Pedagogy for addressing social justice has been developed in other disciplines. The field of communication disorders has failed to move forward and do the same. Discussion of social justice is important given the current sociopolitical climate and landscape that clients carry out in their day-to-day functioning. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) have an opportunity to engage in practices that help address and alleviate some of the injustices that contribute to educational and health disparities experienced by communities of color. They may do this through the development and application of a socially just orientation of culturally competent practice that fosters changes beyond the individual level. Adapting such a framework makes it possible for SLPs to effectively advocate for and foster equity and inclusion for the individuals and broader communities impacted by SLP services.Critical Perspectives on Social Justice in Speech-Language Pathology addresses the socio-political contexts of how the field of speech-language pathology and service delivery can impact policy and debates related to social justice issues. It explores social position factors and the experiences of marginalized communities to explore how speech-language pathologists deliver services, train and prepare students, and carry out research in communities of color. It covers topic areas including disproportionality in special education, disability rights and ableism, achievement and opportunity gaps, health disparities, and LGBTQ+ rights with a focus on voice, communication, and gender-diverse populations. This book is essential for speech-language pathologists, administrators, practitioners, researchers, academicians, and students interested in how the SLP profession and discipline can contribute to or develop efforts to help address injustices faced by Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities",

                "This Field Guide offers a rich variety of academic approaches to facilitate leadership development in adults. It is an invaluable resource, giving insightful worked examples linked to theory and reflective commentary. The extensive experiences of world leading exponents of leadership development are distilled into practical application for immediate use. The Editors have selected a diverse range of approaches to leadership development which demonstrate the broad platform of techniques and methods that enable leadership in individuals and organisations to flourish. This Field Guide is embedded in theoretical and academic ideas but still provides accessible and comprehensive knowledge to development teams. Key points at the end of each chapter help the reader to adopt or translate the approaches for their own organisation and industrial context. This Field Guide will be an invaluable resource for human resource specialists, learning facilitators and trainers, and faculty heads. It will also appeal to leadership academics and postgraduate students, such as Masters students in business and psychology, and those focusing on careers in human resources and education"

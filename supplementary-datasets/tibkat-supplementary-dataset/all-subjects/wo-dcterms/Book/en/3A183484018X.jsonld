            "abstract": "\"This book has several objectives. First of all, we lay the groundwork by offering a brief review of the optical switching and networking and the significant successes of recent decades, highlighting key enabling technologies and techniques that have paved the way for modern optical switching networks. We will next explore the broad overview of the future of optical switching and identify important milestones in the development of optical switches of the next generation. In the first section, a detailed introduction opens the way for the reader to learn the history and principles of the topic. The second section focuses on the Switching Devices, the concepts and theories of several optical switching technologies, characteristics and applications areas. The third section explores the optical switching applications in communication networks. Today, optical switching covers a range of technologies and numerous scientific and engineering fields. It is not simple for one to master on several areas in this subject like many modern domains of study. Thus, an edited book of its kind, with several writers, will serve the reader better insight of the subject. We appreciate profoundly the effort, passion and quality of the work of the chapter authors. We are very thankful to many of them, who have not only given their chapters but are also gracious enough to provide important advice and recommendations on preparation of this book. Finally to say, this book is intended to offer readers with an in-depth overview and an in-depth grasp of state-of-the-art optical switching as well as recent and substantial advances in the field of optical switching and networks. It also will be a support for researchers, engineers and experts in developing applications and services in this field\"--",

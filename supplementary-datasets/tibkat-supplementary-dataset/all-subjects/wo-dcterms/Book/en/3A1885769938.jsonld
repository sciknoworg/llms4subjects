However, schizophrenia remains a leading cause of disability and premature mortality. The utilization of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions in the healthcare system, which have the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for people with schizophrenia, heavily depends on medical professionals completing accurate and comprehensive assessments of patients\u2019 psychopathologies, cognitive profiles, physical health statuses and any environmental factors that may influence them. This Special Issue reprint on schizophrenia, from the Journal of Clinical Medicine, presents a collection of articles on current approaches to assessment and treatment, as well as new findings and future perspectives of schizophrenia research and care",

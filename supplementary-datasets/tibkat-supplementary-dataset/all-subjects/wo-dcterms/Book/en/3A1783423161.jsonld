            "abstract": "\"This book provides a review of innovative and novel biotechnological techniques that can be implemented to assess, analyze, and mitigate harmful pollutants and wastes that result from agricultural and industrial operations. It helps to meet the much-needed demand for improvement of low-cost technologies that tackle pollution problems scientifically for the safeguard of the environment, focusing on bioremediation solutions that also create useful and renewable forms of energy. The biotechnological interventions discussed in the volume include approaches involving genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and fluxomics. In addition, biological agents such as microalgae, bacteria, fungi, and bacteriophage, which can also prove to be helpful in the elimination of wastes, are explored. Topics in Environmental Biotechnology: Sustainable Remediation of Contamination in Different Environs include the associated consequences and hazards from agricultural and industrial waste and a variety of bioremediation measures, including the use of bioaugmentation, biosensors, challenges of biofuel production, and more. The book is directed to researchers, scientists, industrialists, farmers, agricultural waste management authorities, as well as to faculty and students, and aims to help implement these novel technologies for environmental stability\"--",

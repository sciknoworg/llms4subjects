            "abstract": "\"Are you ready for a society driven by hydrogen energy? The fact is, no matter if you are ready or not, a hydrogen energy-based society has arrived. Hydrogen as an energy carrier is clean, cheap, inexhaustible, carbon-free, and high in energy and power density, which is perfectly beneficial for mankind to achieve the long-sought goal of a sustainable world. However, hydrogen exists as a gas at normal temperature and pressure conditions, and its energy density is quite low in a normal gaseous state. Thus, the storing of hydrogen becomes critical and actually, a convenient, high-density and low-cost hydrogen storage system is the key to enabling technology for the wide realization of a hydrogen energy-based society. However, finding this proper solution is challenging since many factors should be considered, such as high capacity, good cycle ability, fast kinetics and proper thermodynamics. In this exciting book on hydrogen storage, the worldwide active scientists endeavor to share with you: \u2022 How they adopt new ideas on the synthesis, measurement and characterization techniques to advance the research on current studied materials; \u2022 How they explore new materials for cutting-edge hydrogen storage development; \u2022 How they think up new approaches for the next-generation design and development of future hydrogen storage systems, and; \u2022 How they see the possible future directions of hydrogen storage technology and a hydrogen energy-based society.\"--",

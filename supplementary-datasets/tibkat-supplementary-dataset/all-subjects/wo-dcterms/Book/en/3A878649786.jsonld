            "abstract": "\"Everything you wanted to know about Moto Guzzi! The oldest European motorcycle manufacturer in continuous production, Italy's Moto Guzzi has built some of the most iconic motorcycles ever produced. Established in 1921, the company is one of the most traditional motorcycle makers and also one of the most innovative. Today Moto Guzzi has a higher profile than ever, thanks to its popularity among celebrities like Ewan McGregor. Moto Guzzi was formed by Carlo Guzzi, Giovanni Ravelli, and Giorgio Parodi after WW I. Carlo Guzzi's first engine design, a horizontal single, defined Moto Guzzi's road-going motorcycles for the company's first 45 years. In the 1950s, Moto Guzzi experienced tremendous success in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. Moto Guzzi has experienced low points as well as high points. In February 1967, a state controlled receiver took ownership of Moto Guzzi. It was while in receivership that Guzzi developed the 90-degree V twin engine that came to define Moto Guzzi. De Tomaso Industries Inc. purchased Moto Guzzi in 1973. In 2000 Aprilia S.p.A acquired Moto Guzzi. In 2004, Piaggio & C. S.p.A acquired Aprilia. With the financial backing of a large corporation like Piaggio, Moto Guzzi was once again on firm financial footing, and sales have been on the rise. For the first time ever, The Complete Book of Moto Guzzi: Every Model Since 1921 collects all of these iconic motorcycle in encyclopedia form, written by widely respected Moto Guzzi expert Ian Falloon\"--",

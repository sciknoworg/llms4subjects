            "abstract": "\"The second edition of the book \"Metal Ions in Biochemistry\" deals exhaustively with the role of metal and non-metal ions in biochemical reactions, and also the effect of deficiency of metal ions, toxic effects of metal ions and use of metal complexes in therapeutics. As the nature of binding of the metal ions with the biochemicals and further progress of biochemical reactions, depends on the basic concepts of thermodynamics and kinetics of the metal ligand binding, the first two chapters have been devoted to understanding the structure of biochemicals and their metal coordinating sites, and the factors affecting the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the complexes. Role of mixed ligand complexes and macrocyclic ligand complexes in biochemicals, has also been emphasized. The new aspects in the book are the additional information about role of alkali metal ions in brain chemistry in chapter 3, and various roles of zinc proteins, zinc fingers, zinc signals, in insulin activity and cascade effect in fourth chapter, in the fifth chapter on iron, the addition is of the details of synthesis and break down of haemoglobin. In the seventh chapter the role of vitamin B12 in the synthesis of RBC has been discussed in detail. Chapter 10 of the book presents the role of vanadium and chromium as antidiabetic materials in detail, and also the presence of lanthanides in biochemical systems and their relevance. The last chapter 13 has a novelty that it deals in detail with the role of non metal anions in biochemical systems. The special feature of the book is its simplified and lucid approach, which makes it easy for the students to understand the complex interdisciplinary subject of Bioinorganic chemistry\"--",

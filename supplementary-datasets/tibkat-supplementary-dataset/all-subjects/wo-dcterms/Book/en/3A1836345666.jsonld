Studying two surviving medieval monuments in southern Rajasthan\u2014the Ambik\u0101 Temple in Jagat and the \u015ari \u00c9kli\u1e45gj\u012b Temple Complex in Kail\u0101shpur\u012b\u2014the author looks beyond their divergent sectarian affiliations and patronage structures to underscore many aspects of common practice. This book offers new and extremely valuable insights into these important monuments, illuminating the entangled politics of antiquity and revealing whether a monument\u2019s ritual record is affirmed as continuous and hence hoary or dismissed as discontinuous or reinvented through various strategies.

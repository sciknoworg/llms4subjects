Policy recommendations and authorities\u2019 views: \u2022 Contain rising central government debt through timely fiscal consolidation. The authorities need to implement comprehensive policies to curb the central government deficit and reduce debt to comfortable levels. \u2022 Enhance external stability and bolster growth potential. To improve the external position and rebuild eroding reserves, the authorities should rigorously implement fiscal consolidation and intensify efforts to diversify tourism and exports. Identified structural impediments to growth should be removed expeditiously, with the authorities\u2019 comprehensive growth strategy finalized by the announced deadline of late 2014. \u2022 Further strengthen financial supervision. Close monitoring of credit risks is required in view of persistently elevated non-performing loans (NPLs); and financial crisis prevention and resolution frameworks should be promptly strengthened. \u2022 The authorities broadly concurred with staff\u2019s assessment and recommendations. They especially recognized the urgent need for budget consolidation and expressed commitment to timely implementation of underpinning reforms, as well as to the finalization of a comprehensive economic diversification and growth strategy.

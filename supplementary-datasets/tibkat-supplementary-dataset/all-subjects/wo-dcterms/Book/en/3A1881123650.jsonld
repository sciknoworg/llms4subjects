                "This book explores the theoretical background and provides an experimental analysis of using natural energy resources in sustainable building design. It brings together an international group of contributors focusing on ways natural energy, lighting, and ventilation can improve the performance of electrical, lighting, and mechanical systems. Contributions explore how natural resources can contribute to sustainable development goals while meeting energy demands and maintaining acceptable interior air quality and natural illumination needs. Coverage includes green building design, renewable energy integration, photovoltaic systems, small-scale wind turbines, natural lighting, and natural ventilation. Natural Energy, Lighting, and Ventilation in Sustainable Buildings offers practical and promising solutions for novel challenges in sustainable design for electrical engineers, energy engineers, architectural engineers, and related professionals, as well as researchers and developers from engineering science. Provides essential research on issues and challenges in green building design. Explores the integration of natural energy resources and emerging technologies. Includes a cost-saving analysis on the deployment of natural resources."

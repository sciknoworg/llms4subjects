            "abstract": "Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).The importance of coherent chemistry, that is, the chemistry of periodic oscillatory processes, is increasing at a rapid rate in specific chemical disciplines. While being perfectly understood and highly developed in the fields of physical chemistry, chemical physics and biological chemistry, the periodic developmental paradigm of processes and phenomena still remains poorly developed and misunderstood in classical inorganic chemistry and related branches, such as colloid chemistry. The probability is that we miss subtle colloid chemical phenomena that could be of utmost importance if taken into consideration when catalysis or adsorption is involved. The author here reveals all of the astonishing vistas that periodic wave paradigms open up to researchers in certain colloid chemical systems, and will doubtless stimulate researchers to look at them in a new light. Coherent chemistry, the chemistry of periodical oscillatory processes, is well established in physical chemistry, chemical physics, and biological chemistry, says Sucharev (Chelyabinsk State U., Russia), but not in traditional non-organic chemistry and related branches, such as colloid chemistry. He suspects that much important phenomena is being overlooked during catalysis or adsorption for that reason. He reports on research his laboratory has carried out on oxyhydrate gel systems of rare-earth elements and some related material. They discovered quite early that the properties of oxyhydrates are barely reproducible, or even irreproducible, a problem they are still working on. Meanwhile, he presents some results in process that other scientists can use as starting point. The topics include zirconium oxyhydrate gels with specifically repeated pulsation macromolecules' organizations, Liesegang operator as a consequence of the ionic molecular motion inside the Lenard-Jones potential, organizational mechanism in colloid chemistry stochastic systems, and the lag in how an external magnetic activation affects oxyhydrate gels.",

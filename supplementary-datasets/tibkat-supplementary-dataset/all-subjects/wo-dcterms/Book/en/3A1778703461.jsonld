            "abstract": "The book focuses upon clinical as well as engineering aspects of modern cardiac pacemakers. Modern pacemaker functions, implant techniques, various complications related to implant and complications during follow-up are covered. The issue of interaction between magnetic resonance imaging and pacemakers are well discussed. Chapters are also included discussing the role of pacemakers in congenital and acquired conduction disease. Apart from pacing for bradycardia, the role of pacemakers in cardiac resynchronization therapy has been an important aspect of management of advanced heart failure. The book provides an excellent overview of implantation techniques as well as benefits and limitations of cardiac resynchronization therapy. Pacemaker follow-up with remote monitoring is getting more and more acceptance in clinical practice; therefore, chapters related to various aspects of remote monitoring are also incorporated in the book. The current aspect of cardiac pacemaker physiology and role of cardiac ion channels, as well as the present and future of biopacemakers are included to glimpse into the future management of conductions system diseases. We have also included chapters regarding gut pacemakers as well as pacemaker mechanisms of neural networks. Therefore, the book covers the entire spectrum of modern pacemaker therapy including implant techniques, device related complications, interactions, limitations, and benefits (including the role of pacing role in heart failure), as well as future prospects of cardiac pacing",

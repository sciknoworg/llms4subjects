                "This book highlights issues related to the organization and improvement of the efficiency of training system in technical operation of radio-electronic equipment currently used in civil aviation. The increasing intensity of air traffic around the world leads to a quantitative increase in old problems and the emergence of qualitatively new ones that can only be solved by trained people, whose training process should be carried out on a systematic basis. Modern approaches to improving the human resources potential of civil aviation, as a rule, are based only on modernizing the management mechanisms of the training system. One of the main advantages of this book is the unique integrated approach to building a system for training aviation personnel in the field of technical operation of radio-electronic equipment and air traffic control, which consists in taking into account various factors that affect the training of specialists, promising areas of development of civil aviation based on the analysis of various guidance documents and the construction of mathematical models that give a qualitative assessment of existing methods and the proposed new methodology. The book contains a large amount of visual illustrative material showing the existing structure of the system of training in the field of civil aviation."

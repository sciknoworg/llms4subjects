                "This book critically analyses important social issues experienced in Australia, such as economic inequality, precarious work, unequal access to quality education and health care, housing insecurity, colonisation, racism and discrimination, activism and social change. In doing so, it contributes to urgent discussions in key areas of Australian society. At a moment in time where a more progressive, caring, inclusive and optimistic public discourse is required, this book takes up the challenge of thinking constructively and creatively about the possibilities for change. While the book focuses on Australian-specific experiences, connections to international examples are made to ensure this work has relevance to people beyond an Australian context. Patrick O\u2019Keeffe is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Global, Urban and Social Studies at RMIT University. He teaches and writes in multidisciplinary fields including political and rural sociology, critical human geography, and political economy. He is interested in how processes of marketisation, privatisation and financialisation shape and affect the lives of young people in Australia. Further, Patrick\u2019s research has explored ways that critical and inclusive approaches to design can be applied when working with communities who have experienced the marginalising impacts of racism and inequality."

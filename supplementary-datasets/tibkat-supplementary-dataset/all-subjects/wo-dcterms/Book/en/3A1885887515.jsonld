            "abstract": "\"This book explores the work of Dutch Benedictine monk and architect, Hans van der Laan, and provides a guide to applying his theory to contemporary design practice. Chapters present, interrogate and expand on the philosophies of Hans van der Laan, offering important insights on why we make things, and how our artifacts address the complexity of our physical, cognitive and social needs. The book explores connections between architecture and neuroscience such as the effects of the built environment on human behaviour and the various ways in which the human mind perceives and decodes artefacts. Its reflections on measure and proportion, analogy and logic, matter and mystery will enrich current debates about the genesis of human culture, its basic principles and universal patterns, and its culmination in religious ritual. Final chapters provide practical tools on how to implement van der Laan's proportional system of the Plastic Number in architectural design. Providing tools for reconsidering elemental questions on the origin and meaning of architecture, and for reintroducing play and exploration into design studios, this book will be a compelling resource for all architecture students and academics\"--",

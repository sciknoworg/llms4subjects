                "The second edition of this book illuminates the fundamental principle and applications of probability-based multi-objective optimization for material selection in viewpoint of system theory, in which a brand new concept of preferable probability and its assessment as well as other treatments are introduced by authors for the first time. Hybrids of the new approach with experimental design methodologies (response surface methodology, orthogonal experimental design, and uniform experimental design) are all performed; robustness assessment and performance utility with desirable value are included; discretization treatment in the evaluation is presented; fuzzy-based approach and cluster analysis are involved; applications in portfolio investment and shortest path problem are concerned as well. The authors wish this work will cast a brick to attract jade and would make its contributions to relevant fields as a paving stone. It is designed to be used as a textbook for postgraduate and advanced undergraduate students in relevant majors, while also serving as a valuable reference book for scientists and engineers involved in related fields. .",

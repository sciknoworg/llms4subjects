            "abstract": "\"Elgar Research Agendas outline the future of research in a given area. Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Exploring the social, economic and environmental impacts of events on people, places and communities, this timely Research Agenda highlights the links between theory and practice in event impacts research. Top scholars critically assess events, looking at who benefits from hosting them, and focusing on issues surrounding sustainability, the need to define legacies, and the need to extend regeneration efforts to secure economic and socially sustainable futures. The Research Agenda first outlines key theories and concepts in the field, addressing the three impacts recognized in triple bottom line considerations of sustainability. Chapters then move to analyse a range of types and scales of event, including: conventions and business events, sports tourism, cultural and religious events, intangible cultural heritage, and events in rural locations. This forward-looking Research Agenda further analyses event hosting in emerging economy nations, disability access and inclusion, climate change and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Covering a broad range of types, scales and settings of events, this will be a crucial read for event studies and event management scholars. The critical insights to practical impacts of events will also be beneficial for policy-makers and event practitioners\"--",

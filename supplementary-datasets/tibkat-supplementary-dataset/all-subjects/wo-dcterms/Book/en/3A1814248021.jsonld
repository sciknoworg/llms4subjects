                "This book provides a comprehensive overview of the potential use cases and intelligent technologies, UAV layered architectures, research findings, experimental results, and standardization for intelligent UAV communications for public safety networks. This book will cover the conventional non-intelligent and intelligent solutions specifically targeting UAV communications for public safety networks. Moreover, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently attracted researchers and academician attention because its ability improves the propagation environment and enhances communication quality by intelligently reflecting the received signals. Leveraging intelligence into RIS-assisted UAV communications will meet the requirements of the intelligent, green, and sustainable 5G and beyond cellular networks, which makes it a potential candidate to overcome the inherent drawbacks of legacy wireless systems. The topics covered in this book will be of interest to both the professionals and students. 3D UAV placements schemes, trajectory design, interference management schemes, reinforcement learning solutions for more intelligent and trained solutions, joint UAV trajectory and RIS's passive beamforming design, and various other related topics of readers' interest are presented in detail.",

                "A definitive, interdisciplinary reference to using artificial intelligence technology and data-driven methodologies for sustainable design Artificial Intelligence in Performance-Driven Design: Theories, Methods, and Tools explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML), for performance modeling within the built environment. This work develops the theoretical foundations and methodological frameworks for utilizing AI/ML, with an emphasis on multi-scale modeling encompassing energy flows, environmental quality, and human systems. The book examines relevant practices, case studies, and computational tools that harness AIs capabilities in modeling frameworks, enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and integration of physics-based simulation, optimization, and automation processes. Furthermore, it highlights the integration of intelligent systems and digital twins throughout the lifecycle of the built environment, to enhance our understanding and management of these complex environments. This book also: Incorporates emerging technologies into practical ideas to improve performance analysis and sustainable design Presents data-driven methodologies and technologies that integrate into modeling and design platforms Shares valuable insights and tools for developing decarbonization pathways in urban buildings Includes contributions from expert researchers and educators across a range of related fields Artificial Intelligence in Performance-Driven Design is ideal for architects, engineers, planners, and researchers involved in sustainable design and the built environment. Its also of interest to students of architecture, building science and technology, urban design and planning, environmental engineering, and computer science and engineering",
                "\"The recent advances in data-driven approaches and big data initiatives provide enormous opportunities for sustainable design and research in decarbonization and digital transformation of the built environment. The Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Design: Theories, Methods, and Tools book aims to comprehensively review the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML), in enhancing performance-based design and offer advanced insight into different approaches, methods, and tools for bringing the power of AI in simulation platforms and leveraging digital twin throughout the life cycle of the built environment. The contents center on fundamentals of building science, including key performance indicators such as comfort, indoor/outdoor environmental quality, solar and daylight, and energy exploring human-centered and evidence-based design and optimization procedures and integrating intelligent systems for better understanding, designing, and managing our existing and future built environments\"--"

                "Prof. Christian Hopmann is, since 2011, Head of the Institute of Plastics Processing (IKV) in Industry and the Skilled Crafts at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. He studied Mechanical Engineering with a particular focus on Plastics Processing at RWTH Aachen and received his doctoral degree, supervised by Prof. Walter Michaeli, in 2000. In 2005, he started his industrial career at RKW AG Rheinische Kunststoffwerke (today: RKW SE). From January 2010 until April 2011 he was Managing Director of RKW Sweden AB in Helsingborg, Sweden. Prof. Walter Michaeli is former Head of the Institute of Plastics Processing (IKV) at RWTH Aachen University, a position he held with for 23 highly successful years. He studied Manufacturing Engineering at RWTH Aachen, and, after over 8 years of industrial employment, took over as Head of the IKV in 1988. For his development of an innovative water-injection method for injection molding, he received the Otto von Guericke Prize of the German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF) in 2002",
                "This definitive book provides a comprehensive account of the full range of dies used for extrusion of plastics and elastomers. The distinctive features of the various types of dies are described in detail. Expert advice on the configuration of dies is given, and the possibilities of computer-aided design, as well as its limitations, are demonstrated. Fundamentals and computational procedures are clearly explained so that no special prior knowledge of the subject is required. The mechanical configuration, handling, and maintenance of extrusion dies are described. Calibration procedures for pipes and profiles are also discussed. This book was written for plastics engineers who need daily support in their practical work in industry and science, as well as for students preparing for their professional life. The 4th edition is brought up to date with several important additions, including coverage of multilayer (>15 layer) dies, melt encapsulation, and simulation tools (rheological/thermal CFD simulations)"

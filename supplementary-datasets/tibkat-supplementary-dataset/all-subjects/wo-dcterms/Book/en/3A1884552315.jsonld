                "This book offers a comprehensive collection of typical tasks from technical thermodynamics. It is ideal for preparing written and oral examinations at university. It contains 180 tasks that are solved in detail. Alternative solution strategies are often shown and discussed. The book is interesting for all engineering students who have to take an exam in thermodynamics. A problem-orientated approach is followed and a systematic method for solving the tasks is developed. Theoretical correlations and thermodynamic fundamentals are solved by means of concrete tasks. In addition to comprehension questions, the book contains numerous typical calculation problems. Here, too, the basics are summarised and solutions respectively solution strategies are discussed. These are conceived to provide students with strategies and tools to solve complex tasks. All these exercises should help to deepen the physical knowledge. The greater the technical competence, the more confidently one can face the exam! At best, the tasks will help you to have fun and enjoy thermodynamics! This book is a perfect complement to my textbook \"Technical Thermodynamics for Engineers\".",

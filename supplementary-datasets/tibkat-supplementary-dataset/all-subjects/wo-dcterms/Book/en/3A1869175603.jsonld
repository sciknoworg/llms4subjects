            "abstract": "With the advancements in the medical and scientific fields, the global community has acquired a comprehensive understanding about brain insults and pathologies. In addition, new findings and discoveries are being made globally every day, which keep our curiosity high and drive a knowledge gain. Any brain insult or pathology is multifactorial, including a cascade of inflammation, necrotic, and apoptotic pathways; can be influenced by genetic or environmental factors; and may lead to chronic neurodegeneration or disabilities.  This Special Issue, entitled \u201cBrain Injury and Neurodegeneration: Molecular, Functional, and Translational Approach\u201d, has addressed various important aspects of brain injury and neurodegeneration, such as TBI, cerebral hypoxia, epilepsy, AD, and SARS-CoV-2-mediated brain damage. It received appreciable global response, and published 18 peer-reviewed articles, including 10 research articles and 8 reviews. Briefly, it explores the recent coronavirus infection-mediated cerebral damage; discusses the mechanism of TBI, ischemia, hypoxia, and epilepsy; talks about neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and CONDCA; and, finally, reviews the translational values of phytochemicals in brain pathologies. In conclusion, this Special Issue provides a unique review on brain injury and neurodegeneration, and will be a good tool in enhancing knowledge in terms of brain disease-related pathology, mechanisms, and translational approach",

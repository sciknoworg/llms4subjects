            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Experimental Toxicology is an important text for undergraduates, post-graduates and professionals involved with studying or teaching this often controversial subject. It addresses the basic issues concerned with the practice of experimental toxicology and discusses in detail the following topics: experimental design; biochemical issues; animal husbandry; species differences; immunological issues; carcinogenesis; reproductive approaches; statistics; genetics; in vitro and molecular approaches; risk assessment; information resources; aspects of legislation; good laboratory practice; and laboratory design. The book has been updated and revised to reflect the many changes that have taken place since the first edition was published five years ago and this 2nd Edition gives special attention to the extensive changes that have taken place in the areas of molecular, genetic and reproductive toxicology and in the knowledge regarding the multiplicity of enzymes involved in foreign compound metabolism. Experimental Toxicology is a must for newcomers to the field who wish to gain an understanding of what toxicology is all about.  It will also be of interest to experienced practitioners and to professionals from other areas who need a rapid introduction to the subject",

                "There is an increasing interest in emerging markets because of the higher economic growth rates compared to developed economies. However, these markets have a diverse consumer base with unique needs and preferences. As a result, companies in these markets face different challenges and opportunities. Unfortunately, there is a lack of marketing cases from these markets. This book presents actual real-world marketing cases in these markets offering an in-depth look at some of the issues faced by companies in different industries. It is hoped that the cases would serve as valuable reference material for academics, students, professionals in marketing, business strategy, and other related fields as well as policymakers, to better understand the challenges of these markets, and develop strategies to succeed in them.",

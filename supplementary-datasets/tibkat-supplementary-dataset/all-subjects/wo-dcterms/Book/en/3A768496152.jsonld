Industrial Chemical Process Design, Second Edition provides a step-by-step methodology and 25 downloadable, customizable, needs-specific software applications that offer quick, accurate solutions to complex process design problems. These applications uniquely fill the gaps left by large, very expensive commercial process simulation software packages used to select, size, and design industrial chemical process equipment. Written by a hands-on industry consultant and featuring more than 200 illustrations, this book thoroughly details:  Sizing and cost estimating of process unit operation equipment Design and rating of fractionation equipment and three-phase separation equipment Chemical optimization Commercial distillation Packaged plant cost analysis Estimating cost for modular packages Performing operations such as liquid-liquid extraction and gas liquid separation vessel sizing and rating  Green engineering New to the Second Edition:  Added focus on sustainability with new green engineering coverage:  crude oil database; vegetable oils and plant greenhouse production for use in automobile fuels; gasoline and diesel fuel database; greenhouse fuels; water removal treatment in three-phase vessel design New focus on engineering economics Simplified shell/tube design method and improved shell/tube exchanger software improvements Fluid flow coverage includes both single- and two-phase flow and the very desirable addition of complete process engineering of NOx removal and catalytic SCR reactor processes necessary in all electric generator power plants and refinery furnace systems (per mandatory EPA regulations) Coverage of the Fischer-Tropsch process converting natural methane gas to crude oil products, liquids, gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel - all sulfur-free!  Includes a plan to decrease reliance on crude oil imports Contains a packaged cost analysis natural gas-to-liquids plant turn-key software program \"--",

            "abstract": "KEY ISSUES Near-term outlook. Malaysia\u2019s healthy, noninflationary growth continued in 2013, albeit at a somewhat slower clip than earlier years. While domestic demand remained robust, the economy was buffeted by external headwinds, including from volatile capital flows in spring-summer and weak export growth. The current account surplus continued to narrow, although it remains comfortably in surplus. Continued strength in domestic demand, especially investment, and a pickup in external demand should help maintain robust growth going forward despite the welcome fiscal tightening. Macroeconomic policy mix. Staff welcomes the timely, credible, and gradual recalibration of macroeconomic policies, which should help achieve a smooth transition to the post-UMP environment. The budget is being tightened and fiscal institutions strengthened. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), which maintains an accommodative monetary stance for now, possesses ample policy credibility and should be able to contain any second round price effects associated with fuel subsidy reductions.

Malaysia\u2019s financial system is sound, supported by strong supervision and regulation. Targeted, yet escalating macroprudential policies (MAPs) are being employed to deal with the risks from high rates of credit growth and rising household debt. These risks, as well as the effectiveness of MAPs, should continue to be closely monitored. The exchange rate remains flexible and, together with Malaysia\u2019s ample financial buffers and sound monetary and fiscal policies; should safeguard the economy from potentially volatile capital flows. Inclusive growth: the role of human capital. The authorities have designed and are implementing several ambitious transformation programs and blueprints to turn Malaysia into a high-income, knowledge and innovation based nation by 2020. Their efforts are on track, alt ...",

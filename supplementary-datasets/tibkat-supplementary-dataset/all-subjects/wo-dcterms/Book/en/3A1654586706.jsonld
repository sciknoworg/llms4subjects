            "abstract": "This book describes a quarter-century of computing R&D at the Institute for Cognitive Prosthetics, focusing on the needs of individuals with cognitive disabilities from brain injury. Models and methods from Human Computer Interaction (HCI) can illuminate those needs, and have expanded the role of cognitive assistive technology. User interface (UI) design has been shown to be the most important design area for individuals with cognitive disabilities. Conventional UIs typically are inappropriate for these users. Personalizing the user interface is an important strategy in achieving appropriate software for these users. Case studies are used to illustrate personalization for HCI and clinical audiences. Patient-Centered Design (PCD) is a design methodology which incorporates both clinical and technical factors. PCD also takes advantage of the patient's ability to redesign and refine the user interface, and to achieve a very good fit between user and system. PCD can increase an individual's cognitive functioning as a technology effect. Additionally, some individuals have shown an increase in underlying cognitive abilities. Some relevant concepts from cognitive neuroscience are introduced. Cognitive Prosthetics Telerehabilitation is a powerful therapy modality. Essential characteristics are delivering service to patients in their own home, having the patient's priority activities be the focus of therapy, using cognitive prosthetic software which applies Patient Centered Design, and videoconferencing with a workspace shared between therapist and patient. Cognitive Prosthetics Telerehabilitation offers a rich set of advantages for the many stakeholders involved with brain injury rehabilitation",

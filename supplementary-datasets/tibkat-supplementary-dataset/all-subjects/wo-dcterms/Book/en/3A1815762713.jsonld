            "abstract": "These remarks were delivered by World Bank Group President David Malpass at The State of Global Learning Poverty 2022 Update Report Launch on June 28, 2022. He said that the COVID-related school closures and disruptions have deepened the learning crisis and worsened inequalities in education. He highlighted that the World Bank estimates that the share of 10-year-old children in developing countries who are unable to read and understand a basic text is now at 70 percent. He insisted that it's urgent for political leaders to act decisively to recover and accelerate learning and avoid a human capital catastrophe. He suggested that they can do that by prioritizing four learning recovery strategies and investments: First, re-enroll and retain children in school; Second, focus on foundational learning; Third, assess students' learning levels; and Fourth, support teachers with the practical training and learning materials that are proven to help students recover lost learning rapidly. He mentioned that the World Bank is committed to working with partners in support of countries to achieve more equal, effective, and resilient education, particularly for girls. He concluded by saying that it's critical that children and youth of this generation have the opportunity to shape the future they deserve",

                "This book offers a unique look into the world of policing and the frontline of Brazil\u2019s war on drugs. It analyzes the tensions produced by attempts to modernize Rio de Janeiro\u2019s public security policies. Since the return of democracy in 1985, Rio's police forces have waged war against armed drug gangs based in the city\u2019s favelas, casting the people who live in these communities as internal enemies. In preparation for the Olympics in 2016, the police sought to \u2018pacify\u2019 the favelas and their populations through the establishment of Pacifying Police Units (UPPs) in many of the city\u2019s favela communities. Drawing on eight months of ethnographic fieldwork with the police, this book follows officers across the institutional hierarchy in their daily activities, on patrol, and during training. Tracing the genealogies of contemporary forms of policing-as-warfare through the notion of \u2018colonial war\u2019 and \u2018cultural war\u2019, it highlights the material and ideational dimensions of war as a cosmological force that shapes Brazilian social relations, subjectivities, landscapes, economies, and politics. It draws on the Deleuzian notion of \u2018war machine and state dynamics\u2019 to show how practices of elimination co-exist with attempts to transform favela territories and their people and analyzes the link between the moral universe of policing and right-wing populism in Brazil. Through rich and nuanced ethnography, it offers a critical perspective on militarized policing and 21st century forms of authoritarianism. Tomas Salem is a PhD-fellow in Social Anthropology at the University of Bergen in Norway. He carried out fieldwork with the Pacifying Police Units of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Military Police in 2015 and has an interdisciplinary background from the fields of Public Security and Gender Studies. His research interests span from critical perspectives on masculinity to post-colonial theory, right-wing authoritarianism, state formation and state violence. This is his first book. It is based on his award-winning thesis Taming the War-Machine: Police, Pacification, and Power in Rio de Janeiro and ten years of research on Brazilian policing. .",

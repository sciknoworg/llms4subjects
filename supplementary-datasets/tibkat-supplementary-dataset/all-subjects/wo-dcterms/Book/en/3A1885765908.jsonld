            "abstract": "In China between Peace and War, Victor S. C. Cheng explores the                    gripping history of peace talks and international negotiations from 1945 to 1947                    that helped determine the shape of the Chinese Civil War. The book focuses on                    the efforts of the two belligerent parties\u2014\u200bthe Chinese Nationalists, or                    Guomindang, and the Communists\u2014to achieve an enduring peace. It presents                    previously unexplored major elements of the peace talks: ambiguous treaties,                    package deals and short-term solutions. It identifies the burning challenges                    that confronted attempts at peacemaking, including the two warring parties'                    high-risk decision-making styles and the temptation to veto agreements and                    resume fighting. Cheng argues against popular notions that differences between                    the two belligerents in the Chinese Civil War were irreconcilable, that the                    failure of the peace talks was predetermined and that the US government                    mediators needed to remain neutral. Because the actions around the negotiating                    table occurred in a developing theatre of war, Cheng also explores the military                    decision-making of the opposing sides as well as the conflicts that ultimately                    plunged China into the world\u2019s largest military engagement of the seven-plus                    decades since World War II. China between Peace and War highlights the                    contradictory role of political leaders who micromanaged the military, including                    their struggle to connect political objectives and military power, their                    rhetorical use of the 'decisive war\u2019 concept, and their pursuit of radical                    military-political goals at the expense of a negotiated peace",

                "\u201cAn outstanding piece of scholarship. Consistently rigorous, deep and broad. It is the definitive analysis of Australia\u2019s think tanks to date. It thoroughly diagnoses the reasons for their growth, how they work, and dives deep into the toughest questions \u2013 how much do think tanks really change policy outcomes in Australia, and how do they do it?\u201d --John Daley AM, Founding Chief Executive of the Grattan Institute, Australia \u201cThe deepest and most comprehensive scholarly account yet produced on the important and growing role of think tanks in Australia's public policy ecosystem. Trent Hagland's book is essential reading for think tankers, scholars and the policy makers they are hoping to influence.\u201d --Allan Gyngell AO, National President of the Australian Institute of International Affairs, and Founding Executive Director of The Lowy Institute for International Policy, Australia \u201cTrent Hagland has produced the first comprehensive account of policy-oriented think tanks in Australia. Building on the international think-tank literature, he examines the growth and diversification of Australian think tanks. Three original and detailed case studies provide rich new perspectives concerning the activities and achievements of leading think tanks, in their ongoing attempts to influence policymaking.\u201d --Brian Head, Professor, School of Political Science and International Studies, The University of Queensland, Australia This book provides the most comprehensive study of the Australian think-tank industry to date. Drawing on empirical evidence, it first assesses the structure of the industry, the methods think tanks use to persuade policymakers, and public perceptions of their effectiveness. The book then proceeds to examine three unique policy cases to analyse think tank influence on policymaking. It argues that whilst think tanks play important roles in Australia\u2019s policy process, their impacts vary depending on their approach and objectives. The book also demonstrates that policymakers with contrasting ideological orientations diverge in their assessments of the utility and influence of think tanks. It will appeal to students and scholars of public policy, and practitioners in public administration and governance. Trent Hagland is an Adjunct Professor at the University of Sydney Business School, Australia.",

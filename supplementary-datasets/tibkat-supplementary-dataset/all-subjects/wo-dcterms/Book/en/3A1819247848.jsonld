            "abstract": "\"The lack of knowledge of steam system design and operation in the engineering community is becoming more evident each year. Consequently, most organizations tasked with designing or operating a steam system rely heavily on the steam equipment manufactures to help them figure it out. Although there is a lot of good individual equipment guidance available today, if you don't understand the steam system function as a whole, it is very easy to end up with a poorly designed system. The book is written with a system approach and looks at each part of the steam system individually with many examples of how to size and select the right equipment for a variety of applications. In addition to engineering principles, the text discusses good operations, maintenance, troubleshooting and commissioning practices of the entire steam system. This book is meant to provide a text for learning and a reference guide for operators, maintainers and engineers\"--",

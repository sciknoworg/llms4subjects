            "abstract": "\"This practical, yet advanced, book is written from the perspective of an engineer with many years' experience in the design and manufacturing of semiconductor microchips, and describes the process using the principles of physics and chemistry. The author believes that readers need to have a simple and practical book in their toolbox, and many former students have praised his approach as being invaluable to their onward career development. The explanation of the semiconductor manufacturing process, and the equipment needed, is carried out based on the machines that are used in clean rooms the world over, so readers will understand how the equipment works, and how they can use the equipment to achieve their design and manufacturing ambitions. Combining theory with practice, all descriptions are carried out around the actual equipment and processes by way of a highly visual text, with illustrations including equipment pictures, manufacturing process schematics, and structures of semiconductor microchips. Through this book, readers can obtain the fundamental knowledge and skills of semiconductor manufacturing, which will help them to better-understand and use semiconductor technology to improve their product quality or project research.\"--",

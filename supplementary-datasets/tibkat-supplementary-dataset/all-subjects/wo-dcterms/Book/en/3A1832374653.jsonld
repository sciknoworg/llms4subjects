            "title": "Hepatocellular Carcinoma",
            "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, has become a major global health problem and is responsible for a steadily increasing number of cancer-related deaths. Although the risk factors for HCC development are well known and great advances have been made through HBV vaccinations, direct-acting antivirals for HCV treatment, and aflatoxin eradication programs, the overall incidence and mortality rates of HCC are still rising. To tackle the burden of HCC, it is essential to understand the principle molecular and cellular processes as well as fundamental clinical challenges. This book provides an overview on several important disease aspects. Chapter 1 reviews recent studies assessing the potential cellular origins of HCC. Chapter 2 describes the newly discovered regulatory roles of the tumor microenvironment on tumor growth and progression. Chapters 3 and 4 outline the most commonly used in vitro systems and animal models of chronic liver disease and HCC in detail. Chapter 5 provides an overview of metabolic reprogramming and dysregulation of lipid metabolism as a newly recognized hallmark of HCC. Chapter 6 details the currently accepted standards and challenges for the surgical management of HCC, while Chapter 7 provides an overview of the recent developments in the field of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Chapter 8 discusses multidrug resistance to chemotherapy and potential approaches to overcome this clinical obstacle. The book, written by experts from several countries, addresses each topic in sophisticated detail. It will be a valuable resource for clinicians and investigators who are interested in HCC",

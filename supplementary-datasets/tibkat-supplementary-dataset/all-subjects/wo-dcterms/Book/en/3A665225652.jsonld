            "title": "Nipisat - a Saqqaq culture site in Sisimiut, central West Greenland (Vol. 331)",
            "abstract": "From 1989 to 1994, more than 200 m2 were excavated at the Saqqaq site of Nipisat, situatedon a small island 15 km south of Sisimiut. The excellent preservation conditions fororganic material, and the fact that some of the stone artefacts were not previouslyknown from the Saqqaq Culture, were the main reasons for the excavation. More than70,000 bone fragments, 20,000 flakes and 1,000 artefacts were recovered.A total of 33 dates, making this site one of the best dated in the entire Arctic, revealthat Nipisat was occupied continuously for nearly 1,500 years. Although protrudingbedrock disturbed the stratigraphy and several lenses of crushed shells interrupted thelayers, three different chronological phases could be identified. Phase 1 is dated by eight14C dates ranging from 2020 to 1740 BC (cal). Phase 2 partly overlaps, but is mainlyyounger than phase 1 and dated by five 14C dates to 1860-1325 BC (cal). Phase 3 is datedby 16 14C dates to 1310-810 BC (cal). One date was very young (520 BC (cal)) and problematicbecause of extreme oscillations of the 14C curve. From phase 1 there is a mid-passagestructure with a box-hearth. A ring of flagstones surrounds the structure. Fromphase 2 there is a well-defined box-hearth. There was no clear outline of a tent ring surroundingthe hearth, which could be due to later disturbances in phase 3. No dwellingstructures were recognised from phase 3. Instead several sherds of soapstone wererecorded, indicating the use of blubber for light or cooking. From phase 1 and 2 the tooltypes are well known from other Saqqaq sites in Greenland and Arctic Canada e.g. smallharpoon endblades, projectile points, knife blades, scrapers, burins etc. and needles,flint flakers, harpoon heads, wedges etc. But from phase 3 previously unknown typeswere recorded. A new tool kit for sea mammal hunting is seen in the very sturdy harpoonor lance head made of antler. In addition there are many different kinds of barbed leistersor spears. New types of bevelled harpoon heads, bevelled knife blades and bevelledprojectile points, all made of killiaq (silicified slate), were also registered.The faunal assemblage of Nipisat yielded 28,823 identified bone fragments representingat least 42 species of fish, birds and mammals. The fish remains, comprising c. 2%of the faunal material, consisted nearly entirely (98%) of fairly large sized cod (). The bird remains comprise c. 47% of the material and derive from at least 24bird species. Gulls are the dominant group (c. 54% of the bird remains) followed by eiderducks ( spp.) (24%) and  spp. (13%) presumably barnacle geese (), while auks () were found in lower frequencies. The most spectacularfinds, however, were skeletal remains of subadult great auks () fromthe oldest phase. A total of 60 presumed whooper swan () remains constitutethe hitherto largest, northernmost and oldest occurrence in Greenland.At least 14 mammalian species were identified revealing a surprisingly large proportionof caribou () (51% of the mammal remains) for a coastal site. Sealsaccounted for 45%, with the common seal () as the absolutely dominantcomponent. Other marine mammals were walrus () and harbourporpoise (), which played an important but minor role. Polar bear() hunting was documented by the presence of four fragments from theyoungest phase. Saqqaq people were accompanied by fairly large and robust dogs ().Nipisat, the first larger Saqqaq site to be excavated from the Open Water Area was acoastal site and through all occupation phases the game animals of the surroundingwaters and fjords were hunted. For more than a millennium, the site was visited brieflyfrom time to time, at least during spring, summer and early autumn. Staging geese werecaptured during spring. In June and July the breeding birds were exploited for their eggsand easily accessible young, as documented by large numbers of juvenile gull bones inparticular. The common seal hunting specialised on immature individuals caught primarilyduring their first summer on the breeding grounds. The inhabitants at Nipisat alsohunted caribou on the mainland. The age structure and sex distribution of the caribouremains primarily reflect stalking. Selected body parts, especially the fore and hind legsand the heads, were transported to the island for raw material, meat filleting and furtherprocessing for marrow extraction and fat rendering.The exploitation of fauna through the entire occupation period was remarkablyconstant with respect to choice of game animal and the selected age groups. Althougheiders were more abundant in phase 1 (36%) than in phase 3 (17%) while gulls increasedfrom 43 to 61% in the same time period. The same trend was found valid for geese, whichincreased over time while the importance of auks decreased. Harbour porpoise seem tohave decreased while walrus increased in relative importance through time. Caribouseem to be of greater importance in phase 3 with 55% compared to 45% in phase 1. Theslight shift in preferred resources may be explained by fluctuating abundance and availabilityof the game species combined with the development of new hunting tools.Based on the new investigations in the Sisimiut District, the gap between Saqqaqand Dorset Culture in Central West Greenland has been diminished. Although resourceexploitation at the site seems to have been very stable through all three phases, there areaspects of cultural change bridging the transition from Saqqaq to Dorset Cultures. Theintroduction of bevelled tools, sturdy harpoon or lance heads and the abandonment ofthe bow and arrow in phase 3, show cultural affiliation with Dorset technology. This isalso true in terms of lithic raw material preference, the introduction of soapstone artefactsand the absence of dwelling structures with a well-defined box-hearth. At the sametime it looks like, the central occupation area for the Saqqaq Culture shifted southwardsfrom the Qeqertarsuup Tunua area towards Sisimiut and Nuuk",

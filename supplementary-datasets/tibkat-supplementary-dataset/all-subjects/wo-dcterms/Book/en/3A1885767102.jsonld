            "abstract": "On Friday nights many parents want to have a little fun together\u2014without the kids. But \u201cgetting a sitter\u201d\u2014especially a dependable one\u2014rarely seems trouble-free. Will the kids be safe with \u201cthat girl\u201d? It\u2019s a question that discomfited parents have been asking ever since the emergence of the modern American teenage girl nearly a century ago. In Babysitter, Miriam Forman-Brunell brings critical attention to the ubiquitous, yet long-overlooked babysitter in the popular imagination and American history. Informed by her research on the history of teenage girls\u2019 culture, Forman-Brunell analyzes the babysitter, who has embodied adults\u2019 fundamental apprehensions about girls\u2019 pursuit of autonomy and empowerment. In fact, the grievances go both ways, as girls have been distressed by unsatisfactory working conditions. In her quest to gain a fuller picture of this largely unexamined cultural phenomenon, Forman-Brunell analyzes a wealth of diverse sources, such as The Baby-sitter\u2019s Club book series, horror movies like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, urban legends, magazines, newspapers, television shows, pornography, and more. Forman-Brunell shows that beyond the mundane, understandable apprehensions stirred by hiring a caretaker to \u201cmind the children\u201d in one\u2019s own home, babysitters became lightning rods for society\u2019s larger fears about gender and generational change. In the end, experts\u2019 efforts to tame teenage girls with training courses, handbooks, and other texts failed to prevent generations from turning their backs on babysitting",

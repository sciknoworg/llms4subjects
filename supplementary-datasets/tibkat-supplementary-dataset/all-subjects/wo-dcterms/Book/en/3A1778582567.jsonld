            "abstract": "The idea of origin in terms of space and culture as a special indicator of quality is one of the most in\ufb02uential strands in contemporary food. It impacts on politics, economics and everyday life \u2013 and it connects these \ufb01elds with complex relations of power and culture. With geographical indications, the EU offers an instrument which allows for the declaration of specialties, quali\ufb01ed by their tradition, as typical for a de\ufb01ned area. The declaration serves to protect these products as intellectual and collective property and presents them as culinary heritage, thereby enabling sale at an added value. Accordingly, the EU instrument of geographical indications evokes the interests of a variety of disciplines, such as (agricultural) economics, (social) geography, sociology, anthropology and law. Nonetheless, dialogue and cooperation among the disciplines are quite rare. \u201cTaste | Power | Tradition\u201d gives an insight into this multidisciplinary debate and brings together empirical data and theoretical re\ufb02ections from different perspectives",

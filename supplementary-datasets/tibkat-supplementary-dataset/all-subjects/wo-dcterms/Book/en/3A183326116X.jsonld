                "\"Are business schools on the wrong track? For many years, business schools enjoyed rising enrollments, positive media attention, and growing prestige in the business world. However, due to the disruption of Covid-19, many previously ignored issues relating to MBA programs resurfaced. As a result, MBA programs now face lower enrollments and intense criticism for being deficient in preparing future business leaders and ignoring essential topics like ethics, sustainability, and diversity and inclusion. The Future of Business Schools discusses these issues in the context of three critical areas: complexity, sustainability, and destiny. How do we prepare students for a new and complex world, how can business schools focus on the planet's sustainability, and how will they shape a better future for everyone? The chapters present views and suggestions of business school professors, researchers, and leaders from different contexts and countries as well as ideas for business school stakeholders, on topics from program structures, course content, and teaching materials to research topics. In addition to examples of innovations, there are tools offered to help universities navigate complexity and prepare for uncertainty. The material will assist business school faculty, staff, and administrators as well as professionals, policymakers, and organizations in identifying new directions for business schools in this evolving field\"--",

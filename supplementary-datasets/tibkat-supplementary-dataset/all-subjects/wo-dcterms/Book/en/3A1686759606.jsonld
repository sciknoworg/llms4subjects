                "\"Sunflower: Cultivation, Uses and Ecological Significance is a work that brings together renowned researchers from four different countries with experience and scientific competence in the research of Hellianthus annus L. The book consists of six chapters that present information referenced in years of research on various topics such as: a short sunflower review; an organic fertilization revision; the stages of sunflower development; the sunflower under water stress conditions; the sunflower genetic variability; and the development of composite materials. In each section of this book the authors have provided a little feedback on their extensive work from years of research devoted to the knowledge, domestication and improvement of the use of the species. There are a huge range of sunflower varieties currently being used by modern civilization for different purposes and applications. It is an extremely versatile species that can deliver extraordinary results in different sectors, whether as a highly healthy food in the food industry or as a strategic oilseed for the bioenergy and biofuels segment. It would be impossible to gather all the available information in a single work, however, this small work aims to contribute to the global collection about the species and guide future works that are still needed for the best use of this incredible plant that is the sunflower\"--"

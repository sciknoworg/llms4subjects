            "abstract": "\"Real-Time Visibility in Supply Chain Management applies the paradox theory to understand why real-time visibility expectations and aspirations do not meet supply chain realities. Providing an understanding of the governance of industrial digital platforms for real-time visibility, the book identifies paradoxical tensions among platform partners and explores how to navigate them. The author conceptualizes dynamic patterns of tension evolution among supply chain platform partners and suggests future research directions to advance theorization regarding platform governance and tensions. The successful implementation of digital platforms requires understanding and navigating these paradoxical tensions. The perspective of paradox theory offered in this book can advance our supply chain digitalization understanding as it informs about gaps in thought processes, methodologies, tools, and solutions. The book also explores the role of multiple stakeholders, including platform owners, customers and complementors, in operationalizing real-time visibility to offer new theoretical insights. This book will appeal to researchers and scholars in the areas of supply chain management, operations and logistics, as well as those interested in digitalization and technology management\"--",

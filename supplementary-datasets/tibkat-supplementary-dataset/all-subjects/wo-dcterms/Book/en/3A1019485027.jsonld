                "Engineering Mechanics is one of the fundamental branches of science which is important in the education of professional engineers of any major. Most of the basic engineering courses, such as mechanics of materials, fluid and gas mechanics, machine design, mechatronics, acoustics, vibrations, etc. are based on Engineering Mechanics course. In order to absorb the materials of Engineering Mechanics, it is not enough to consume just theoretical laws and theorems--student also must develop an ability to solve practical problems. Therefore, it is necessary to solve many problems independently. This book is a part of a four-book series designed to supplement the Engineering Mechanics courses in the principles required to solve practical engineering problems in the following branches of mechanics: Statics, Kinematics, Dynamics, and Advanced Kinetics. Each book contains 6-8 topics on its specific branch and each topic features 30 problems to be assigned as homework, tests, and/or midterm/final exams with the consent of the instructor. A solution of one similar sample problem from each topic is provided. This second book in the series contains six topics of Kinematics, the branch of mechanics that is concerned with the analysis of motion of both particle and rigid bodies without reference to the cause of the motion. This book targets undergraduate students at the sophomore/junior level majoring in science and engineering",

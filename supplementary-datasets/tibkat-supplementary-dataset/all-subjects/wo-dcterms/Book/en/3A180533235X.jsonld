                "\u201cWhen it comes to the governance of digital platforms, the question of who is regulating whom is now serious enough that scholars have begun to refer to governments as platforms, too. This volume provides a valuable sampling of how this problem looks from the side of government [\u2026]\u201d \u2014 Sandra Braman, author of Change of State: Information, Policy, and Power; Texas A&M University \u201cThis illuminating collection challenges not only the rule-setting powers of the global digital platforms, but also many of the key assumptions which media and internet studies scholars bring to the field.\u201d \u2014 Julian Thomas, RMIT University, Australia This Open Access volume provides an in-depth exploration of global policy and governance issues related to digital platform regulation. With an international ensemble of contributors, the volume has at its heard the question: what would actually be involved in digital platform regulation?\u2019. Once a specialised and niche field within internet and digital media studies, internet governance has in recent years moved to the forefront of policy debate. In the wake of scandals such as Cambridge Analytica and the global \u2018techlash\u2019 against digital monopolies, platform studies are undergoing a critical turn, but there is a greater need to connect such analysis to questions of public policy. This volume does just that, through a rich array of chapters concretely exploring the operation and influence of digital platforms and their related policy concerns. A wide variety of digital communication platforms are explored, including social media, content portals, search engines and app stores. An important and timely work, \u2018Digital Platform Regulation\u2019 provides valuable insights into new global platform-orientated policy reforms, supplying an important resource to researchers everywhere seeking to engage with policymakers in the debate about the power of digital platforms and how to address it. Terry Flew is Professor of Digital Communications and Culture at The University of Sydney. He is the author of 14 books, including Regulating Platforms (2021) and Understanding Global Media (2018). Fiona R. Martin is Associate Professor in Online and Convergent Media at the University of Sydney, Australia. She is the author of Mediating the Conversation (2022), co-author of Sharing News Online (2019) and co-author and editor of The Value of Public Service Media (2014)."

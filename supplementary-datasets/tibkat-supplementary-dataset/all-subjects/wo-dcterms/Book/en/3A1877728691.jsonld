            "abstract": "1 July 1523, Hendrik Vos and Johan van den Esschen died by burning at  the stake on the Grand-Place in Brussels. They were the first martyrs of  the Reformation.  Following this event, the Faculty of Protestant Theology and Religious  Studies (FPTR) in Brussels organized a colloquium to discuss what has  changed in the 500 years since the first martyrs of the Reformation.  After an historical introduction to set the scene regarding 1 July 1523,  this colloquium dealt with the consequences of the Reformation on  various and diverse topics that include secularization, the role of women, democracy, virtue ethics, interreligious dialogue, ending with a proposal on how to move forward.  This book can be a starting point for further scientific research, especially in the area of secularization, women\u2019s emancipation, and the beginning of the Jewish-Christian dialogue.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Reformation and its  consequences",

            "abstract": "Increased consumer awareness of the effects of food in preventing nutrient-related diseases and maintaining physical and mental well-being has made nutritional improvement an important goal for the food and beverage industry, including the cereal sector. The Book \u201cQualitative and Nutritional Improvement of Cereal-Based Foods and Beverages\u201d collects research articles aimed at exploring innovative ways to improve cereal-based foods and beverages; an old\u2014if not ancient\u2014group of products which are still on our table every day. The main directions of research aimed at nutritional improvement have to face either excess or deficiency in the diet. To this end, different strategies may be adopted, such as the reformulation of products, the introduction of functional ingredients, and the application of biotechnologies to increase the bioavailability of bioactive compounds. These interventions, however, can alter the physico-chemical and sensory properties of final products, making it necessary to achieve a balance between nutritional and quality modification. This book offers readers information on innovative ways to improve cereal-based foods and beverages, useful for researchers and for industry operators",

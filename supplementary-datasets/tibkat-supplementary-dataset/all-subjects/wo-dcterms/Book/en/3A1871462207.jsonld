            "abstract": [
                "This book tackles global economic and social issues from a perspective that may seem obvious but which no author has yet taken: that we humans are living beings. In today\u2019s artificially globalized world, we have increasingly lost sight of our original humanity. Despite the serious environmental, social, and political problems we are facing, we cannot stop focusing on economic growth, efficiency, and liberalization. In doing so, we continue to make the world \u201cslicker\u201d and more unstable. This book identifies these conventional values and ways of thinking as the root cause underlying many of today\u2019s challenges, and it offers the perspective of a \u201cbumpier\u201d and more organic human existence that provides a greater sense of traction and stability. The book begins with a discussion of global systems and structures, proposing a \u201cworld with two systems\u201d to limit the effects of artificially constructed globalization. The second part examines the modern welfare state, outlining a process to revive democracy and social capital by making social issues the business of everyday citizens. The third and final part focuses on human well-being, emphasizing physicality and the Japanese concept of kata as keys to restoring our humanity. Rather than searching for specific solutions through specialized knowledge, this book makes use of the author\u2019s broad perspective acquired through many years of public policy research and reform. It asserts that knowledge should be acquired through hands-on experience and in studies based on real-world situations, involving people at the forefront of society\u2019s challenges, whether politicians, businesspeople, scientists, craftspeople, or farmers. In both its analysis of humanity\u2019s problems and the solutions it offers, this book takes an entirely new yet utterly natural approach to steering humanity off the global economic superhighway. .",

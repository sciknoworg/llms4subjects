            "abstract": "Remote sensing, especially from satellites, is a source of invaluable data which can be used to generate synoptic information for virtually all parts of the Earth, including the atmosphere, land, and ocean. In the last few decades, such data have evolved as a basis for accurate information about the Earth, leading to a wealth of geoscientific analysis focusing on diverse applications. Geoinformation systems based on remote sensing are increasingly becoming an integral part of the current information and communication society. The integration of remote sensing and geoinformation essentially involves combining data provided from both, in a consistent and sensible manner. This process has been accelerated by technologically advanced tools and methods for remote sensing data access and integration, paving the way for scientific advances in a broadening range of remote sensing exploitations in applications of geoinformation. This volume hosts original research focusing on the exploitation of remote sensing in applications of geoinformation. The emphasis is on a wide range of applications, such as the mapping of soil nutrients, detection of plastic litter in oceans, urban microclimate, seafloor morphology, urban forest ecosystems, real estate appraisal, inundation mapping, and solar potential analysis",

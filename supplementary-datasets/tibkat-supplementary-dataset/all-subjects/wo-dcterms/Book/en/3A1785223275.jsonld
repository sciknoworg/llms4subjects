            "abstract": "In recent years, the catchword \"low\u2010code\" has evolved into what can be seen as a major trend in software development platforms. A growing number of vendors respond to this trend by offering software development platforms that promise limited need for coding only and a tre\u2010 mendous boost in productivity. Both aspects have been the subject of intensive research over many years in areas such as domain\u2010specific modeling languages, model\u2010driven software de\u2010 velopment, or generative programming. Therefore, the obvious question is how \u02balow code\u02ba platforms differ from such approaches and what specific performance features they offer. Since there is no unified definition of \"low\u2010code\", the only way to develop an elaborate un\u2010 derstanding of what it is - and might be - is to analyze the actual use of the term. For obvious reasons, it is not promising in this respect to rely on marketing announcements made by ven\u2010 dors. Instead, it seems more appropriate to examine \"low\u2010code\" platforms. This research re\u2010 port presents a study of 10 relevant platforms, capturing and assessing common characteristics as well as specific features of individual tools. The study is guided by a method that consists of a conceptual framework, which provides a uniform structure to describe and compare \"low\u2010 code\" platforms, and a process model that describes the sequence of steps.",

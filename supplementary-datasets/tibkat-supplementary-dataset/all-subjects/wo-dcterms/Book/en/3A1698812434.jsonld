                "What should we do when autonomy and rationality seem to be in conflict in medical decision-making, as when there seems no good reason for a patient's wishes? Jonathan Pugh offers a new framework for thinking about the concept of autonomy, grounded in an understanding of the different roles that rational beliefs and rational desires have to play. Personal autonomy is often lauded as a key value in contemporary Western bioethics, and the claim that there is an important relationship between autonomy and rationality is often treated as an uncontroversial claim in this sphere. Yet, there is also considerable disagreement about how we should cash out the relationship between rationality and autonomy. In particular, it is unclear whether a rationalist view of autonomy can be compatible with legal judgments that enshrine a patient\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment, regardless of whether \u2018\u2026 the reasons for making the choice are rational, irrational, unknown or even non-existent\u2019. This book brings recent philosophical work on the nature of rationality to bear on the question of how we should understand autonomy in contemporary bioethics. In doing so, the author develops a new framework for thinking about the concept, one that is grounded in an understanding of the different roles that rational beliefs and rational desires have to play in personal autonomy. Furthermore, the account outlined here allows for a deeper understanding of different forms of controlling influence, and the relationship between our freedom to act, and our capacity to decide autonomously. The author contrasts his rationalist account with other prominent accounts of autonomy in bioethics, and outlines the revisionary implications it has for various practical questions in bioethics in which autonomy is a salient concern, including questions about the nature of informed consent and decision-making capacity."

            "abstract": "The evolution of medical equipment engineering is progressing rapidly, with advances in digital healthcare technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality, 3D-printing, robotics and nanotechnologies developing at pace. Medical equipment engineering can assist in surveying workplace inefficiencies, and develop efficient optimisation processes, through data research and intelligent learning automation. This edited book covers the benefits of the integration of lean manufacturing, smart sensors, 5G technology, IoTs, virtual reality, 3D printing, robotics and automation. \"Medical Equipment Engineering: Design, manufacture and applications\" discusses the technological requirements that bring robots closer to humans in smart equipment manufacturing environments where computer-integrated equipment manufacturing, high levels of adaptability and rapid equipment design changes are successfully integrated with digital information technology, while ensuring that these new processes still protect worker safety. A holistic view of medical equipment engineering will affect many areas, most notably: equipment services and engineering business models, equipment reliability and continuous productivity, machine safety, standards and maintenance, IT security and equipment product lifecycles. Topics such as industry value chain, industry demonstration and technicians and workers' education and skills will also be explored. This book is essential reading for all engineers and designers working in medical equipment manufacturing, and related fields such as AI, virtual reality, smart sensors, 3D printing, robotics and automation",

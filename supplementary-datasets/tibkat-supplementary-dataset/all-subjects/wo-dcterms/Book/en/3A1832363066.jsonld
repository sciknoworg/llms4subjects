It would have been equally appropriate to compare, in a more direct way, what was happening in northern Europe with respect to Mediterranean Europe, bearing in mind the role of Protestantism, very far from clothing that was too flashy. The role of colors and themes, also of an artistic nature, that transpired from clothing also refer to other aspects that will have to be taken up on other occasions",

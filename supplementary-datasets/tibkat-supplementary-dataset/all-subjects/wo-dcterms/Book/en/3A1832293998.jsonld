            "abstract": "The fourth volume of the \"Passage des disciplines\" collection looks at how the discipline of art history was established at the Coll\u00e8ge de France by forging a special link with the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. Georges Lafenestre, Andr\u00e9 Michel, Paul Vitry, and Ren\u00e9 Huyghe were curators in the Department of Paintings and Drawings and the Department of Medieval, Renaissance and Modern Sculptures, before holding the Chair of Aesthetics and Art History, created in 1878 and once renamed \"History of French Art\" (1920-1925), or the municipal chair, \"Psychology of Visual Arts\" (1951-1976), financed by the City of Paris. By electing several curators to its chairs in this way, does the Coll\u00e8ge de France single itself out among the institutions at which aesthetics and art history are taught? What determines the recruitment of curators? To what extent does their museum experience weigh on their appointment? Once elected, what ties do they maintain with the Louvre? Do they integrate the museum's debates on aesthetics or historical method into their teaching at the Coll\u00e8ge de France? Such are some of the questions that the authors of this volume explore, drawing on the archives of various institutions. This volume ensues from a study day organised by Jessica Desclaux (Sorbonne Universit\u00e9-Mus\u00e9e du Louvre/Centre Dominique-Vivant Denon) on 4 April 2019, as part of the research programme \"Passage des disciplines: global history of the Coll\u00e8ge de France, 19th-20th century\". The programme focuses on the selection process of chairs and fields of study at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, including those that were not admitted to it and which formed a \"virtual college\", from the late 18th century to the 1960s. It is directed by Antoine Compagnon, with the collaboration of C\u00e9line Surprenant, and has received financial support from PSL (2016-2019) and the R\u00e9publique des Savoirs",

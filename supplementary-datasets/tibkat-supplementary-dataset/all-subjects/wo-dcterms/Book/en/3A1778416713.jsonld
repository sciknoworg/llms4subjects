            "abstract": "The energy transition is one of the key approaches in the effort to halt climate changes, and it has become even more essential in the light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Fostering the energy efficiency and the energy independence of the building sector is a focal aim to move towards a decarbonized society. In this context, building physics and building energy systems are fundamental disciplines based on applied physics applications in civil, architectural, and environmental engineering, including technical themes related to the planning of energy and the environment, diagnostic methods, and mitigating techniques. This Special Issue contains information on experimental studies in the following research topics: renewable energy sources, building energy analysis, rational use of energy, heat transmission, heating and cooling systems, thermofluid dynamics, smart energy systems, and energy service management in buildings",

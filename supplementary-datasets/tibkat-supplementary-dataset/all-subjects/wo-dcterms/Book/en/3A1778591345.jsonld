A Pilot Study on Calculus' from book: Adaptive and Adaptable Learning: 11th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2016, Lyon, France, September 13-16, 2016, Proceedings",
            "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a pilot study about students\u2019 adoption and learning outcomes of 4 MOOCs proposed as a complementary resource for traditional remedial courses on calculus. While the MOOCs were not mandatory, traditional remedial courses were required for those freshmen failing a diagnostic exam. The effects on 589 freshmen students were investigated. The data analysis shows that up to 16 % of the students were active in the MOOCs under study, mostly during the days before taking the diagnostic exam that preceded the traditional face-to-face remedial courses. Trace data about learner actions within the platform were collected as well as the students\u2019 scores. According to a statistical comparison of the students\u2019 exam scores and their interaction behavior with the MOOCs, we observe that active students had more chances of passing the diagnostic exam and skipping the required remedial courses. However, we found no significant differences on the remedial course exam scores between the students that were active in the MOOCs and those that were not. These findings suggest that MOOCs are a good solution to strengthening skills and reviewing concepts, but that more guidance is needed when used as a complement to traditional f2f courses",

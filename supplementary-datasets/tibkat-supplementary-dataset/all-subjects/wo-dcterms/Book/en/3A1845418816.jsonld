Author Nivaldo Tro draws upon his classroom experience as an award-winning instructor to extend chemistry from the laboratory to the student\u2019s world, capturing student attention with relevant applications and an engaging writing style. The text provides a superior teaching and learning experience, enabling deep conceptual understanding, fostering the development of problem-solving skills, and encouraging interest in chemistry with concrete examples. Extending chemistry from the lab to the student\u2019s world, the text reveals that anyone can master chemistry.  Refined to meet its purpose of teaching relevant skills, the 6th Edition includes new questions, data, and sections to help students build the 21st century skills necessary to succeed in introductory chemistry and beyond. Already a visual text, in this edition the art has been further refined and improved, making the visual impact sharper and more targeted to student learning. The new edition also includes new Conceptual Checkpoints, a widely embraced feature that emphasizes understanding rather than calculation, as well as a new category of end-of-chapter questions called Data Interpretation and Analysis, which present real data in real life situations and ask students to analyze and interpret that data.

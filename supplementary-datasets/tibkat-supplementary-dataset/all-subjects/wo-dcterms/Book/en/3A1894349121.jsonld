            "abstract": "\"This lushly photographed idea book proves that it is possible to create a glamorous outdoor space of ever-changing color, teeming with life, in the smallest of spaces, whether a patio, terrace, or front porch.  This inspirational guide demonstrates how a glorious outdoor space is possible, even with only a small patio and a few pots. Featuring detailed photos and text by Parkinson who has been named a rising gardening star by Architectural Digest, this new book is the key to success with container gardening. Parkinson shows how to create a veritable paradise in pots with aspirational season-by-season ideas that are easy to replicate in any situation. The emphasis is on creating a small haven for birds, butterflies, and other wildlife--from flowers for pollinators to small fruiting shrubs that provide winter sustenance for birds. Even an upturned pot can create a welcoming space for a mosquito-eating frog. The book is filled with planting and propagating advice, tips on improving soil, seasonal tasks, and suggested planting ideas that include both flowering and edible plants for a vibrant backyard oasis. This is container gardening at its most romantic and stylish.\" --",

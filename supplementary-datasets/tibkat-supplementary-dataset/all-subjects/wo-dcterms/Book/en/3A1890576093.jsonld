                "This book offers a comprehensive analysis of infrastructure insecurity issues in the historic Niger Delta, drawing on empirical fieldwork involving host communities, regulators, and multinational oil and gas operators. It introduces innovative models and theories, such as a pipeline life cycle model focusing on community development, community neglect aggression displacement theory, social aggression theory, stakeholders\u2019 policy development model, contemporary poor governance cycle model, and an infrastructure insecurity nexus model, linking governance, socio-economic conditions, and infrastructure insecurity in resource-rich regions of the Global South. The book bridges gaps left by previous publications, providing depth and applicability of data. It employs the Frustration- Aggression Displacement theory to explain underlying triggers of violence and uses real-world case studies, diagrams, and charts to facilitate understanding. Suitable and engaging for individuals, communities, or regulators involved in oil and gas activities alike, this book offers valuable insights into onshore pipeline infrastructure insecurity in Nigeria, West Africa, and the broader Global South, addressing regulation, compliance, environmental concerns, social aspects, and technological innovations. Abdul L. Abraham Jatto\u2019s research is focussed on oil and gas pipeline infrastructure insecurity in the Niger Delta, with expertise in contemporary political security and resilient infrastructure security. Following a PhD in Politics from the University of Lincoln, focusing on onshore oil and gas pipeline infrastructure insecurity problems in the Niger Delta region. It involved the design of integrative security and socio-economic models for safe transportation of oil and gas, infrastructure security. He has developed a proven interest and experience in the broad spectrum of Nigeria\u2019s human and national security architecture and community development drawing on multi-disciplinary academic qualifications and professionalism. He is an appointed subject expert Judge in Politics and International Relations for the Global Undergraduate Award, Dublin, and has published across many reputable scholarly journals in the field. ."

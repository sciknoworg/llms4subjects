            "abstract": "This report examines the key challenges faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Kyrgyz Republic, in an attempt to identify the issues and areas in most urgent need of reform. The IFC Study of Investment Climate as seen by Small and Medium Enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic is the first survey of the investment climate in the Kyrgyz Republic conducted by IFC. One of the key objectives of the IFC Study of Investment Climate as seen by Small and Medium Enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic is to identify precisely those areas in greatest need of reform, in order to reduce the regulatory burden and enable policy makers in the Kyrgyz Republic to establish priorities to encourage new business development and growth, resulting in higher employment and reducing poverty. Data contained in the Survey provide a basis on which the most viable potential reforms might be assessed. The introductory chapter to this report paints a general picture of the macro-economic situation in the Kyrgyz Republic, as well as providing a data-driven description of each of the three categories of enterprises covered in the Survey - individual entrepreneurs, small and medium companies, and farmers. Chapters 3 through 8 provide a detailed examination of Survey findings on a variety of key topics, and each chapter begins with an explanation of the legal and regulatory framework of that issue. Chapter 9 provides an overview of the survey methodology. Finally, the Data Annex presents additional findings on issues covered under Access to Finance and Foreign Trade",

            "abstract": "\"Sensors are effective tools to carry out cost-effective, fast, and reliable sensing for a wide range of applications. This volume, Nanomaterials-Based Sensing Platforms: Towards the Efficient Detection of Biomolecules and Gases, presents a brief history behind the sensing technology and also emphasizes a broad range of biosensing techniques based on optical and electrochemical response methods. Starting from the traditional enzyme-based biosensing method to functionalized nanostructure-based sensors, this book also provides a detailed overview of some of the advanced sensing methodologies based on photonic crystal cavity-based sensing devices. The authors have compiled the book keeping in mind the extraordinary success history of nanomaterials, their current strategical exploitation, and an unprecedented pool of possibilities they hold for the future. Many of the technologies have been developed recently for the sensing of various bio-analytes and molecules, some of which have been included in this book through dedicated chapters in a highly organized manner. The book looks at the various sensors, such as for biosensing, electrochemical sensing, gas sensing, photo-electrochemical sensing, and colorimetric sensing, all of which have shown potential. This volume will be valuable for professors, scientists, graduate students, industry professionals, researchers, and libraries. Many universities, institutes, and colleges are offering courses on nanotechnology, nanoscience, materials sciences, and this volume will be a helpful ancillary text\"--",

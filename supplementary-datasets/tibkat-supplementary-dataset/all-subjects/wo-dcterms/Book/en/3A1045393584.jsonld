                "Consumers are increasingly looking to invest in experiences rather than simply a product. With innovation research moving away from the traditional focus on manufacturing towards services, this book develops a much-needed integrated approach for improving analysis of both experience and service innovation. This impressive book makes a substantial and compelling contribution to research on the interdependencies between innovation, services and experiences. Split into clear and thematically separate categories, the contributors explore systemic innovation, practice-based innovation, technology and innovation, and experiences as a catalyst for innovation. Examples are taken from the tourism industry, entrepreneurial ventures, online gaming and digital services, to provide readers with a thorough overview of the extensive impact of these innovations. Using organizational, systemic, conceptual and empirical examinations of the experience and service economies, the authors identify how top class innovation research can be extended and integrated further with other research areas. Presenting a state-of-the-art analysis of the topic, this timely book will benefit teachers of innovation, the experience economy, and information systems. Researchers of business economics, and marketing will also find this an essential foundation volume for future research on topics of innovation in a globalizing world",

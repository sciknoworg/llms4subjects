            "abstract": "Baroque Lorca: An Archaist Playwright for the New Stage defines Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s trajectory in the theater as a lifelong search for an audience. It studies a wide range of dramatic writings that Lorca created for the theater, in direct response to the conditions of his contemporary industry, and situates the theory and praxis of his theatrical reform in dialogue with other modernist renovators of the stage. This book makes special emphasis on how Lorca engaged with the tradition of Spanish Baroque, in particular with Cervantes and Calder\u00f3n, to break away from the conventions of the illusionist stage. The five chapters of the book analyze Lorca\u2019s different attempts to change the dynamics of the Spanish stage from 1920 to his assassination in 1936: His initial incursions in the arenas of symbolist and historical drama (The Butterfly\u2019s Evil Spell, Mariana Pineda); his interest in puppetry (The Billy-Club Puppets and In the Frame of Don Crist\u00f3bal) and the two \u2018human\u2019 farces The Shoemaker\u2019s Prodigious Wife and The Love of Don Perlimpl\u00edn and Belisa in the Garden; the central piece in his project of \u2018impossible\u2019 theater (The Public); his most explicitly political play, one that takes the violence to the spectators\u2019 seats (The Dream of Life); and his three plays adopting, an altering, the contemporary formula of \u2018rural drama\u2019 (Blood Wedding, Yerma and The House of Bernarda Alba)",

                "It is with great pleasure and satisfaction that I present to the international scientific community this collection of papers presented at the symposium on Surface Phenomena in Enhanced Oil Recovery held at Stockholm, Sweden, during August 20-25, 1979. It has been an exciting and exhausting experience to edit the papers included in this volume. The proceedings cover six major areas of research related to chemical flooding processes for enhanced oil recovery, namely, 1) Fundamental aspects of the oil displacement process, 2) Micro\u00ad structure of surfactant systems, 3) Emulsion rheology and oil dis\u00ad placement mechanisms, 4) Wettability and oil displacement mecha\u00ad nisms, 5) Adsorption, clays and chemical loss mechanisms, and 6) Polymer rheology and surfactant-polymer interactions. This book also includes two invited review papers, namely, \"Research on Enhanced Oil Recovery: Past, Present and Future,\" and \"Formation and Properties of Micelles and Microemulsions\" by Professor J. J. Taber and Professor H. F. Eicke respectively. This symposium volume reflects the current state-of-art and our understanding of various surface phenomena in enhanced oil recovery processes. The participation by researchers from various countries in this symposium reflects the global interest in this area of research and the international effort to develop che science and technology of enhanced oil recovery processes."

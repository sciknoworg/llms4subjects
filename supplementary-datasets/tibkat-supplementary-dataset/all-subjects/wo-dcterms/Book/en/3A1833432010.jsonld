                "This book is devoted to the problem of sampled-data control of finite-dimensional linear continuous periodic (FDLCP) objects. It fills a deficit in coverage of this important subject. The methods presented here are based on the parametric transfer matrix, which has proven successful in the study of sampled-data systems with linear time-invariant objects. The book shows that this concept can be successfully transferred to sampled-data systems with FDLCP objects. It is set out in five parts: an introduction to the frequency approach for the mathematical description of FDLCP objects including the determination of their structure and their representation as a serial connection of periodic modulators and a linear time-invariant object; construction of parametric transfer matrix for different types of open and closed sampled-data systems with FDLCP objects; the solution of problems of causal modal control of FDLCP objects based on the mathematical apparatus of determinant polynomial equations; consideration of the problem of constructing a quadratic quality functional for the H2-optimization problem of a single-loop synchronous sampled-data system with control delay; description of the general H2-optimization procedure. Necessary mathematical reference material is included at relevant points in the book. Sampled-Data Control for Periodic Objects is of use to: scientists and engineers involved in research and design of systems of systems with FDLCP objects; graduate students wishing to broaden their scope of competence; their instructors; and mathematicians working in the field of control theory.",

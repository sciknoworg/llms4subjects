            "abstract": "The Routledge Handbook of European Integrations fills a significant gap in the European studies literature by providing crucial and groundbreaking coverage of several key areas that are usually neglected or excluded in European integration collections. Whilst still examining the largest and most influential institutions, bodies and highly funded policy areas as acknowledged dominant topics in European studies, it crucially does so with much greater balance by devoting equal billing to areas such as such as culture in European integration or new technologies and their impact on the EU. Organised around three main sections \u2013 culture, technology and \u2018tangibles\u2019 \u2013 the book: \u2022 offers an authoritative \u2018encyclopaedia\u2019 to \u2018alternative\u2019 areas in European integration, from media, football, Erasmus and Tourism, to transport, space, AI and energy; \u2022 retains coverage of the dominant topics in European Studies, such as the Eurozone, the Common Internal Market, or European Law, but in balance with other areas of interest; \u2022 provides an essential companion to existing scholarship in European Studies.  The Routledge Handbook of European Integrations is essential reading and an authoritative reference for scholars, students, researchers and practitioners involved in, and actively concerned about, research in the study of European integration/studies",

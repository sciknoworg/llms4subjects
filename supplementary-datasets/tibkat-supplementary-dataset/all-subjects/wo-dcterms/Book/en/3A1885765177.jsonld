This chapter sets out to look at the meaning of the term \u2018forced migrant\u2019 and the challenges faced in integrating migrants into the labour market. The movement of people has included many skilled professionals, including staff and students from Ukrainian universities. This chapter examines some issues in integrating such groups into the workforce. It also looks at some of the schemes set up to enable displaced researchers to continue with their research and the potential benefits which this offers for participants",

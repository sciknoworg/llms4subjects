The topics covered in the individual reviews include structural aspects (domain architecture, homologs and paralogs, and structure), biochemical properties (mechanism, sequence specificity, product specificity, regulation, and histone and non-histone substrates), cellular features (subcellular localization, expression patterns, cellular roles and function, biological effects of substrate protein methylation, connection to cell signaling pathways, and connection to chromatin regulation) and their role in diseases. This review book is a useful resource for scientists working on protein methylation and protein methyltransferases and those interested in joining this emerging research field",

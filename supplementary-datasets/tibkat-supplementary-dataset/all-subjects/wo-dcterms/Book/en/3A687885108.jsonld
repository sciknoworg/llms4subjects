            "abstract": "\"Preface The first edition of the book Biomedical Signal and Image Processing was published by CRC Press in 2005. It was used by many universities and educational institutions as a textbook for upper undergraduate level and first year graduate level courses in signal and image processing. It was also used by a number of companies and research institutions as a reference book for their research projects. This highly encouraging impact of the first edition motivated me to look into ways to improve the book and create a second edition. The second edition you have in hand has the following improvements compared to the first edition: - A number of editorial corrections have been made to address the typos, grammatical errors, and ambiguities in some mathematical equations. - Many examples have been added to almost all chapters, of which the majority are MATLAB\u02bc examples, further illustrating the concepts described in the text. - Further explanations and justifications have been provided for some signal and image processing concepts that may have needed more illustration. Finally, I would like to thank all the people who contacted me and my coauthor, Dr. Splinter, and shared with us their thoughts and ideas regarding this book. I hope that you find the second edition even more useful than the first one!

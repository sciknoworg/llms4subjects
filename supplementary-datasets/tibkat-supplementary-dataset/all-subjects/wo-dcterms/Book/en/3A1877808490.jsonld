This book gathers together leading scholars in the field to examine this impact, which is crucial to understanding the region\u2019s current problems and the rise of groups like the Islamic State.In addition to recounting the crucial international politics that drew fierce lines in the sands of the Middle East\u2014a story of intrigue between the British, Russians, Ottomans, North Africans, Americans, and others\u2014the contributors engage topics ranging from the war\u2019s effects on women, the experience of the Kurds, sectarianism, the evolution of Islamism, and the importance of prominent intellectuals like Ziya G\u00f6kalp and Michel \u2019Aflaq. They examine the dissolution of the Ottoman empire, the exploitation of notions of Islamic unity and pan-Arabism, the influences of Woodrow Wilson and American ideals on Middle East leaders, and likewise the influence of Vladimir Lenin\u2019s vision of a communist utopia. Altogether, they tell a story of promises made and promises broken, of the struggle between self-determination and international recognition, of centuries-old empires laying in ruin, and of the political poker of the twentieth century that carved up the region, separating communities into the artificial states we know today",

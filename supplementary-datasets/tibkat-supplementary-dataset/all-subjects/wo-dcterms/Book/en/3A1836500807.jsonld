            "abstract": "ICCEDI is an international seminar that is held every two years organized by the Law and Citizenship Department, Faculty of Social Science Universitas Negeri Malang. The activities aim to discuss the theoretical and practical citizenship education that becomes needed for democracy in Indonesia and other countries with a view to build academic networks by gathering academics from various research institutes and universities. Citizenship education is an urgent need for the nation in order to build a civilized democracy for several reasons. Citizenship education is important for those who are politically illiterate and do not know how to work the democracy of its institutions. Another problem is the increasing political apathy, indicated by the limited involvement of citizens in the political process. These conditions show how citizenship education becomes the means needed by a democratic country like Indonesia. The book addresses a number of important issues, such as law issues, philosophy of moral values, political government, socio-cultural and Pancasila, and civic education. Finally, it offers a conceptual framework for future democracy. This book will be of interest to students, scholars, and practitioners, governance, and other related stakeholders",

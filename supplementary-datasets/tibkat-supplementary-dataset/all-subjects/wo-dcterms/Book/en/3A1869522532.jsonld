                "Structure and power are two defining and interrelated aspects of the German theater business. It is based on the strictly hierarchical organization of 1900 and has undergone hardly any structural changes since then. This not only impairs the innovative capacity of this important institution, but also leads to inappropriately strong power positions of the directors, to conflicts with the ensembles and employees, and hinders the development and renewal of the artistic potentials of this cultural technique. The publication is based on the results of the study 'Art and Power in the Theater' - with 1966 participants the largest study of its kind. The content Power as a decision-making and management tool in the theater The connection between power and organization Power and abuse in the theater Structural power and forms of power containment Results of the study The target groups Students, teachers and researchers in the fields of cultural management, cultural and theater studies, dramaturgy, psychology, sociology and anthropology, employees of management in theaters and other cultural organizations. The author Thomas Schmidt has been a professor and director of the Theater and Orchestra Management program in Frankfurt since 2010. He was managing director of the National Theater Weimar from 2003 to 2013 and visiting professor at Harvard University in 2014. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence. A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content.",

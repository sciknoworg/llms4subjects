            "abstract": "This book is a comprehensive set of articles reflecting on the application of symbolic and/or numerical computation in a range of scientific areas within the fields of engineering and science. These articles constitute extended versions of communications presented at the 4th International Conference on Numerical and Symbolic Computation\u2014SYMCOMP 2019\u2014that took place in Porto, Portugal, from 11 to 12 April 2019 The different chapters present diverse perspectives on the existing effective connections between mathematical methods and procedures and other knowledge areas. The intrinsic multidisciplinary character is visible throughout the whole book as a result of the applicability of the scope and the applications considered. The reader will find this book to be a useful resource for identifying problems of interest in different engineering and science areas, and in the development of mathematical models and procedures used in the context of prediction or verification computational tools as well as in the aided-learning/teaching context. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the recent developments and applications of symbolic and numerical computation for a number of multidisciplinary engineering and science problems",

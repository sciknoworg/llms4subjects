                "Entrepreneurs act in environments of great risk and high uncertainty, and as a result, failure is a common occurrence. Professor Shepherd has made a judicious selection of published articles, which explore the antecedents to and potential outcomes of entrepreneurial failure. By understanding these causes and consequences, entrepreneurs may become better able to manage failure, to reduce its costs and to capitalize on its benefits"

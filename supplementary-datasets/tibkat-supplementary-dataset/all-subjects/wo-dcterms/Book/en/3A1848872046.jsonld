                "Learn the basics of writing SQL scripts. Using Standard SQL as the starting point, this book teaches writing SQL in various popular dialects, including PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and SQLite. The book starts with a general introduction to writing SQL and covers the basic concepts. Author Mark Simon then covers database principles, and how database tables are designed. He teaches you how to filter data using the WHERE clause, and you will work with NULL, numbers, dates, and strings. You will also understand sorting results using the ORDER BY clause, sorting by calculated columns, and limiting the number of results. By the end of the book, you will know how to insert and update data, and summarize data with aggregate functions and groups. Three appendices cover differences between SQL dialects, working with tables, and a crash course in PDO. What You Will Learn Filter, sort, and calculate data Summarize data with aggregate functions Modify data with insert, update, and delete statements Study design principles in developing a database Who This Book Is For Developers and analysts working with SQL, as well as web developers who want a stronger understanding of working with databases Mark Simon has been involved in training and education since the beginning of his career. He started as a teacher of mathematics and moved into IT consultancy and training. He has worked with and trained in several programming and coding languages, and currently focuses on web development and database languages."

                "Einstein once remarked \"After a certain high level of technical skill is achieved, science and art tend to coalesce in aesthetics, plasticity, and form. The greatest scientists are always artists as well\". In this volume, some of the world\u2019s leading thinkers come together to expound on the interrelations between sciences and arts. While one can segregate art and place it outside the scientific realm, it is, nevertheless, inextricably linked to our essential cognitive/emotional/perceptual modalities and abilities, and therefore lies alongside and in close contact with the method of science and philosophy. What inspiration can scientists draw from art and how can scientific spirit foster our understanding and creation of aesthetic works? How are art and science grounded in our cognition? What role does perception play in science and art? Are criteria for beauty in art and science the same? How does evolution shape our understanding of art? How do science, art and scientifico-artistic frameworks shape society as a whole and help us address its pressing issues? The epistemological and ontological aspects haunt artists, philosophers and scientists alike. The essays in this volume address these manifold questions while also elucidating the pragmatic role they play in our daily life",

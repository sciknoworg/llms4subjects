            "abstract": "\"Using many real-world examples and cases, this book identifies key factors and processes that have contributed to the creation of successful new products, buildings and innovations, or resulted in some failures. Such factors include the creativity of individuals and groups, their sources of inspiration, the processes of creative design and innovation, and the characteristics of the products, buildings and innovations themselves. Much has been written about creativity and innovation, but what helps to foster creativity, enable creative ideas to be translated into practical designs, and ensure those new products or buildings succeed as innovations on the market or in use? This book discusses these elements through the author's origination and analysis of examples and case studies ranging from the revolutionary innovation of the smartphone, through radical innovations in domestic appliances and sustainable housing, to creative designs of contemporary jewellery. The broad range of examples and cases include product and fashion design, filmmaking and fine art as well as industrial design, engineering and architecture, offering lessons for creatives, designers and innovators from many subject backgrounds. Analysis of the different factors, successes and failures are presented in text boxes throughout the book to allow readers to easily understand the key lessons from each example or case, with numerous colour visuals, diagrams and charts for illustration. This book is a must-read for a broad audience interested in creativity, design and innovation, including practitioners in design, engineering, architecture and product management, and students and instructors of those subjects\"--",

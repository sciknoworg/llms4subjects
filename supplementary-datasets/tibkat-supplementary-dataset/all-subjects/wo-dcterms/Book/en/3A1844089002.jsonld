                "This monograph is designed to be an in-depth introduction to domination in graphs. It focuses on three core concepts: domination, total domination, and independent domination. It contains major results on these foundational domination numbers, including a wide variety of in-depth proofs of selected results providing the reader with a toolbox of proof techniques used in domination theory. Additionally, the book is intended as an invaluable reference resource for a variety of readerships, namely, established researchers in the field of domination who want an updated, comprehensive coverage of domination theory; next, researchers in graph theory who wish to become acquainted with newer topics in domination, along with major developments in the field and some of the proof techniques used; and, graduate students with interests in graph theory, who might find the theory and many real-world applications of domination of interest for masters and doctoral thesis topics. The focused coverage also provides a good basis for seminars in domination theory or domination algorithms and complexity. The authors set out to provide the community with an updated and comprehensive treatment on the major topics in domination in graphs. And by Jove, they\u2019ve done it! In recent years, the authors have curated and published two contributed volumes: Topics in Domination in Graphs, \u00a9 2020 and Structures of Domination in Graphs, \u00a9 2021. This book rounds out the coverage entirely. The reader is assumed to be acquainted with the basic concepts of graph theory and has had some exposure to graph theory at an introductory level. As graph theory terminology sometimes varies, a glossary of terms and notation is provided at the end of the book."

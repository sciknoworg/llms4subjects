The conference was the thirteenth in a series of meetings in Approximation Theory held at various locations in the United States, and was attended by 144 participants. The book will be of interest to mathematicians, engineers, and computer scientists working in approximation theory, computer-aided geometric design, numerical analysis, and related application areas. It contains a carefully refereed and edited selection of papers. Along with the many plenary speakers, the contributors to this proceedings provided inspiring talks and set a high standard of exposition in their descriptions of new directions for research.\u00a1 Many relevant topics in approximation theory are included in this book, such as abstract approximation, approximation with constraints, interpolation and smoothing, wavelets and frames, shearlets, orthogonal polynomials, univariate and multivariate splines, and complex approximation.\u00a1 Marian Neamtu is Professor of Mathematics at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.\u00a1 Larry L.

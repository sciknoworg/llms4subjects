            "abstract": "This book uses kinematics, mechanics, mathematics, and so on, to systematically propose the fixturing performance evaluation and fixturing layout planning method. The proposed method is a novel method, including the analysis method of locating determination, the analysis method of workpiece stability, the analysis method of clamping reasonability, the analysis method of workpiece attachment/detachment, the analysis method of locating accuracy, and the planning algorithm of locating point layout, the planning algorithm of clamping force, and so forth. It can enrich and develop the basic theory of computer aided fixture design, change the empirical method of fixture design. The combination of theoretical analysis and mathematical modeling technology can resolve the key problems in the process of fixture design, which will play a certain role in promoting the progress of manufacturing technology, improving the precision and level of product manufacturing, and meeting the higher and higher requirements of mechanical manufacturing industry. .",

            "abstract": "Numerical methods and related computer based algorithms form the logical solution for. many complex problems encountered in science and engineering. Although numerical techniques are now well established, they have continued to expand and diversify, particularly in the fields of engineering analysis and design. Various engineering departments in the University College of Swansea, in particular, Civil, Chemical, Electrical and Computer Science, have groups working in these areas. It is from this mutual interest that the NUMETA conference series was conceived with the main objective of providing a link between engineers developing new numerical techniques and those applying them in practice. Encouraged by the success of NUMETA '85, the second conference, NUMETA '87, was held at Swansea, 6-10 July 1987. Over two hundred and twenty abstracts were submitted for consideration together with a number of invited papers from experts in the field of numerical methods. The final selection of contributed and invited papers were of a high quality and have culminated in the two volumes which form these proceedings. This volume contains papers on the themes of 'Numerical Techniques for Engineering Analysis and Design' and 'Developments in Engineering Software'. Many new developments on a wide variety of topics have been reported and these proceedings contain a wealth of information and references which we believe will be of great interest to theoreticians and practising engineers alike",

            "abstract": "Given the rapid growth of engineering fields, namely the food industry with novel food process technologies, novel ingredients, advanced enzyme production and applications, and other complementary technologies, this book will disclose the latest trends in food engineering. This text is a compilation of selected research articles and reviews covering current efforts in research in and application of emerging technologies in the food industry. The chapters in this book are divided into three broad sections. Section 1 deals with introductory information about enzyme application, preserving treatments (such as thermal treatment, active packaging concepts) in a sustainable, cost-effective manner, inclusion in food processing of wild edible plants as a part of cultural and generic heritage, and the upscaling of extraction techniques to increase the bioavailability of bioactive compounds. Section 2 provides data concerning the food industry's emerging technologies. Section 3 reveals the latest trends in food fortification. Overall, this book serves as an inspiring source for both scientific and industrial actors or anyone involved in any aspect related to the food industry",

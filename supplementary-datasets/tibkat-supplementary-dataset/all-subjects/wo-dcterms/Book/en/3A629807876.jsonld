            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, The laws relating to the environment and health and safety have become so closely interrelated that the previous edition of the Pocket Guide to Environmental Law has been completely revised, updated and enlarged to include Health and Safety Law. The resulting Health, Safety and Environment Legislation: A Pocket Guide is divided into 17 sections, each of which is subdivided, with the relevant legislation easily identified within the sections. A list of contents and an index are also included. All material is current as of November 2002, and includes recently introduced legislation such as CHIP 3, GMOs (Deliberate Release), Control of Asbestos at Work, COSHH and Control of Lead at Work. This guide will be useful to all employers and employees, but especially so to those employed to advise their colleagues on health, safety and environmental law. It is therefore designed to be a first port-of-call for quick and easy access to reference information, which can readily be carried to meetings or taken out on site",

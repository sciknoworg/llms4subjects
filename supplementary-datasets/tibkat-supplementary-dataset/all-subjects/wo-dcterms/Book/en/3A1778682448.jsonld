            "abstract": "The Discrete Event Simulation (DES) method has received widespread attention and acceptance by both researchers and practitioners in recent years. The range of application of DES spans across many different disciplines and research fields. In research, further development and advancements of the basic DES algorithm continue to be sought while various hybrid methods derived by combining DES with other simulation techniques continue to be developed. This book presents state-of-the-art contributions on fundamental development of the DES method, novel integration of the method with other modeling techniques as well as applications towards simulating and analyzing the performances of various types of systems. This book will be of interest to undergraduate and graduate students, researchers as well as professionals who are actively engaged in DES related work",

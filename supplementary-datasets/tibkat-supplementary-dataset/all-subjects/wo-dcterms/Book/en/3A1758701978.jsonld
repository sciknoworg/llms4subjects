            "abstract": [
                "\"Numerous problems from diverse disciplines can be converted using mathematical modeling to an equation defined on suitable abstract spaces usually involving the n-dimensional Euclidean space, Hilbert space, Banach Space or even more general spaces. The solution of these equations is sought in closed form. But this is possible only in special cases. That is why researchers and practitioners use iterative algorithms, which seem to be the only alternative. Due to the explosion of technology, faster and faster computers become available. This development simply means that new optimized algorithms should be developed to take advantage of these improvements. That is exactly where we come in with our book containing such algorithms with applications in problems from numerical analysis and economics but also from other areas such as biology, chemistry, physics, parallel computing, and engineering. The book is an outgrowth of scientific research conducted over two years. This book can be used by senior undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers, and practitioners in the aforementioned areas in the classroom or as reference material. Readers should know the fundamentals of numerical-functional analysis, economic theory, and Newtonian physics. Some knowledge of computers and contemporary programming shall be very helpful to readers\"--",

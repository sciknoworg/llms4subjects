            "abstract": "For decades gas chromatography has been and will remain an irreplaceable analytical technique in many research areas for both quantitative analysis and qualitative characterization/identification, which is still supplementary with HPLC. This book highlights a few areas where significant advances have been reported recently and/or a revisit of basic concepts is deserved. It provides an overview of instrumental developments, frontline and modern research as well as practical industrial applications. The topics include GC-based metabolomics in biomedical, plant and microbial research, natural products as well as characterization of aging of synthetic materials and industrial monitoring, which are contributions of several experts from different disciplines. It also contains best hand-on practices of sample preparation (derivatization) and data processing in daily research. This book is recommended to both basic and experienced researchers in gas chromatography",

            "abstract": "This book addresses development laws for axial strain and excess pore water pressure in silty clay around subway shield tunnels before and after freezing-thawing when subjected to subway loading, as well as the effect of freezing-thawing on the dynamic parameters of silty clay, including the dynamic modulus and damping ratio, introducing readers to the design and construction of bypasses in subway tunnels with the artificial freezing method. On this basis, it then studies the microstructures of silty clay before and after freezing-thawing cyclic loading by means of scanning electron microscope tests and mercury intrusion porosimetry tests. Lastly, the book presents a numerical simulation of the dynamics of silty clay around subway tunnels before and after thawing. Given its scope, it offers a valuable reference guide for construction researchers and designers alike, as well as senior undergraduate and graduate students at colleges and universities.",

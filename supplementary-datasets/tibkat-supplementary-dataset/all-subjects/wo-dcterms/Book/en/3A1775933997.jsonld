This thought process can be applied to other areas within their facility to mitigate or eliminate any future reoccurrence. Lubrication Degradation: Getting into the Root Causes strives to break down the complex topic of Lubrication Degradation into its six most common failure mechanisms. It presents the mechanisms as manageable components and then teaches the reader how to identify the typical root causes associated with each failure mechanism. The book offers a field-proven and practical root cause analysis approach and discusses a proven thought process for getting to the root causes of each of the degradation mechanisms. The same thought process can be applied to other areas within the same facility, allowing the failure to be identified and appropriate actions taken to mitigate or eliminate any future reoccurrence. An ideal practical book for industry professionals involved with Plant Operations, Engineering, Management, Maintenance, Reliability, and also useful to Technicians\"--",

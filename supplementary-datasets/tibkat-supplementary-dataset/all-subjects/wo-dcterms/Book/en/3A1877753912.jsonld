This reprint, which is a collection of current scientific works by international authors in the field of surface coating with welding technologies, presents the following:\u00b7 Analysis of the causes of wear of working surfaces of machine parts and equipment;\u00b7 Description of most materials used in world industry for surfacing and thermal spraying;\u00b7 Extensive discussion of all modern technologies of applying surface layers (from gas cladding, through plasma spraying, to laser cladding);\u00b7 Examples of technological conditions of surfacing and thermal spraying processes of parts of various types and shapes.The Editors of this Special Issue, titled \"Innovative Technologies and Materials for the Production of Mechanical, Thermal and Corrosion Wear-Resistant Surface Layers and Coatings\", recommend this reprint to students of materials engineering and welding engineers. Undoubtedly, its reprint should be in the handy library of everyone who professionally deals with welding, especially repair management",

                "This Handbook of Numerical Simulation of In-Flight Icing covers an array of methodologies and technologies on numerical simulation of in-flight icing and its applications. Comprised of contributions from internationally recognized experts from the Americas, Asia, and the EU, this authoritative, self-contained reference includes best practices and specification data spanning the gamut of simulation tools available internationally that can be used to speed up the certification of aircraft and make them safer to fly into known icing. The collection features nine sections concentrating on aircraft, rotorcraft, jet engines, UAVs; ice protection systems, including hot-air, electrothermal, and others; sensors and probes, CFD in the aid of testing, flight simulators, and certification process acceleration methods. Incorporating perspectives from academia, commercial, government R&D, the book is ideal for a range of engineers and scientists concerned with in-flight icing applications. ."

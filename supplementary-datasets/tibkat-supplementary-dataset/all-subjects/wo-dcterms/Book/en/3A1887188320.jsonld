            "abstract": "The text is a European adaptation of our current US book: Strategic Market Management, 9th Edition by David Aaker. This new edition is a mainstream text suitable for all business students studying strategy and marketing courses. Strategic Market Management: Global Perspectives is motivated by the strategic challenges created by the dynamic nature of markets. The premise is that all traditional strategic management tools either do not apply or need to be adapted to a more dynamic context. The unique aspects of the book are its inclusion of: A business strategy definition that includes product/market scope, value proposition, and assets and competences. A structured strategic analysis including a detailed customer, competitor, market, and environmental analysis leading to understanding of market dynamics that is supported by a summary flow diagram, a set of agendas to help start the process, and a set of planning forms. Concepts of strategic commitment, opportunism, and adaptability and how they can and should be blended together. Bases of a value proposition and strong brands. A strategy without a compelling value proposition will not be market driven or successful. Brand assets that will support a business strategy need to be developed. Creating synergetic marketing with silo organisations defined by products or countries. All organisations have multiple products and markets and creating cooperation and communication instead of competition and isolation is becoming an imperative. A global perspective is an essential aspect of this new edition. This reflects the lived experience of the student reader but also their likely professional challenges. This is achieved by the extensive use of new examples and vignettes",

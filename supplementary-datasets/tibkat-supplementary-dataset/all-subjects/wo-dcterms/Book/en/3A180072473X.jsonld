            "abstract": "Combines qualitative fieldwork with analytic philosophy to provide guidelines for when it is right to help refugees repatriateEvery year, millions of people flee their countries to seek asylum abroad. When they arrive, many are forced into enclosed camps or denied residency rights. Some try to repatriate home, preferring the risks of returning to a life without freedom. Mollie Gerver considers when bodies such as the UN, government agencies and NGOs ought to help refugees to return home. Drawing on original interviews with 172 refugees before and after repatriation, she resolves seven moral puzzles arising from repatriation.Key FeaturesProvides a global analysis, including repatriating refugees from Iran to Iraq, Pakistan to Afghanistan, and Germany to BosniaDraws on interviews with 172 refugees and migrants before and after their repatriation from Israel to South Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, and other countries of originAsks new questions in the field in immigration ethics, focusing on the moral permissibility of assisting with repatriationProvides aid workers and policymakers with the tools to formulate more ethical repatriation policies",

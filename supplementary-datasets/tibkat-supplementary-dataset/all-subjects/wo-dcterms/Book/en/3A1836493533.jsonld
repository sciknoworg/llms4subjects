            "abstract": "\"The air is an important but largely unrecognized source of contaminant fate in the environment, including transport of pesticides and contaminants to nontarget areas and exposures for people and wildlife. This book summarizes and places in perspective the potential transport, transformation, and health implications of pesticides and contaminants in air, including the air we breathe. It delves into the hypothesis that the atmosphere is the most significant environmental compartment affecting the overall transport and fate of many classes of environmental contaminants.   The authors draw parallels between sampling, analysis, and impact of airborne toxics and particulate matter with the COVID-19 pandemic. Airborne viruses and fine particulate matter, which are of similar size, have remarkable parallels in how they are transmitted and accumulated in the respiratory tract.   FEATURES     Assesses exposures of people and wildlife to airborne chemicals    Includes case study applications, with relevant data summarized for pesticides and contaminants in air    Discusses approaches to modeling pesticides\u2019 and contaminants\u2019 dispersion and fate in air    Includes an assessment of the physicochemical properties of pesticides and contaminants that influence sampling and atmospheric mobility and fate    The authors are global experts in air contaminant research, and this book is well organized and helpful for people interested in regulatory, health, and other topics related to pesticides and contaminants in air.

Cahill is an Associate Professor in the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences at Arizona State University.\"",

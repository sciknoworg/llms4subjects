                "This book re-assesses the societal and pastoral roles of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in order to consider the function that they have in engaging, or responding, to the Vulnerability Agenda. HEIs are increasingly focusing on the inclusion of socially deprived individuals on programmes, as well as disability assessments, mental health concerns, learning support plans, and readiness for employment. Particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, universities are being profoundly affected and transformed as steps are taken to modify existing approaches to teaching and learning. Universities have always had an implicit \u2018duty of care\u2019 for their stakeholders, but COVID-19 has brought into sharp focus the need for a more explicit demonstration that University leaders have the social awareness to recognize the importance of protecting and safeguarding the vulnerable in society. Arguing that HEIs have a significant role to play as a central \u2018anchor\u2019 agency in the safeguarding of vulnerable individuals, this book fills in gaps in theoretical, empirical and policy/practice understandings. It explores the changing civic and societal (pastoral) role that HEIs have developed in response to the increasingly important policy area surrounding vulnerability. Joyce Liddle is Professor of Public Leadership and Enterprise at Newcastle Business School, Northumbria University, UK. Over the course of her career she has published over 200 articles, 25 book chapters and 14 books.

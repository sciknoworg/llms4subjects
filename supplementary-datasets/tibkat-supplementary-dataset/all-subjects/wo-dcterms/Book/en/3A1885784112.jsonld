            "abstract": "Sergii Bulgakov (1871\u20131944) is one of the preeminent theologians of the 20th century whose work is still being discovered and explored in and for the 21st century. The famous rival of Lenin in the field of economics, was, according to Wassily Kandinsky, \u201cone of the deepest experts on religious life\u201d in early twentieth-century Russian art and culture. As economist, publicist, politician, and later Orthodox theologian and priest, he became a significant \u201cglobal player\u201d in both the Orthodox diaspora and the Ecumenical movement in the interwar period. This anthology gathers the papers delivered at the international conference on the occasion of Bulgakov\u2019s 150th birthday at the University of Fribourg in September 2021. The chapters, written by established Bulgakov specialists, including Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury (2002\u20132012), as well as young researchers from different theological disciplines and ecclesial traditions, explore Bulgakov\u2019s way of meeting the challenges in the modern world and of building bridges between East and West. The authors bring forth a wide range of new creative ways to constructively engage with Bulgakov\u2019s theological worldview and cover topics such as personhood, ecology, political theology and Trinitarian ontology",

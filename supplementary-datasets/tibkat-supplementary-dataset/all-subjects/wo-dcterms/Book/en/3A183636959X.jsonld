            "abstract": "he work of L.O. Aranye Fradenburg, especially her psychoanalytic criticism of Chaucer, and her formulations of discontinuist historical approaches to the Middle Ages, has been extremely influential within medieval studies for the past 20 or so years. More recently she has been focusing on more broad defenses of the humanities, especially with regard to the valuable role of literary studies relative to the arts of everyday living, eudaimonia [flourishing], ethical community, and well-being, and also on psychoanalysis itself as a \u201cliberal art.\u201d Relationality, intersubjectivity, aliveness, resilience, care of the self and also of others, adaptive flexibility, playfulness, shared attention, companionship, healing, and thriving seem, increasingly, to be the key watchwords and concerns of Fradenburg\u2019s work, and at the same time, the so-called \u201cliterary\u201d mode is still central to these concerns, such that, as Fradenburg has written, \u201cInterpretation and relationality depend on one another because all relationships are unending processes of interpretation and expression, listening and signifying. In turn, sentience assists relationality: we can\u2019t thrive and probably can\u2019t survive without minds open to possibility, capable of sensing and interpreting the tiniest shifts in, e.g., pitch and tone.\u201d  This small volume features short essays and personal reflections on the importance of Fradenburg\u2019s career, as teacher and scholar, and also on the valuable role(s) that her work, and medieval studies more generally, has played and might still play in the defense of the humanities as essential to living and thriving",

                "This book gives a detailed information of various real-life applications from various fields using nature inspired optimization techniques. These techniques are proven to be efficient and robust in many difficult problems in literature. The authors provide detailed information about real-life problems and how various nature inspired optimizations are applied to solve these problems. The authors discuss techniques such as Biogeography Based Optimization, Glow Swarm Optimization, Elephant herd Optimization Algorithm, Cuckoo Search Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization, and Grey Wolf Optimization etc. These algorithms are applied to a wide range of problems from the field of engineering, finance, medicinal etc. As an important part of the Women in Science and Engineering book series, the work highlights the contribution of women leaders in nature inspired optimization, inspiring women and men, girls and boys to enter and apply themselves to the field. Provides a detailed overview of nature inspired optimization techniques from prominent women in the field; Presents well-defined variables and objective functions and their constraints of various real-life problems in nature inspired optimization; Includes methodology and criteria for presentation of the solutions obtained."

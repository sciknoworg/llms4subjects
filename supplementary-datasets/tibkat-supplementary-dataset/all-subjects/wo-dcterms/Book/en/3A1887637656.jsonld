                "This book constitutes the proceedings of the Third International Conference on Smart Grid and Innovative Frontiers in Telecommunications, SmartGIFT, held in Auckland, New Zealand, in April 2018. The 28 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from 44 submissions. They focus on smart grid as the next generation of electrical grid, which will enable the smart integration of conventional, renewable and distributed power generation, energy storage, transmission and distribution, and demand management. The benefits of smart grid include enhanced reliability and resilience, higher intelligence and optimized control, decentralized operation, higher operational efficiency, more efficient demand management, and better power quality",

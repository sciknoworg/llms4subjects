            "abstract": "\"The book is a research monograph. An asymptotically exact solution of the many-body scattering problem is given under the assumption a, where a is the characteristic size of a small particle, d is the smallest distance between particles and is the wavelength in the medium in which the particles are embedded. Scattering of scalar and electromagnetic waves is considered. Heat transfer theory in the medium in which many small bodies are embedded is developed. Quantum-mechanical theory of scattering by many potentials with small support is constructed. On the basis of these theoretical results, important applications are presented. First, a method for creating materials with a desired refraction coefficient is given. Secondly, a method for creating wave-focusing materials is developed. Technological problems to be solved for practical usage of these applied results are discussed. This book contains the contents of the author's earlier monograph, published in 2013. New appendices, based on the author's review papers published after 2013, are added\"--",

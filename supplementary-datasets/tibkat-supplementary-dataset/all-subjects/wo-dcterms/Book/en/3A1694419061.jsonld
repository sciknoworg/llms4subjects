            "abstract": "There are three types of teacherpreneurs: classroom, business, and consultant teacherpreneurs. Classroom teacherpreneurs inspire and motivate students to be the best they can be using outside resources, business teacherpreneurs teach students to become entrepreneurs, and consultant teacherpreneurs are usually former teachers who own a consulting business and go into schools to assist with improving academics. Each plays an important and different role within the educational system in the United States and one without the other would not assist students in gaining academic success. These individuals are the mainstay of educational systems, and without them, school systems would fail. Enhancing Teaching and Leadership Initiatives With Teacherpreneurs: Emerging Research and Opportunities is a critical scholarly resource that explores the characteristics and models of a teacherpreneur, their advantages and disadvantages, and examines how they can be used by current classroom teachers and school administrators to improve and enhance the teaching profession. Featuring a wide range of topics such as curriculum design, student outcomes, and ethics, this book is essential for teachers, educational consultants, school administrators, academicians, researchers, and students",

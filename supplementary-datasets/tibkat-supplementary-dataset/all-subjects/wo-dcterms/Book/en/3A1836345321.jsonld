            "abstract": "The overwhelming majority of tea practitioners in contemporary Japan are women, but there has been little discussion on their historical role in tea culture (<i>chanoyu</i>). In <i>Cultivating Femininity,</i> Rebecca Corbett writes women back into this history and shows how tea practice for women was understood, articulated, and promoted in the Edo (1603\u20131868) and Meiji (1868\u20131912) periods. Viewing <i>chanoyu</i> from the lens of feminist and gender theory, she sheds new light on tea\u2019s undeniable influence on the formation of modern understandings of femininity in Japan. <i>Cultivating Femininity </i>offers a new perspective on the prevalence of tea practice among women in modern Japan. It presents a fresh, much-needed approach, one that will be appreciated by students and scholars of Japanese history, gender, and culture, as well as by tea practitioners",

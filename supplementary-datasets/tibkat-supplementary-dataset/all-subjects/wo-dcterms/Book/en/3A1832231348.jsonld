            "title": "Cooperative Radio Communications for Green Smart Environments",
            "abstract": "The demand for mobile connectivity is continuously increasing, and by 2020 Mobile and Wireless Communications will serve not only very dense populations of mobile phones and nomadic computers, but also the expected multiplicity of devices and sensors located in machines, vehicles, health systems and city infrastructures. Future Mobile Networks are then faced with many new scenarios and use cases, which will load the networks with different data traffic patterns, in new or shared spectrum bands, creating new specific requirements. This book addresses both the techniques to model, analyse and optimise the radio links and transmission systems in such scenarios, together with the most advanced radio access, resource management and mobile networking technologies. This text summarises the work performed by more than 500 researchers from more than 120 institutions in Europe, America and Asia, from both academia and industries, within the framework of the COST IC1004 Action on \"Cooperative Radio Communications for Green and Smart Environments\". The book will have appeal to graduates and researchers in the Radio Communications area, and also to engineers working in the Wireless industry. Topics discussed in this book include: \u2022 Radio waves propagation phenomena in diverse urban, indoor, vehicular and body environments\u2022 Measurements, characterization, and modelling of radio channels beyond 4G networks\u2022 Key issues in Vehicle (V2X) communication\u2022 Wireless Body Area Networks, including specific Radio Channel Models for WBANs\u2022 Energy efficiency and resource management enhancements in Radio Access Networks\u2022 Definitions and models for the virtualised and cloud RAN architectures\u2022 Advances on feasible indoor localization and tracking techniques\u2022 Recent findings and innovations in antenna systems for communications\u2022 Physical Layer Network Coding for next generation wireless systems\u2022 Methods and techniques for MIMO Over the Air (OTA) testing",

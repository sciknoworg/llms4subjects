            "abstract": "\"In the post-COVID era, understanding the profound impact of digital technologies on design pedagogy is crucial. This book delves into experimental design education, showcasing projects utilising technology to transform creative and analytical processes. Emphasising the potential for digital-era technologies to create novel educational opportunities, the book addresses recent global events and their role in minimising educational disruptions in the evolving hybrid educational landscape. Each chapter offers case studies exploring digital technology's influence across architectural education, spanning interior design, urban planning, parametric digital design, architectural conservation, and design analysis. Contributors envision the hybrid virtual design studio's future and discuss the collaborative role of digital technologies in urban design projects. The book analyses contemporary parametric design processes and machine learning through innovative historical case studies, examining new technologies in architectural conservation. With case studies from diverse locations, including South Africa, Turkey, the UK, and the United States, the book provides a global perspective on the influences and potential futures of digital technologies in architecture. Essential for those interested in the future of spatial design education, this book illuminates the pivotal role of technology in shaping its trajectory\"--",

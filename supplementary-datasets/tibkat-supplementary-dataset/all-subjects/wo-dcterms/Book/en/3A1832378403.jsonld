            "abstract": "Biomedicine is a multidisciplinary branch of medical science that consists of many scientific disciplines, e.g., biology, biotechnology, bioinformatics, and genetics; moreover, it covers various medical specialties. In recent years, this field of science has developed rapidly. This means that a large amount of data has been generated, due to (among other reasons) the processing, analysis, and recognition of a wide range of biomedical signals and images obtained through increasingly advanced medical imaging devices. The analysis of these data requires the use of advanced IT methods, which include those related to the use of artificial intelligence, and in particular machine learning. It is a summary of the Special Issue \"Machine Learning for Biomedical Application\", briefly outlining selected applications of machine learning in the processing, analysis, and recognition of biomedical data, mostly regarding biosignals and medical images",

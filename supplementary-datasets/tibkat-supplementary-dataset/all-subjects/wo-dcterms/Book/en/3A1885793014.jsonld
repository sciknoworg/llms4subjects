            "abstract": "The monograph reflects and scientifically and methodologically substantiates ways to solve urgent problems of the theory and practice of training officers of the National Police in terms of the quality of higher education in the context of the imperative of human-dimensional meanings, taking into account studies of Ukrainian psychological, pedagogical, legal comparative studies. In the most general form, the material is presented regarding the strategic guidelines for the quality of education in the WHE with special learning conditions in the context of Ukraine's integration into the European educational space. Philosophical and methodological approaches to solving existing disagreements in the field of human measurement of the quality of police education in Ukraine and abroad are studied in integral connection with the corresponding concepts of human development; leadership theories; the genesis of personnel work on professional training and evaluation of the activities of police officers in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Features of the human-measurement training of officers of the National Police of Ukraine are explained on the basis of the provisions of the modern post-non-classical methodology of science, a general scientific holistic approach, humanistic pedagogy, as well as the methodological foundations for the implementation of international standards of ethical behavior in the activities of police officers, which is an objective need of the current Ukrainian education system in general and in particular, a prerequisite for the prevention of corruption offenses, the vitality of virtue in society. The productivity of reflexive practices of self-organization of the personality of future police officers is substantiated as a condition for the development of psychological resilience.  The book proves the necessity and prospects of research and implementation in the theory and practice of police education of the concept of Ukrainian general scientific methodology regarding the unity of the formation and development of a Human on the basis of the cognitive-emotional-volitional triad of components of the value experience of the individual. Based on the real originality of the formation of the value experience of a police officer in the process of professional training, constructive practice, the general theoretical and methodological origins and meaningful lines of practical improvement and further personal and professional growth of a police officer in their official activities as mechanisms for protecting human rights and freedoms in the activities of law enforcement officers are identified.  The novelty of the approaches is associated with the use of the key foundations of psycho-pedagogical support and the development of pedagogical skills of HEI teachers with special learning conditions, the activities of mentors to harmonize the professional training of the applicant's personality in the system of departmental education, the use of a criteria approach for assessing learning outcomes, the design features of police work programs in the context of the scale of human-dimensional meanings evaluating the quality of higher education The constructiveness of this perspective is distinguished, first of all, by a holistic combination and use as the latest achievements of the psychological, pedagogical, legal, neurophysiological branches of scientific knowledge to explain the newly formed pedagogical phenomena of the modern educational sphere in the aspect of innovativeness of markers for assessing the quality of educational and research activities education; and the understanding that universal human and nation-creating value orientations as a special social basis of the culturological worldview should be extrapolated into the global function of modern education, which should determine and realize its social power that characterizes civilizational development in different historical epochs. In this context, the issues of introducing the axiological essence, designing, implementing and evaluating the relevant educational programs for training officers of the National Police are specified.  In general, the developments contained in this collective monograph will be suitable for use in the pedagogical and psychological support of educational activities for the training of police officers both in the framework of formal and non-formal education",

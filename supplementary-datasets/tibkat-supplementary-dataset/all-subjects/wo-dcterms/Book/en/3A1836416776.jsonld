            "abstract": "In 1979 Tajima and Dawson, Tajima & Dawson (1979), on the basis of theoretical work and simulations, have shown that relativistic plasma waves are suitable for the development of  compact accelerators. In the proposed schemes, electrons were injected externally and were  accelerated through the very high electric field (GV/m) sustained by relativistic plasma waves  driven by lasers, in the laser beatwave regime or in the laser wakefield regime. Several  experiments have been performed following their idea and injected electrons at the few  MeV level have indeed been accelerated by electric fields in the GV/m range in a plasma  medium using the beat wave and laser wakefield schemes. With the development of more  powerful lasers, much higher electric fields were achieved, from few GV/m to more than 1  TV/m, Malka et al. (2002)",

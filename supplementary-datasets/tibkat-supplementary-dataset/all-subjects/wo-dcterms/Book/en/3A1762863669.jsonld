            "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging research field that is rapidly becoming an important part of our everyday lives including home automation, smart buildings, smart things, and more. This is due to cheap, efficient, and wirelessly-enabled circuit boards that are enabling the functions of remote sensing/actuating, decentralization, autonomy, and other essential functions. Moreover, with the advancements in embedded artificial intelligence, these devices are becoming more self-aware and autonomous, hence making decisions themselves. Current research is devoted to the understanding of how decision support systems are integrated into industrial IoT.Decision Support Systems and Industrial IoT in Smart Grid, Factories, and Cities presents the internet of things and its place during the technological revolution, which is taking place now to bring us a better, sustainable, automated, and safer world. This book also covers the challenges being faced such as relations and implications of IoT with existing communication and networking technologies; applications like practical use-case scenarios from the real world including smart cities, buildings, and grids; and topics such as cyber security, user privacy, data ownership, and information handling related to IoT networks. Additionally, this book focuses on the future applications, trends, and potential benefits of this new discipline. This book is essential for electrical engineers, computer engineers, researchers in IoT, security, and smart cities, along with practitioners, researchers, academicians, and students interested in all aspects of industrial IoT and its applications",

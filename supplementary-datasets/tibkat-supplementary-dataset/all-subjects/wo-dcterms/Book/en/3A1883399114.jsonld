            "abstract": "This volume is woven around the applications of different spectroscopic techniques in the quality analysis of food stuff. Wide range of food items including fruits, fruit juices and edible oils have been covered. Different molecular and atomic spectroscopy techniques including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) and mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy and Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy have been discussed in detail for such quality analysis applications. Bottom-up approach has been used in most of the chapters. Individual chapters have been written by experts from different disciplines/laboratories and hence interdisciplinary character has emerged in a natural way. Mathematical details have been kept at a level necessary minimum so as to suit a wider range of audience including novice researchers. Part of IOP Series in Spectroscopic Methods and Applications.",

                "This open access book thoroughly investigates the domain of policy design tailored specifically for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with a central emphasis on harmonizing these policies with the preexisting social capital inherent to these enterprises, consistent with the mandate of Bank Indonesia to guard price stability and to promote financial stability, inclusive, and sustainable growth. \u201cProfessor Iwan Jaya Azis has made yet another substantial and original contribution to the literature on economic development \u2026 This study, on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), is a continuation of his life-long professional career, to focus on key development and policy issues. \u2026 advocates an approach to listen, that is, to talk to the actors in a variety of economic and ecological settings, and to design policies accordingly. All too often, this seemingly obvious methodology has been ignored in favor of a top-down approach.\u201d (Hal Hill, H.W. Arndt Professor Emeritus of the Southeast Asian Economies, Crawford School, Australian National University) \u201cIwan Azis\u2019s \"Listen and Design\" is another great new book of his \u2026 building on its predecessor \"Periphery and Small Ones Matter\", it shows that the success of policy programs requires understanding the prevailing social capital \u2026 To do this requires listening to MSMEs so as to \"align the preferences of enterprises and policy makers.\" \u2026 This is the third, great contribution of Iwan Azis book for all development economists and policy makers.\u201d (Ludger Schuknecht, Former German Federal Ministry of Finance, ex-OECD Deputy Secretary-General, and currently Vice President and Corporate Secretary of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)) \u201cThe role of micro, small, and medium enterprises is crucial in contributing to the development process. Early in the structural transformation, these enterprises are in the informal sector and gradually move into the formal sector as they learn more efficient business practices. The important contribution of this book is that it successfully searches for policies that can speed up this process and make these enterprises more efficient and productive. The methodology used by the author is original. \u2026 This book deserves to be read by researchers and policymakers interested in micro enterprises.\u201d (Erik Thorbecke, H.E. Babcock Professor of Economics (Emeritus), Cornell University) \u201cThere have been many analyses and studies on MSMEs, but Iwan Azis\u2019 book tops them all in terms of evidence base, innovative approach with the AHP and ANP methodology something the author has worked for decades, and most of all written with the heart by recognizing that people are at the center of development and the importance of social capital \u2026 This is an incredible reference for all stakeholders from governments, networks of MSMEs, facilitators, and all those who care about people and community centered development.\u201d (Mari E Pangestu, Former Trade Minister of Indonesia and Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships, World Bank).",

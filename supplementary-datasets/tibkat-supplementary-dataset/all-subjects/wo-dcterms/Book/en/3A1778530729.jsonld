            "abstract": "This book is dedicated toward space technology application in Earth studies based on the use of a variety of methods for satellite information classification and interpretation. Advantages of geospatial data use in a large-scale area of observation and monitoring as a source of decision-making stage have been demonstrated. The book describes navigation systems providing data estimation method and review of existing data in the literature relevant to remote sensing sensors delivering main information electromagnetic spectrum and a variety of sensor applications. This aspect is important when combining/integrating satellite data processing into the field measurements. Satellites and satellite data application for the study of Earth features have been demonstrated as the next step of geospatial data application. The use of different purposeful processing technology applications of satellite data is one of the vital aspects of space technology advances. The use of GNSS GPS technology in industry and MODIS images and data interpretation for agriculture purposes has been presented. It was the aim of the book to create an attractive environment by presenting space technology application in the wide areas of Earth study. For this purpose, some of the book chapters are dedicated toward space technology advances in climate monitoring, natural disaster factor detection, satellite data processing optimization, and GIS technology for meteorology information with the aim of agriculture developments",

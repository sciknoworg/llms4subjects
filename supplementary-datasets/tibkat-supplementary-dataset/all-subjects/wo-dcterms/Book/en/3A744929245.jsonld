                "The main objectives of the Ccmnunity's energy policy consist of securing a sufficient energy supply for the present and future demand of its Member States and in reducing the Community's dependence on imported energy through the more rational use of energy and a broader diversifi\u00ad cation of supply. This requires a full set of common efforts at all levels, including energy research and development. In the framework of its strategy for scientific and technological research the Commission of the European Ccmnunities has launched several R & D progranunes in the field of energy. Theses progranunes are :inplemented either directly in its Joint Research Centre or by concluding contracts with research institutions in the EC Member countries. One of the most inportant short and medil.UR term objectives of the present four-year Energy R & D Progranune (1979 - 1983) approved by the Council of Ministers on 13 September 1979 aims at fostering energy conservation technologies in the three main energy consl.Uning sectors: danestic, industry and transport. In the European Carmunity more than 35% of the energy is conslB'IIed in industry. About 23% of the inported oil is used in this sector. Two thirds of this energy are used for heating purposes. Consequently, there is a high potential for residuary heat recovery. In order to enhance rational use of energy and energy conservation in the Member States of the Ccmnunity, it is necessary, anong other things, to promote the development of combustion and energy recovery techniques.",

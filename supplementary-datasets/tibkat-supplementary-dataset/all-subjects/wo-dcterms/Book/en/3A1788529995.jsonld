                "This book examines archaeometallurgy and the preservation of ancient materials for cultural heritage. Through understanding the internal structures of relevant ancient materials, their chemical composition, resistance, hardness, etc., their conservation can be more effectively addressed. Preserving cultural artifacts, such as those from border sites, funerary contexts (burials), railway lines, ceremonial sites and road infrastructure, is necessary to provide perspective to a culture\u2019s trajectory. This book addresses how Reverse Engineering can disseminate knowledge of a culture\u2019s heritage by offering technology that can help restore artifacts so they may be displayed and utilized as educational objects. Discusses how reverse engineering can be used in the preservation of cultural heritage Covers preservation and reconstruction methods for ancient materials Provides a useful resource on archaeometallurgy for everyone from museum curators to field researchers on material science and academic teachers."

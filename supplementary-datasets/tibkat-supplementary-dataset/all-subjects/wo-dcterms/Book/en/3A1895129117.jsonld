                "Generic motion components for sonic design -- Sound design and the theory of self-augmented interactions -- Musical meter as shape: An embodied perspective on metrical trajectories and curves -- Prelude to a theory of gestural time, proto-geometry, and music -- A grammar of expressive conducting gestures.",
                "This open access book offers a historical context and an overview of the field's current artistic and scientific research. Sonic design includes the construction and performance of acoustic instruments but also recording, editing, mixing, and synthesizing sounds using analog and digital electronic devices. This book explores sonic design from the perspectives of music theory, music perception, embodied cognition, phenomenology, soundscape studies, acoustics, new interfaces for musical expression, sound and music computing, and music information retrieval. The chapters are selected contributions from an international seminar organized to celebrate the achievements of Professor Rolf Inge God\u00f8y at the University of Oslo. As a composer, researcher, teacher, and supervisor, Professor God\u00f8y has been central in developing a holistic approach to sonic design, from theory to practice. This book offers a comprehensive overview of the field's current state, making it essential reading for students, practitioners, and researchers across a wide range of disciplines. ."

            "abstract": "\"Traditional organizational structures and cultures are no longer fit for purpose in a digitally-empowered world. The number of new and disruptive technologies is increasing, the speed of change shows no sign of slowing down and organization development practitioners and business leaders need to act urgently to enable their companies to succeed in the digital age. Agile Transformation is the much-needed guide on how to achieve this success. Packed full of practical advice, this book covers everything from why new operating models are needed, how to apply agile principles at scale, leverage digital-native processes and why change managers need to think big but start small. Agile Transformation also covers how to build and engage high performing teams for change, how to tackle the employee mindset that can hinder agile adoption and why developing an agile business is not an excuse to fail to plan. There is also guidance on how to develop fast and focused high-velocity decision making, build momentum for change and apply an agile approach to different business functions including HR, Finance, Sales, Operations and Procurement. This book is crucial reading for all businesses wanting to effectively compete in the new world of work\"--",

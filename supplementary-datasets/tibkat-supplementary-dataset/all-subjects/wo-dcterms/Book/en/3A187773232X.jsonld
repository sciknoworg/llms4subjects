            "title": "Advances in Ebola Control",
            "abstract": "Ebola epidemics have had immediate and lasting impact in Africa and beyond, with its high case fatality and societal disruption. Its rapid spread, coupled with the limited knowledge, serves as a recipe for disaster and panic in the community. Health workers are particularly at risk, paying heavily with their lives. Sharing knowledge from various experts in basic sciences that support vaccine and drug development, as well as improving community surveillance and case management, enriches our understanding of this highly fatal and contagious disease. In a world that is fast becoming a global village, communicable diseases from low-resource setting are gradually becoming a global health threat. This book seeks to discuss emerging advances in the Ebola control",

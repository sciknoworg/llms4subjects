                "\"This book presents cloud computing, using a series of practical and fun examples. It provides comprehensive coverage of Windows Azure cloud platform, the theories behind cloud computing, as well as guidance and best practices in designing cloud-based applications. It can serve as a reference for cloud system developers, architects, and IT professionals. It is also suitable for use in instructional settings\"--",
                "\"Foreword This book by Haishi Bai provides a detailed introduction to cloud computing, in general, and to Windows Azure, in particular. Haishi Bai has had an extensive and successful career in information systems, which brought him from the Northeast of China to Beijing and then finally to Silicon Valley and to the Microsoft Head Office in Redmond as a Windows Azure evangelist. His experience studying the rise and fall of e-business, boom of social networks, and rise of cloud computing provides him a deep understanding of the pros and cons in cloud computing. This book explains the various concepts of Azure in a logical and clear manner. It is divided into four sections: cloud service fundamentals, cloud service design, cloud and devices, and system integration and project management. Beginners can use this book as a guide in their journey through cloud computing. Experienced cloud developers can benefit from it by studying specific scenarios. The book consists of 70 complete end-to-end examples that provide step-bystep guidance on implementing typical cloud-based scenarios. The examples cover a wide range of application types and technologies with different levels of difficulties. The book also provides practical knowledge and tips and tricks that you can apply to your own work. This book should provide invaluable help to IT managers who want to stay up to date, developers who want to implement applications using Windows Azure, as well as system engineers who are looking to gain in-depth knowledge on cloud computing. Enjoy the reading as I did and looking forward to your great contributions to this new world! Pierre Masai CIO of Toyota Motor Europe\"--"

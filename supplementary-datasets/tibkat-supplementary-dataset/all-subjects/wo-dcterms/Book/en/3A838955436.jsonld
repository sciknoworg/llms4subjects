                "Essential Oils in Food Preservation, Flavor and Safetydiscusses the major advances in the understanding of the Essential Oils and their application, providing a resource that takes into account the fact that there is little attention paid to the scientific basis or toxicity of these oils. This book provides an authoritative synopsis of many of the complex features of the essential oils as applied to food science, ranging from production and harvesting, to the anti-spoilage properties of individual components. It embraces a holistic approach to the topic, and is divided into two distinct parts, the general aspects and named essential oils.With more than 100 chapters in parts two and three, users will find valuable sections on botanical aspects, usage and applications, and a section on applications in food science that emphasizes the fact that essential oils are frequently used to impart flavor and aroma. However, more recently, their use as anti-spoilage agents has been extensively researched.Explains how essential oils can be used to improve safety, flavor, and functionEmbraces a holistic approach to the topic, and is divided into two distinct parts, the general aspects and named essential oilsProvides exceptional range of information, from general use insights to specific use and application information, along with geographically specific informationExamines traditional and evidence-based usesIncludes methods and examples of investigation and application"

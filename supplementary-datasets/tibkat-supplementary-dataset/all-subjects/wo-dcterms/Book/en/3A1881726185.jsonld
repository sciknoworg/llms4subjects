            "abstract": "The Armenia public sector accountability survey is instrumental in addressing the disparities between de jure laws and regulations and de facto practices and seeks to fill existing knowledge gaps and inform further definition and implementation of the government's anticorruption initiatives. The survey was implemented by the Corruption Prevention Commission (CPC) and the World Bank. It aimed to: (i) provide a comprehensive assessment of the patterns and determinants of integrity risks, and how they can impact productivity and performance in the public administration in Armenia; (ii) understand the perceptions of Armenian public servants regarding ongoing anticorruption initiatives, their awareness of integrity risks, and the needs for further interventions; and (iii) generate evidence, support and inform further definition of reforms and anticorruption initiatives that help address and counter weak integrity practices in the public sector in Armenia. By highlighting the disparities between de jure laws and de facto practices, particularly in terms of integrity within the public sector, this survey aimed to serve as a cornerstone for informing effective implementation in targeted interventions and bridging the gap between policy intentions and actual practices within Armenia's governance. The Armenia public sector accountability survey was aimed at public servants in selected public entities in Armenia, including central ministries and agencies, regional governments, and selected municipalities across the country. The analysis of the survey findings is anchored in the government production function conceptual framework and adjusted to explicitly take into account the drivers and consequences of corruption",

            "abstract": "This book is a translation from Russian of Part III of the book Mathematics via Problems: From Olympiads and Math Circles to Profession. Part I, Algebra, and Part II, Geometry, have been published in the same series. The main goal of this book is to develop important parts of mathematics through problems. The authors tried to put together sequences of problems that allow high school students (and some undergraduates) with strong interest in mathematics to discover such topics in combinatorics as counting, graphs, constructions and invariants in combinatorics, games and algorithms, probabilistic aspects of combinatorics, and combinatorial geometry. Definitions and/or references for material that is not standard in the school curriculum are included. To help students that might be unfamiliar with new material, problems are carefully arranged to provide gradual introduction into each subject. Problems are often accompanied by hints and/or complete solutions. The book is based on classes taught by the authors at different times at the Independent University of Moscow, at a number of Moscow schools and math circles, and at various summer schools. It can be used by high school students and undergraduates, their teachers, and organizers of summer camps and math circles. In the interest of fostering a greater awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life, SLMath (formerly MSRI) and the AMS are publishing books in the Mathematical Circles Library series as a service to young people, their parents and teachers, and the mathematics profession.",

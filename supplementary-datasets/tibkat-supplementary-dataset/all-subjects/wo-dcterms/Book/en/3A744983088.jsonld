            "abstract": "There have been frequent, extensive efforts made over recent decades to develop and manage water resource systems to meet multiple purposes and objectives, especially for large rivers. Control of the spatial and temporal distribution of water in those rivers in order to meet more effectively a variety of economic in-stream and off-stream purposes and uses and increased point and non-point pollutant loadings has often reduced the health of the rivers' aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and decreased the rivers' floodplain and wetland areas. The result has been a loss in ecosystem biodiversity and reduced self-purification capacities and an increase in the magnitude of the peak flows - and economic damage - accompanying major floods. This book focuses on the central issue of how best to design, manage and operate water control facilities so as to meet ecological and environmental as well as economic objectives - objectives that in some ways may be in conflict with one another. Numerous case examples are described, covering the restoration needs and activities taking place in river basins in Central Asia, Eastern and Western Europe and North America. Methods of organising, planning, financing, managing and negotiating agreements associated with river rehabilitation activities are also presented",

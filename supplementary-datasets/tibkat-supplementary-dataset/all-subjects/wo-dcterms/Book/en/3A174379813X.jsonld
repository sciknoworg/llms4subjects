                "This open access book provides an overview of the dissertations of the five nominees for the Ernst Denert Award for Software Engineering in 2019. The prize, kindly sponsored by the Gerlind & Ernst Denert Stiftung, is awarded for excellent work within the discipline of Software Engineering, which includes methods, tools and procedures for better and efficient development of high quality software. An essential requirement for the nominated work is its applicability and usability in industrial practice. The book contains five papers describing the works by Sebastian Baltes (U Trier) on Software Developers\u2019Work Habits and Expertise, Timo Greifenberg\u2019s thesis on Artefaktbasierte Analyse modellgetriebener Softwareentwicklungsprojekte, Marco Konersmann\u2019s (U Duisburg-Essen) work on Explicitly Integrated Architecture, Marija Selakovic\u2019s (TU Darmstadt) research about Actionable Program Analyses for Improving Software Performance, and Johannes Sp\u00e4th\u2019s (Paderborn U) thesis on Synchronized Pushdown Systems for Pointer and Data-Flow Analysis \u2013 which actually won the award. The chapters describe key findings of the respective works, show their relevance and applicability to practice and industrial software engineering projects, and provide additional information and findings that have only been discovered afterwards, e.g. when applying the results in industry. This way, the book is not only interesting to other researchers, but also to industrial software professionals who would like to learn about the application of state-of-the-art methods in their daily work.",

The topic of engineering fluid dynamics includes both experimental and computational studies. Of special interest were submissions from the fields of mechanical, chemical, marine, safety, and energy engineering. We welcomed original research articles and review articles. After one-and-a-half years, 59 papers were submitted and 31 were accepted for publication. The average processing time was about 41 days. The authors had the following geographical distribution: China (15); Korea (7); Japan (3); Norway (2); Sweden (2); Vietnam (2); Australia (1); Denmark (1); Germany (1); Mexico (1); Poland (1); Saudi Arabia (1); USA (1); Serbia (1). Papers covered a wide range of topics including analysis of free-surface waves, bridge girders, gear boxes, hills, radiation heat transfer, spillways, turbulent flames, pipe flow, open channels, jets, combustion chambers, welding, sprinkler, slug flow, turbines, thermoelectric power generation, airfoils, bed formation, fires in tunnels, shell-and-tube heat exchangers, and pumps",

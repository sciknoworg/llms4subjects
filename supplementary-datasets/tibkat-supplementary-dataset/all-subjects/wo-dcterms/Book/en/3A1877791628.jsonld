            "abstract": "Sorcery or Science? examines how two Sufi Muslim theologians who rose to prominence in the western Sahara Desert in the late eighteenth century, S\u012bdi al-Mukht\u0101r al-Kunt\u012b (d. 1811) and his son and successor, S\u012bdi Mu\u1e25ammad al-Kunt\u012b (d. 1826), decisively influenced the development of Sufi Muslim thought in West Africa.Known as the Kunta scholars, Mukht\u0101r al-Kunt\u012b and Mu\u1e25ammad al-Kunt\u012b were influential teachers who developed a pedagogical network of students across the Sahara. In exploring their understanding of \u201cthe realm of the unseen\"\u2014a vast, invisible world that is both surrounded and interpenetrated by the visible world\u2014Ariela Marcus-Sells reveals how these theologians developed a set of practices that depended on knowledge of this unseen world and that allowed practitioners to manipulate the visible and invisible realms. They called these practices \u201cthe sciences of the unseen.\" While they acknowledged that some Muslims\u2014particularly self-identified \u201cwhite\" Muslim elites\u2014might consider these practices to be \u201csorcery,\" the Kunta scholars argued that these were legitimate Islamic practices. Marcus-Sells situates their ideas and beliefs within the historical and cultural context of the Sahara Desert, surveying the cosmology and metaphysics of the realm of the unseen and the history of magical discourses within the Hellenistic and Arabo-Islamic worlds. Erudite and innovative, this volume connects the Islamic sciences of the unseen with the reception of Hellenistic discourses of magic and proposes a new methodology for reading written devotional aids in historical context. It will be welcomed by scholars of magic and specialists in Africana religious studies, Islamic occultism, and Islamic manuscript culture",

            "abstract": "Environmental pollution poses serious challenges for China, including to its economy as well as public health. The China Story Yearbook 2015: Pollution looks at how China\u2019s Communist Party-state addresses these problems and how Chinese citizens have coped with and expressed their concerns about living with chronic, worsening pollution. This Yearbook also explores the broader ramifications of pollution in the People\u2019s Republic for culture, society law and social activism, as well as the Internet, language, thought, and approaches to history. It looks at how it affects economic and political developments, urban change, and China\u2019s regional and global posture. The Chinese Communist Party, led by \u2018Chairman of Everything\u2019 Xi Jinping, meanwhile, has subjected mainland society to increasingly repressive control in its new determination to rid the country of Western \u2018spiritual pollutants\u2019 while achieving cultural purification through \u2018propaganda and ideological work\u2019. To adulterate, contaminate, spoil or violate\u2014these are among the metaphorical and literal connotations of pollution expressed in this Yearbook via the character ran \u67d3, which forms part of the word for pollution in Chinese, wuran \u6c61\u67d3. As the world increasingly relies on economic ties with China, the complexities of China\u2019s one-party system and the Chinese government\u2019s attitudes towards \u2018pollution\u2019 are of increasing global significance",

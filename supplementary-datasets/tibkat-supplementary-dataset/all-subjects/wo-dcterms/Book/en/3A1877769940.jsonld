            "abstract": "This paper takes a fresh look at Johannes Clauberg\u2019s Logica vetus et nova, in order to try to clarify its nature and character. Differently from prior readings of Clauberg that analyze his philosophy from the point of view of the construction of \u2018ontology\u2019, the approach of the present paper sees in Clauberg\u2019s philosophy a late-Humanist work, accentuating his pedagogic and hermeneutical interests. Indeed, in Clauberg\u2019s philosophy, hermeneutics and pedagogy are intrinsically bound together. This, the paper suggests, is supported not only by the concrete subject-matters of his logic, but also by the examination of Clauberg\u2019s milieu and of his sources. Analysis, in this framework, has a strictly hermeneutical usage",

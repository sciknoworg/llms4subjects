                "These Proceedings, consisting of Parts A and B, contain the edited versions of most of the papers presented at the annual Review of Progress in Quantitative Nondestructive Evaluation held at the University of Washington, Seattle on July 30 to August 4, 1995. The Review was organized by the Center for NDE at Iowa State University, in cooperation with the Ames Laboratory of the USDOE, the American Society of Nondestructive Testing, the Department of Energy, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Science Foundation IndustryiUniversity Cooperative Research Centers, and the Working Group in Quantitative NDE. This year's Review of Progress in QNDE was attended by approximately 450 participants from the US and many foreign countries who presented over 375 papers. The meeting was divided into 36 sessions with as many as four sessions running concurrently. The Review covered all phases of NDE research and development from fundamental investigations to engineering applications or inspection systems, and it included many important methods of inspection science from acoustics to x-rays. In the last several years, the Review has stabilized at about its current size. Most participants seem to agree it is large enough to permit a full-scale overview of the latest developments but still small enough to retain the collegial atmosphere which has marked the Review since its inception. The Proceedings are structured in a format to reflect the organization of the Review itself, producing a more logical organization for both the meeting and the present volume.",

                "\u201cThis courageous piece of work proposes a deep and comprehensive approach of an upmost problem of contemporary international politics at a pivotal moment of our history. An indispensable book for understanding the present state of the world.\u201d \u2013 Guy Mettan, journalist and author of Creating Russophobia \u201cThese days one needs a lot of intellectual and even personal courage to address the notion of Russophobia, which has become so common in the ongoing information war between Russia and the West. To Professor Diesen\u2019s credit, his book presents an academically rigorous and well documented attempt to analyze the origins, evolution and modern manifestations of this complex phenomenon.\u201d \u2013 Andrey Kortunov, Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council \u201cGlenn Diesen continues the tradition of studying Western presentations of Russia as the inferior and aggressive Other. He sheds important light on 'Us' versus 'Them' strategies exploited by Western political and media circles in cases of RussiaGate, Ukraine, and Syria.\u201d \u2013 Andrei P. Tsygankov, San Francisco State University \u201cAn incisive takedown of the neo-McCarthyite chauvinism that has consumed Western political culture, to the great detriment of honest journalism and global peace.\u201d \u2013 Aaron Mat\u00e9, journalist at the Grayzone and former producer of Democracy Now Propaganda is the science of convincing an audience without appealing to reason. Over the past centuries, anti-Russian propaganda has been founded on juxtaposing the West and Russia as European versus Asiatic, civilized versus barbaric, modern versus backward, liberal versus autocratic, and even good versus evil. Russia has therefore throughout history been allowed to play one of two roles\u2015either an apprentice of Western civilization by accepting the subordinate role as the student and political object, or a threat that must be contained or defeated. While propaganda has the positive effect of promoting unity and mobilizing resources against an adversary, it has the negative effect of creating irrational decision-making and obstructing a workable peace. Glenn Diesen is a Professor at the University of South-Eastern-Norway."

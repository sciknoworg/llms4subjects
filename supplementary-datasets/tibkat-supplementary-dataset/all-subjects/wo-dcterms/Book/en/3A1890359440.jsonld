                "This introductory textbook/reference addresses the fundamental and mostly applied kinds of models. The focus is on models of dynamic systems that move and change over time. However, the work also proposes new methods of uncertainty treatment, offering supporting examples. Topics and features: Chapters suitable for textbook use in teaching modeling and simulation Includes sections of questions and answers, helpful in didactic work Proposes new methodology in addition to examining conventional approaches Offers some cognitive, more abstract models to give a wider insight on model building Aimed primarily at undergraduates, the textbook will also serve graduates and researchers working on multidisciplinary problems. It may be used while teaching computer simulation, applied mathematics, system analysis and system dynamics. Stanislaw Raczynski is affiliated with the Universidad Panamericana, Engineering Faculty, Mexico City, Mexico. He also has authored the recent Springer book, Catastrophes and Unexpected Behavior Patterns in Complex Artificial Populations."

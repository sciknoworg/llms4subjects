In the context of young people\u2019s heightened politicization, Belonging and Becoming in a Multicultural World, shifts the focus to a group of Sudanese and Karen refugee youth\u2019s own insights, explanations and practices as they attempt to create a sense of identity and belonging. It sees these young people engaging race, racism and national identity in creative and unexpected ways as they are confronted with the social and moral implications of multiculturalism in Australia",

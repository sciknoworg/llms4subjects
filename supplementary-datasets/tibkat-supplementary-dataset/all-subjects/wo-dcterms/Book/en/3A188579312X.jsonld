            "abstract": "Collective monograph contains the results of scientific research devoted to the search for effective scientific and applied solutions for the operation of logistics systems. The problems posed are considered through the prism of technological and economic views, which contributes to the formation of the practical significance of the results of systematic research, which are highlighted in the monograph.  Section 1 examines which multimodal logistics solutions in emergency situations and transport security threats have proven effective during the war in Ukraine. The given transport and logistics solutions can be considered promising from the point of view of integrative capabilities at a new level of transport competitiveness and defense capability.  In Section 2, practical measures are proposed to improve logistics solutions in transport and customs services in international traffic to ensure the efficiency and reliability of the national economy.  In Section 3, the impact of information provision of truck crews performing transport tasks on road traffic is investigated, and an effective scheme for information support of cargo delivery conditions is developed.  In Section 4, solutions are proposed for evaluating the effectiveness of the ecological system project using the \"discounted payback period\" criterion, which takes into account transformational changes in its life cycle model.  In Section 5, solutions are proposed that allow for a reasonable selection of the composition of consumers and partners for each enterprise, taking into account their characteristics and strategies of information interaction, ensuring an increase in the efficiency of the \"consumer - enterprise - partner\" system based on the criterion of profit maximization.  The monograph is intended for practitioners who are engaged in the search and implementation of effective technological solutions in the field of logistics, in particular according to economic criteria, and scientists who investigate applied problems of the functioning of logistics systems. The monograph can also be useful to postgraduate and master's students of universities in the relevant educational and scientific profile",

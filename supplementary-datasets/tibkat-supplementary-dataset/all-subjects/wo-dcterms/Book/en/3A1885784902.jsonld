            "abstract": "Education for Social Justice is a statement of the role of education in promoting social justice. Drawing on research, this book explains what social justice is, presents the argument that democracy requires a commitment to social justice, and shows what action steps need to be taken to ensure social justice is achieved within education and society more broadly. The text presents research and concrete examples to examine the social justice issues facing society today. Some of the social justice topics explored include access to higher education, informal education (such as museums and art galleries) and adequate civic education, and racial and gender discrimination within education, as well as access to healthcare and the vote, which impact students\u2019 learning. It explores specific research and action for each of these elements and, at the end of the book, provides potential paths forward to improve social justice outcomes. This timely book encourages readers to consider what we can do to enhance social justice in education and society. It is important reading for pre-service teachers, particularly those studying teaching for social justice, social studies education, and educational policy and politics, as well as for in-service teachers who want to make a difference",

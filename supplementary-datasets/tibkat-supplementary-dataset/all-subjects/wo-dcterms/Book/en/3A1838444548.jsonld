                "Chapter 1. Introduction -- Chapter 2: Theoretical and Conceptual Discussion -- Chapter 3: Service Delivery Process: An Analysis of the Content and Context -- Chapter 5: Evaluation of Local Service Delivery: Perceptions of the Service Recipients -- Chapter. 6: Conclusion.",
                "This book illuminates the importance of the citizen charter (CC) in local service delivery in Bangladesh. It describes how CC was implemented into the service delivery process and its impact. In the 1970s, the transition from traditional public administration to new public management was inspired by globalization, the emergence of an information and technological society, and many economic theories, such as public choice, principal-agent theory, and transaction cost. The purpose of the government in a welfare state is to serve the citizens by providing essential services. However, public service delivery in most developing nations is ineffective owing to corruption, waste of public funds, a lack of responsibility on the part of public employees, etc. In this context, CC emerged as a means of educating individuals on many elements of services, so they may hold service providers accountable. Thus, the issue of framing and implementation of CC has been put in place due to the persistent pressing of academicians, politicians, and practitioners advocating for better local service delivery.

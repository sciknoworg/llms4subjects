                "This open access book studies various ways popular music produces relations of geographic scale. Scales are sets of spatial frames, abstractions or categories that denote the size, proportion, level, extent or hierarchical relations of phenomena. They are neither natural nor neutral but actively produced, with real political effects. But what role do cultural practices play in the production of scale? Phil Dodds addresses this question by focusing on music, arguing that music scholarship has both most to gain from and most to offer to a fuller conceptualisation of how geographical scale is culturally produced. Dodds suggests that music scholars should treat scales as open questions, and as phenomena potentially made through musical practices, rather than as stable categories for framing other arguments about, say, \u2018local\u2019 or \u2018global\u2019 music. He analyses how the meaning of \u2018the local\u2019 is affected by the aesthetics of popular music, and how the relationship between the particular and the general is fused through common musical conventions. Music and the Cultural Production of Scale explores diverse musical examples \u2013 including Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s concept albums, key tracks in the grime genre, protest songs at environmental and anti-fascist demonstrations, and nineteenth-century colonial hymn-singing \u2013 to demonstrate how we already live in a world whose scales are made by music. The book also shows that music has the potential to produce a world scaled otherwise."

            "abstract": "\"Successful production of optical coatings, especially complex coatings with dozens or hundreds of layers, requires knowledge of the fundamentals of optical coating design, characterization, and monitoring. These topics are interconnected at the physical and mathematical levels. The primary goal of this book is to introduce the most important physical and mathematical concepts underlying state-of-the-art design, characterization, and monitoring techniques without the use of cumbersome mathematical derivations. The most comprehensive modern design approaches, including those based on the needle optimization and gradual evolution design techniques, as well as special design approaches used to solve specific design problems, such as the design of narrow band-pass filters, are discussed. Preproduction characterization of single thin films and postproduction characterization of manufactured optical coatings are also presented. Finally, the main types of monochromatic and broadband optical monitoring are covered, including the latest results of the error self-compensation effect associated with optical monitoring of coating production.\"--",

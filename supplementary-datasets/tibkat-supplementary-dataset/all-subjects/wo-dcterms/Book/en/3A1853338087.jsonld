This book consists of thirteen published articles. This Special Issue belongs to the \"Mechatronic and Intelligent Machines\" section. Industry 4.0 is characterized by the integration of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing, into traditional manufacturing and production processes. CAx (Computer-Aided Systems) systems are a set of computer software tools used in engineering and product design, covering various stages of the product development cycle. Advanced CAx tools combine many different aspects of product lifecycle management (PLM), including design, finite element analysis (FEA), manufacturing, production planning and product. In connection with the transition to Industry 4.0 concepts, the concept of the digital twin comes to the fore, and existing CAx systems must adapt to this trend. The Special Issue deals with a number of research areas, such as: - New trends in CAx systems; Digital manufacturing; Internet of Things in manufacturing; Simulation of production systems and processes; Systems for advanced finite element analysis; Material engineering; Digitization and 3D scanning",

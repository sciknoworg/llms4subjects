                "\u201cJohan H\u00f6glund has given us a powerful and insightful account of how American hegemony has produced not only climate crisis but a self-serving emergency narrative. Gracefully and clearly written, his book illuminates the entangled relations of cultural power, capitalist rapacity, and the American war machine in the making of climate crisis.\u201d \u2014Jason W. Moore, Binghamton University, USA \u201cA stunning, original and compelling reading of American cultural work that fully realises the long roots of capitalism\u2019s climate emergency. H\u00f6glund takes a world-ecological lens to an innovative and impressive range of texts and in so doing repurposes our understanding of the climate narrative.\u201d \u2014Graeme Macdonald, University of Warwick, UK \u201cH\u00f6glund\u2019s work is critical to understanding the current cultural moment in the US, wherein the \u2018policing of the imagination\u2019 is resisted at the margins, while cultural elites and the US state promote climate emergency narratives that attempt to naturalize alternatives to the socio-ecological violence of capitalist expansion via imperialism and colonialism.\u201d \u2014Hannah Holleman, Amherst College, USA \u201cMoving from plantation cultures to the post-apocalyptic, H\u00f6glund\u2019s indispensable study proposes a corrective to conventional ecocritical readings.\u201d \u2014Pramod K. Nayar, University of Hyderabad, India This open access book reveals how much of what has been called \u201cclimate fiction\u201d casts ecological breakdown as an emergency for American capitalist modernity rather than for the planet. The book traces the origins of this narrative back to the arrival of settler capitalism in America, when the understanding of the planet and its people as extractable resources was established. Since then, this narrative has elided the violent history of the climate crisis while at the same time leveraging the military as a bulwark against the crises capitalism has caused, the people it has uprooted, even the ailing planet itself. Johan H\u00f6glund is Professor of English at Linnaeus University, Sweden."

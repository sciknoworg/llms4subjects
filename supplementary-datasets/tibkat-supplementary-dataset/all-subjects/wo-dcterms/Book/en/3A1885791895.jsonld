            "abstract": "Millets are a group of small-seeded grasses that have been grown as food sources for humans and animals since ancient times. These crops are highly nutritious and have a range of health benefits. They are also highly adaptable to different growing conditions, making them an important crop for farmers in arid and drought-prone regions. Millets have been an integral part of the traditional diets of many cultures around the world and have gained renewed attention in recent years as a sustainable, low-input alternative to other cereal crops. Despite their many benefits, millets have been largely overlooked by modern industrial agriculture, and their cultivation and use have declined in many regions. There is a growing recognition of the need to promote and support the conservation and revival of millet cultivation as a key strategy to enhance food security and resilience in the face of climate change",

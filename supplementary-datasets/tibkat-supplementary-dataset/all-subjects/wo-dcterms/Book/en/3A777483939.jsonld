                "On November 5-8, 1974, a Seminar on Research and De\u00ad velopment of Immobilized Enzymes was held in Tokyo, Japan. The seminar was part of the United States-Japan Cooperative Science Program sponsored jointly by the National Science Foundation and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Sci\u00ad ence. The purpose of the seminar was to promote the scienti\u00ad fic exchange of ideas and scien~ific results of a practical nature, as well as academic advances made in both countries through discussion and exchange of ideas. The areas chosen for discussion included: fundamental research in immobilized enzymes, new techniques of enzyme purification, comparative studies on immobilization techni\u00ad ques and the relative merits, chemical engineering aspects of the technology, industrial applications and reactor de\u00ad sign. The discussions and exchange of ideas which took place at the seminar should promote new research and development which we hope will lead to new important advances in enzyme technology. These proceedings represent the summation of the work presented and discussed at the seminar. The editors hope the reader will find them interesting and informative. Howard H.

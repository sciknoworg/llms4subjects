            "title": "My Own Portrait in Writing: Self-Fashioning in the Letters of Vincent van Gogh",
            "abstract": "Art historians, biographers, and other researchers have long drawn on Van Gogh\u2019s voluminous correspondence\u2014more than eight hundred letters\u2014for insights into both his personal struggles and his art. But the letters, while often admired for their literary quality, have rarely been approached as literature. In this volume, Patrick Grant sets out to explore the question, \u201cBy what criteria do we judge Van Gogh's letters to be, specifically, literary?\u201d Drawing, especially, on Mikhail Bakhtin\u2019s conceptualization of self-awareness as an ongoing dialogue between \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother,\u201d Grant examines the ways in which Van Gogh\u2019s letters raise, from within themselves, questions and issues to which they also respond. Their literary quality, he argues, derives in part from this \u201cdouble-voiced discourse\u201d\u2014from the power of the letters to thematize, through their own internal dialogues, the very structure of self-fashioning itself. Far from merely reproducing the narrative of the artist\u2019s personal progress, \u201cthe letters enable readers to recognize how necessary yet open-ended, constrained yet liberating, confined yet unpredictable, are the means by which people seek to shape a place for themselves in the world.\u201d This volume builds on Grant\u2019s earlier analysis of Van Gogh\u2019s correspondence, The Letters of Vincent van Gogh: A Critical Study (AU Press, 2014), a study in which he approached the letters from a literary critical standpoint, delving into key patterns of metaphors and concepts. In the present volume, he provides instead a literary theoretical analysis of the letters, one that draws them more fully into the domain of modern literary studies. In his deft and keenly perceptive reading, Grant deconstructs the binaries that surface in both Van Gogh\u2019s writing and painting, discusses the narrative dimensions of the letter-sketches and the recurring themes of fantasy, belief, and self-surrender, and draws attention to Van Gogh\u2019s own understanding of the permeable boundary between words and visual art. Viewing the letters as an integrated body of discourse, \u201cMy Own Portrait in Writing\u201d offers a theoretically informed interpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s literary achievement that is, quite literally, without precedent",

            "abstract": "This book contains six chapters dealing with the investigation of seismic and sequence stratigraphy and integrated stratigraphy, including the stratigraphic unconformities, in different geological settings and using several techniques and methods, including the seismostratigraphic and the sequence stratigraphic analysis, the field geological survey, the well log stratigraphic interpretation, and the lithologic and paleobotanical data. Book chapters are separated into two main sections: (i) seismic and sequence stratigraphy and (ii) integrated stratigraphy. There are three chapters in the first section, including the application of sequence and seismic stratigraphy to the fine-grained shales, to the fluvial facies and depositional environments, and to the Late Miocene geological structures offshore of Taiwan. In the second section, there are three chapters dealing with the integrated stratigraphic investigation of Jurassic deposits of the southern Siberian platform, with the stratigraphic unconformities, reviewing the related geological concepts and studying examples from Middle-Upper Paleozoic successions; and, finally, with the integrated stratigraphy of the Cenozoic deposits of the Andean foreland basin (northwestern Argentina)",

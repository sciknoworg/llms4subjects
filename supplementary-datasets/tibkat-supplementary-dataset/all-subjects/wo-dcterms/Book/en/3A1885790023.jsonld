            "abstract": "Drying Science and Technology provides a thorough and current investigation of the complex area of drying processes. This book is a collaborative effort that brings together prominent professionals to give a comprehensive grasp of drying science\u2019s concepts, methodology, and applications. The book opens by underlining the importance of drying operations in a variety of sectors, including food preservation and materials processing. This opening portion provides the framework for a varied investigation that will appeal to a wide range of readers. The book covers fundamental ideas and digs into the heat and mass transport mechanisms that underpin drying processes. Readers are taken through the fundamentals that determine the efficiency and quality of drying processes, laying the groundwork for additional in-depth research. A large portion of the book is dedicated to a variety of drying processes and procedures, both traditional and cutting-edge. From basic convection drying to modern technologies such as freeze drying and microwave drying, each strategy is evaluated for its uses, benefits, and drawbacks. This broad cover guarantees that readers obtain a full understanding of the equipment available for various drying applications. The use of mathematical modeling provides a quantitative dimension to the book, with chapters focused on the development, evaluation, and application of models in drying science. This part is intended for scholars and practitioners who want a better knowledge of the quantitative features that underpin the discipline. The book highlights the dynamic nature of drying research and includes the most recent advances in drying technology. Innovations in equipment and approaches highlight the changing landscape of drying research, providing insights into cutting-edge discoveries that will impact the field\u2019s future. With a balanced combination of theoretical insights and practical applications, Drying Science and Technology is an invaluable resource for students, researchers, and professionals working in the various fields of drying",

            "abstract": "As the Covid-19 pandemic strikes hard, protests in Hong Kong appear to have abated. Distant seem the days when yellow umbrellas and balaclavas saturated global media. And yet, just like at the start of what has now come to be known as the 2019 \u201cglobal protest wave\u201d, Hong Kong remains at the frontline of political contestation worldwide. The protests against the 2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition law unearthed one of the main points of contention between Hong Kong and mainland China. Through the protests, China\u2019s increasingly assertive stance has found a counterweight, revealing how important the city is to Beijing. China\u2019s actions towards Hong Kong might serve as a litmus test for Beijing\u2019s ability to mediate and pacify its neighbourhood. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic risks further heightening tensions between the Hong Kong and the mainland. What makes Hong Kong so special? To what extent have the protests exacerbated or eased over time? How will the city\u2019s role in mainland China\u2019s outward-looking plans change, if the protests continue?",

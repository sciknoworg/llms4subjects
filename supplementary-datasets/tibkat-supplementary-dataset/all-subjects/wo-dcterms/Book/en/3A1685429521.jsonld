            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics provides undergraduate chemistry students with a grounding in both classical and statistical thermodynamics. Thermodynamic quantities and relationships are introduced and developed in a coherent way, enabling students to apply thermodynamic analysis to chemical problems with confidence. Each stage in the development is well illustrated with examples. The text aims to help students understand energy, its different forms and transformations, and the key role of entropy, as applied to chemical systems, addressing questions such as: (i) How much work is performed, and how much heat transfer occurs, during chemical processes and reactions, and how do they depend on temperature? (ii) How is it possible for endothermic processes to occur spontaneously, and will a given reaction occur spontaneously? (iii) What determines the equilibrium between phases? (iv) How do temperature and pressure affect equilibrium? (v) What is the meaning of entropy? (vi) How are macroscopic thermodynamic properties related to microscopic energy levels?  Ideal for the needs of undergraduate chemistry students, Tutorial Chemistry Texts is a major series consisting of short, single topic or modular texts concentrating on the fundamental areas of chemistry taught in undergraduate science courses. Each book provides a concise account of the basic principles underlying a given subject, embodying an independent-learning philosophy and including worked examples",

            "abstract": "\"Whole-cell biocatalysis is a promising and emerging field of biological science that is mostly based on advancements in biosystems engineering for the production of useful products such as chemicals, fuels, and pharmaceuticals. It is a unique platform that provides an efficient catalytic system at affordable cost and with low maintenance. Recent studies have proven that whole-cell catalysis is very useful in conducting many complex and complicated chemical reactions that could be executed with greater ease and in an eco-friendly manner in ambient conditions with zero/minimal ecological effect. This has made whole-cell biocatalysis very popular and a center of significance in the field of modern biological catalysis. This new volume offers a comprehensive understanding of whole-cell biocatalysis, beginning with an introduction and an overview of relevant tools and techniques. It presents the basic as well as the advanced concepts of whole-cell biocatalysis, thus acting as a complete guide for the reader. It looks at the promising developments that have taken place in the past decade and discusses the application of computational tools, the use of metabolic flux systems, and the role of metabolic networks for the cell system development for whole-cell catalysis. The chapters explore whole-cell biocatalysis for the production of chemicals, of fuels, and for environmental restoration, with case studies and success stories that showcase new developments in the technology. This volume provides a valuable presentation of whole-cell biocatalysis for graduate students, faculty, industry professionals, and others working in biochemistry and bio-systems engineering\"--",

            "abstract": "Gender, language and hate speech: Are these concepts unrelated to each other, or is it possible to find a common research thread that allows us to understand them as two aspects of the same social phenomenon? This is the question to which the book aims to give an answer, through the support of experts and scholars in the areas of Linguistics, Education, Sociology, Legal and Political Studies. The volume collects some of the papers presented at the LIGHTS (Gender equality and hate words / Language gender and HaTe Speech) conference, held at Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice on October 2018, which represented a significant moment of discussion and confrontation on the power of language for the maintenance or, hopefully, the deconstruction of social and political stereotypes",

            "abstract": "\"This volume, Mechatronic Systems Design and Solid Materials: Methods and Practices, looks at many important advanced applications in this field. It elaborates on mechatronics as the synergistic integration of mechanical engineering with electronics and intelligent computer control in the design and manufacturing of industrial products and processes. It looks at the integration of mechanical systems (mechanical elements, components, machines), electronic systems (microelectronics, sensor and actuator technology), and information technology. The volume presents the principles of mechatronic systems design and solid materials in small elementary steps; keeps the mathematics at a reasonable level; provides an abundance of examples; and features problems that are as practical as possible without becoming too involved with many extraneous details. Key features: Covers some recent applications and impact areas of applied mechanics and mechatronics engineering Reviews fundamentals of mechatronics engineering Presents case studies and research methodology for practical mechanics and mechatronics engineering Provides studies of mathematical models and failure criteria Introduces a straightforward approach on derivation of mechanical/mathematical results with emphasis on issues of practical importance The volume will be useful for practicing mechanical/mechatronic engineers and designers, researchers, and graduate and postgraduate students with a knowledge of mechanics focused directly on advanced applications\"--",

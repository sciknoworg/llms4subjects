            "abstract": "Amid noticeable improvements and achievements in the reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child health, and nutrition landscape in Bangladesh, existing evidence suggests that further accelerated progress hinges on strategic investment decision making. Addressing the top service utilization determinants that are both context- and time-specific is one cost-effective way of improving the unmet reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child health, and nutrition outcomes in a short timeframe. Against this backdrop, using machine learning analysis, the overall aim of this study was to help Bangladesh identify priority investment areas that could accelerate reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child health, and nutrition utilization, quality, and outcomes over the short run, by comparing the relative importance of demand- and-supply-side determinants of key reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child health, and nutrition indicators over the past decade (across two time points). Two rounds of the Bangladesh Health Facility Survey and the Demographic and Health Survey (2014 and 2017) were analyzed. The findings indicate that the relative importance of the demand-side determinants (except wealth and education status) have recently declined. Conversely, investments in key supply-side determinants (for example, availability of skilled staff, readiness for care, and quality of care) could provide a thrust toward further increases in utilization. Immediate attention is needed to address the regressive role of wealth status on utilization through, for example, demand-side financing that goes beyond user fee exemptions. Further, developing strategies to improve the engagement of community health workers in reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child health, and nutrition utilization and tapping into the potential of mobile health technology to support community health workers' performance and women's awareness could help to boost utilization patterns",

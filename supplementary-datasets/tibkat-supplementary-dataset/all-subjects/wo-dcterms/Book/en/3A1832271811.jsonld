            "abstract": "As everyone knows, cereal and oil are still the main part of our diet and provide essential nutrients and energy every day. With the progress of food processing technology, the quality of cereal and oil food is also improved significantly. Behind this, major nutrients of grain and oil, including protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and functional components, have experienced a variety of physical, chemical, and biological reactions during food processing. Moreover, research in this field also covers the multi-scale structural changes of characteristic components, such as component interaction and formation of key domains, which is essential for the quality enhancement of cereal and oil food. Based on the increasing consumer demand for nourishing, healthy, and delicious cereal and oil food, it might be interesting to report the latest research on the application of novel technology in food processing, multi-scale structural changes of characteristic components in food processing, structure-activity mechanism of food functional components. This book aimed to provide useful reference and guidance for the processing and utilization of cereal and oil food so as to provide technical support for the healthy development of cereal a oil food processing industry wordwide",

            "abstract": "Estimation and Control of Large Scale Networked Systemsis the first book that systematically summarizes results on large-scale networked systems. In addition, the book also summarizes the most recent results on structure identification of a networked system, attack identification and prevention. Readers will find the necessary mathematical knowledge for studying large-scale networked systems, as well as a systematic description of the current status of this field, the features of these systems, difficulties in dealing with state estimation and controller design, and major achievements. Numerical examples in chapters provide strong application backgrounds and/or are abstracted from actual engineering problems, such as gene regulation networks and electricity power systems. This book is an ideal resource for researchers in the field of systems and control engineering.Provides necessary mathematical knowledge for studying large scale networked systemsIntroduces new features for filter and control design of networked control systemsSummarizes the most recent results on structural identification of a networked system, attack identification and prevention",

                "Between 4-7 September 1979, an international workshop on Appropriate Technology (AT) was organized in Delft, Netherlands, by the Center for Appropriate Technology of the Delft University of Technology. Representatives of 24 AT organisations from allover the world held discussions on the role of AT as a factor in development. There were two main objectives of the workshop - to enlarge the understanding of, and knowledge about the processes and conditions essential for the introduction of AT in regional deve\u00ad lopment programs. This was formally referred to as 'the implementation of the results of AT research'. -secondly, an evaluation of the theories and models which have been applied for the establishment of these regional development programs. This was formally referred to as 'an inventory of AT concepts.' The workshop discussions focussed essentially on three issue areas: technology and development, organisational framework, and education and research. A summary of the conclusions and recommendatjons made by the workshop can be found in Chapter One of this report of the proceedings. All participants were invited, prior to the workshop, to outline their ideas on the subjects listed above, in position papers. Condensed versions of these papers are presented in Chapter Three."

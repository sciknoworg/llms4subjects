            "abstract": "Probiotic microorganisms are recognised as being beneficial for human health. Prebiotics are substrates that are used preferentially by the probiotic bacteria for their growth. A great deal of interest has been generated in recent years in identifying probiotic bacteria and prebiotics, their characterization, mechanisms of action and their role in the prevention and management of human health disorders. Together they are referred to as synbiotic. This book is in response to the need for more current and global scope of probiotics and prebiotics. It contains chapters written by internationally recognized authors. The book has been planned to meet the needs of the researchers, health professionals, government regulatory agencies and industries. This book will serve as a standard reference book in this important and fast-growing area of probiotics and prebiotics in human nutrition and health",

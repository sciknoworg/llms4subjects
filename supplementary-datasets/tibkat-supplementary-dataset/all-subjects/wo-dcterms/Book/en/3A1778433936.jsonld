            "abstract": "In 2018, the International Symposium on Nanogeoscience was held in Guiyang, China. Scholars from around the globe gathered to discuss recent progress and development trends in various aspects of nanogeoscience, including nanomineralogy. Nanomineralogy, an important aspect of nanogeoscience, focuses on the composition, structure, and physical and chemical properties of nanoscale minerals and their interrelations with other Earth critical components. To give a sampling of the latest progress in nanomineralogy and related fields, we offer this Special Issue, which describes a full range of recent nanomineralogic achievements relating to everything from nanominerals and geochemistry, mineral nanostructures, and nanomineral deformation, to nanopores in oil and gas reservoirs, nanomineral deposits, and nanomineral material. Today, nanomineralogy faces a new strategic opportunity as well as a revolutionary challenge. We thus present this special nanomineralogy-focused issue of Minerals with the aim of encouraging our colleagues to familiarize themselves with current developments, trends, and directions in nanomineralogy, enabling an understanding of the potential of the field as a whole. We look forward to developing further scientific research and cooperation in nanomineralogy, hoping thereby to attract and guide young scholars to participate in this field",

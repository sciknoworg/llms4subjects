            "abstract": "\"This textbook, Computational Fluid Dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics: A Step-by-Step Approach for Chemical Engineers, covers computational fluid dynamics simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae Modeling Software in chemical engineering applications. In the volume, the COMSOL Multiphysics package is introduced and applied to solve typical problems in chemical reactors, transport processes, fluid flow, and heat and mass transfer. Inspired by the difficulties of introducing the use of COMSOL Multiphysics software during classroom time, the book incorporates the author's experience of working with undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students, which helps to make the book user friendly and that, at the same time, addresses typical examples within the subjects covered in the chemical engineering curriculum. Real-world problems require the use of simulation and optimization tools, and this volume shows how COMSOL Multiphysics software can be used for that purpose. The book includes over 560 snapshots to provide a step-by-step approach to using the program for computational fluid dynamics simulations. Key features: Includes step-by-step screenshots for all the examples Shows the graphical user interface of COMSOL, which does not require any programming effort Provides chapter-end problems for extensive practice along with solutions Includes actual examples of chemical reactors, transport processes, fluid flow, and heat and mass transfer This book is intended for students who want or need more help to solve chemical engineering assignments using computer software. It can also be used for computational courses in chemical engineering. It will also be a valuable resource for professors, research scientists, and practicing engineers\"--",

                "\u201cIn an era of imperilled democracies, this outstanding collection brings together leading experts to provide insightful essays on the changing implications of citizenship \u2013 both within nations and transnationally. Carving new directions for research, it considers the compromised citizenships that have been experienced by Indigenous peoples and migrant communities.\u201d -Ann McGrath, AM, AAH, ASSA, WK Hancock Chair and Kathleen Fitzpatrick Laureate Fellow, Australian National University \u201cThis is an excellent analysis of multiculturalism and Indigenous rights in three settler states. With a world class collection of experts, this second edition showcases a wider range of gendered, Indigenous, and racialized voices. It provides timely and cogent perspectives on the state of race relations in Australia, Canada, and Aotearoa New Zealand.\u201d -David MacDonald, Professor of Political Science, University of Guelph \u201cThis welcome new edition continues successfully to blend multidisciplinary contributions from well-established and emerging scholars on British settler societies. They provide readable and thought-provoking insights into the transition from imperial to recent transnational citizenship models. Longstanding issues of Indigenous and immigrant rights claims are skilfully interwoven with contemporary debates concerning ethnic, national, and multinational identity in local and global settings.\u201d -David Pearson, Adjunct Professor, Te Herenga Waka \u2013 Victoria University of Wellington This edited collection brings together leading and emerging international scholars who explore citizenship through the two overarching themes of Indigeneity and ethnicity. They approach the subject from a range of disciplinary perspectives: historical, legal, political, and sociological. Therefore, this book makes an important and unique contribution to the existing literature through its transnational, inter- and multidisciplinary perspectives. The collection includes scholars whose work on citizenship in settler societies moves beyond the idea of inclusion (fitting into extant citizenship regimes) to innovative models of inclusivity (refitting existing models) to reflect the multiple identities of an increasingly post-national era, and to promote the recognition of Indigenous citizenships and rights that were suppressed as a formative condition of citizenship in these societies.

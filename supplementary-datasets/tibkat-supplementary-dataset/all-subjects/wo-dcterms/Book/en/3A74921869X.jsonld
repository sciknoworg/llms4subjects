            "abstract": "Industrial Energy Management: Principles and Applications provides an overall view of the energy management approach by following the stream of energy from factory boundaries to end users. All topics are examined from the point of view of plant users rather than from that of designers and only the basic concepts necessary to clarify the operation of the plants are outlined. Industrial Energy Management: Principles and Applications is written both as a textbook for university courses in engineering and as a work of reference for professionals in energy management. Readers are assumed to have a basic knowledge of thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, electric systems and power electronics, as well as computer programming. This book can be used not only by technicians involved in the field of energy management but also by managers who may find it a useful tool for understanding investment proposals and even a spur to solicit new ones. Industrial Energy Management: Principles and Applications consists of 21 chapters concerning general principles of energy transformation and energy sources, transformation plants such as electrical substantions and boiler plants, cogeneration plants, electrical and thermal fluid distribution lines, facilities plants such as pumps and fans, air compressors, cooling, HVAC and lighting systems, heat recovery equipment, principles of energy auditing and accounting by using computers, correlation between energy and waste, education in the field. At the end of the book a chapter has been dedicated to economic analysis of energy saving investments and evaluation is given of all the cases studied in the book",

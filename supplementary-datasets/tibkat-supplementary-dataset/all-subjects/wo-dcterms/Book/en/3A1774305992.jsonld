            "title": "Kazakhstan Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment 2018",
            "abstract": "Kazakhstan, which has a population of about 18 million, has made enormous social and economic progress since it became independent in 1991. The economy grew at an annual rate of 6.6 per cent during the decade up to 2014, driven by the development of oil and gas and other mineral resources. Income per capita in US dollars multiplied by ten times during the period up to 2014, and poverty was reduced to 4 percent of the population.This assessment was initiated in March 2018. Where the performance ratings are based on three years of PFM statistics, the period is 2015-17, with 2017 as the most recent completed fiscal year. Administrative arrangements and practices are assessed as they were in the second quarter of 2018. The assessment focuses on the Central Government's Republican Budget (RB), covering subnational governments, which are responsible for about 40 percent of spending on public services, and public corporations only to the extent required by the PEFA criteria.The PEFA assessment shows that the Government is able to maintain aggregate fiscal discipline in difficult times, and that taxation, financial control and payment and accounting systems all work efficiently. Investment planning is under effective central direction as is demonstrated by city development and infrastructure improvements achieved since 2000. However, as the WB review points out, the share of GDP absorbed by government expenditure is low compared with the OECD average, leaving much scope for improvement in health and education services. Strategic planning is well-established throughout Government, contributing to a more strategic allocation of resources, but greater clarity is needed in demonstrating the links between policy instruments and objectives, with a fuller explanation of the performance targets and results. Medium-term forecasts cover only the three years immediately ahead, and there are no projections beyond that horizon which would demonstrate how fiscal sustainability is to be maintained, given the development of the Government's assets and liabilities",

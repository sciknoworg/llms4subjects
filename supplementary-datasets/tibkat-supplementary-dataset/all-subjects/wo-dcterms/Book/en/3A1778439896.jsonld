The Special Issue was managed by two Guest Editors from Italy and Norway: Professor Sergio Saponara from the University of Pisa and Professor Lucian MIHET-POPA from \u00d8stfold University College, in close cooperation with the Editors from Energies. The papers published in this SI are related to the emerging trends in energy storage and power conversion electronic circuits and systems, with a specific focus on transportation electrification, and on the evolution from the electric grid to a smart grid. An extensive exploitation of renewable energy sources is foreseen for the smart grid, as well as a close integration with the energy storage and recharging systems of the electrified transportation era. Innovations at the levels of both algorithmic and hardware (i.e., power converters, electric drives, electronic control units (ECU), energy storage modules and charging stations) are proposed. Research and technology transfer activities in energy storage systems, such as batteries and super/ultra-capacitors, are essential for the success of electric transportation, and to foster the use of renewable energy sources. Energy storage systems are the key technology to solve these issues, and to increase the adoption of renewable energy sources in the smart grid",

            "abstract": "Pepper Virome: Molecular Biology, Diagnostics and Management presents detailed information about the plant viruses that infect pepper worldwide, providing crucial insights for both the scientific community and producers. Understanding the nature of the viruses, their transmission methods, and possible sources of resistance in order to minimize the yield losses as well as to reduce the spread of these viruses to new locations or countries is of global importance. Pepper is an important commodity worldwide, cultivated for both fresh produce and for processing industry as a spice. However, various diseases affect pepper production and cause significant yield losses in pepper yield. The increasing outbreaks of virus species infecting Capsicum spp. have become a major problem for growers. A combination of factors, including expansion and intensification of pepper cultivation, availability of volunteer hosts, abundance of insect vectors, and climate change have all contributed to the issue. This book provides in-depth information on both the viruses infecting peppers and eco-friendly management measures to decrease the rate of spread of viruses",

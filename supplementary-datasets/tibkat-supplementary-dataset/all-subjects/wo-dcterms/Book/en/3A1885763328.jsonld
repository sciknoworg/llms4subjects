            "abstract": "In the mid-19th century, the scientific community was convinced that physics had been fully discovered and only isolated, peripheral issues remained unexplained. One of these was black body radiation (CDC) and the transformation of electromagnetic waves. In 1893, Wien proved that the wavelength at which CDC radiates the greatest amount of energy is inversely proportional to body temperature. Surprisingly, the formula resulting from current, reliable physics describes CDC radiation very well only at low frequencies. For ultraviolet frequencies, the obtained function was constantly upwards. Planck proposed the distribution of the CDC radiation spectrum, assuming that the radiation can only be emitted in precisely defined portions known as quanta. This was the year of the creation of quantum physics, one of the foundations of modern physics. Aristotle recognized that there is a distinctive frame of reference. This view was challenged by Galileo, who concluded that the speed and position of the body are relative. The Galilean transformation became the foundation of Newtonian physics. However, Maxwell\u2019s equations describing electromagnetic waves were not subject to the Galilean transformation but rather to the Lorentz transformation. The biggest problem at the beginning of the 20th century was the incompatibility of the laws of dynamics and electromagnetism. The theory of relativity is another foundation of modern physics. The last year of the 19th century debunked the myth of full understanding of the laws of nature. It quickly turned out that the knowledge about the universe at that time was very little. This lack of knowledge led to a rapid reconstruction of physics in the first half of the 20th century. is book discusses some of these subjects, including spinor fields, 5D relativity, dissipative quantum system and energy balance, centrifugal acceleration in relativistic astrophysics, and time-dependent photoluminescence",

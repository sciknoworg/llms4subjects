Subject to all evolutionary facets of organic chemistry, its perpetual developments reimagined within the current organic synthesis (strategies, methodologies, reaction mechanisms, reagents, catalysts, chemical and instrumental auxiliaries) nevertheless obey two crucial common denominators, \"selectivity\" vs. \u201cspecificity\u201d (these terms being, equally, preceded by typical prefixes, either chemo-, regio- or stereo-), as mandatory criteria. The present Special Issue gathered research articles, communications, and review papers, disclosing the most recent advances in organic synthesis, i.e., those related to its near future defined as \u201catomic precision\u201d in chemical reactions. The sustainability of these efforts, which denotes an intrinsic chemical diversity, is expected to highlight, to the interested readers, their innovative applications in human life and the environment",

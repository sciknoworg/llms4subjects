            "abstract": "Historical studies on the practice of Islamic law (shar\u012b\u02bfa) tend to focus on practice in a Sunni setting during the Mamluk or Ottoman periods. This book decenters Sunni and Mamluk and Ottoman normativity by investigating the practice of shar\u012b\u02bfa in a Twelver Shi\u02bfi Persian-speaking milieu, in early modern Iran between the sixteenth to twentieth centuries. Drawing on documentary evidence and narrative sources, it reconstructs who the practitioners of Islamic law were, how they authenticated, annulled, and archived legal documents, and how they intervened in the resolution of disputes over religious endowments (waqf). The study demonstrates that following Iran's conversion to Twelver Shi\u02bfism under the Safavids, the dominance of U\u1e63\u016bl\u012b Shi\u02bfi legal theory, which conferred judicial authority on scholars recognized as Shi\u02bfi jurists (mujathids), affected both the practitioners of Islamic law and the procedures of shar\u012b\u02bfa court practice in Iran. Shi\u02bfi jurists in Iran, as a result, would come to exercise by the end of the nineteenth century a judicial monopoly over valid shar\u012b\u02bfa court practice thus laying the foundation for Ayatollah Khomeini's extension, during the Iranian revolution, of the authority of the Shi\u02bfi jurist over political affairs. ; Historical studies on the practice of Islamic law (shar\u012b\u02bfa) tend to focus on practice in a Sunni setting during the Mamluk or Ottoman periods.

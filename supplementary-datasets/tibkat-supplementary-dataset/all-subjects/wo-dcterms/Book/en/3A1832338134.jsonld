            "title": "Theory and Practice of Tunnel Engineering",
            "abstract": "Tunnel construction is expensive when compared to the construction of other engineering structures. As such, there is always the need to develop more sophisticated and effective methods of construction. There are many long and large tunnels with various purposes in the world, especially for highways, railways, water conveyance, and energy production. Tunnels can be designed effectively by means of two and three-dimensional numerical models. Ground-structure interaction is one of the significant factors acting on economic and safe design. This book presents recent data on tunnel engineering to improve the theory and practice of the construction of underground structures. It provides an overview of tunneling technology and includes chapters that address analytical and numerical methods for rock load estimation and design support systems and advances in measurement systems for underground structures. The book discusses the empirical, analytical, and numerical methods of tunneling practice worldwide",

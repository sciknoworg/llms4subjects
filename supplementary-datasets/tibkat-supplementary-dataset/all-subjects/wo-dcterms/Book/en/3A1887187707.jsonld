            "title": "Strategy Beyond the Hockey Stick: People, Probabilities, and Big Moves to Beat the Odds",
            "abstract": "Beat the odds with a bold strategy We\u2019ve all seen hockey stick business plans before. A future where results sail confidently upward, but with a dip coinciding with next year\u2019s budget. CEOs usually rely on their experience and business smarts to figure out which of those hockey sticks are real, and which are fake. But all too often getting to a \u201cyes,\u201d competing for resources, and striving to claim credit, cloud the hard decisions. Another strategy framework? No thanks, we already have plenty of those, and they don\u2019t fix the real problem: the social dynamics in your strategy room. Mining the data from thousands of large companies, McKinsey Partners Chris Bradley, Martin Hirt and Sven Smit open the windows of that room, and bring an \u201coutside view.\u201d They found three discrete groups of companies: the bottom quintile with massive economic losses; the long, flat, middle 60 percent with practically no economic profit; and the top 20 percent to whom all the value accrues. Some companies do achieve real hockey stick performance: but just 1-in-12 jump from the middle tier to the top over a ten year period. This does not happen by magic--there is an empirically-backed science to improve your odds of success by capitalizing on your endowment, riding the right trends, and most importantly, making a few big moves. To make these big moves happen, you\u2019re going to have to break through inertia, gamesmanship and risk aversion. You\u2019re going to have to mitigate human biases and manage group dynamics. Eight practical shifts can help you do this, and unlock bigger, bolder, better strategies. This is not another by-the-book approach to strategy. It\u2019s not another trudge through frameworks or small-scale case studies promising a secret formula for success. It\u2019s an irreverent, fact-driven, and humorous take on the real world of strategic decision making",

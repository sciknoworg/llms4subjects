                "This book publishes contributions of the 1st Olympiad in Engineering Science (OES 2023), an international congress and contest aiming to disseminate and evaluate the recent advances in Engineering Science. The book is divided in several parts. In 'Materials Science,' readers delve into nanostructural correlations in thermochromic VO2 thin films for smart windows, as well as microstructural observations of super duplex stainless steel. The 'Marine Technology' part explores riverbed scour, wave reflection, and innovative nature-based solutions for coastal protection. 'Additive Manufacturing and Welding Technology' delves into studies on carbon fiber-reinforced polymers and fatigue properties of 3D-printed specimens. 'Structural Integrity and Structural Health Monitoring' offers insights into offshore pipeline fatigue life prediction and risk-informed decision-making for existing structures. The 'Non-destructive Testing and Evaluation' part encompasses stress monitoring, rail profile measurement, and health-monitoring approaches for debonding diagnosis. 'Dynamics and Vibrations' ventures into investigations on combined viscous and Coulomb damped systems and seismic signal analysis for landslides. 'Materials Engineering' delves into strengthening reinforced concrete members and dynamic properties of carbon fiber-reinforced polymers. 'Building Materials and Concrete Structures' cover topics like minibar reinforced concrete, impact response of reinforced columns, and residual strength of cement-based composites. 'Electronic Sensors and Intelligent Systems' showcase simulations under high voltage transmission lines, synthesis of BaxSr(1-x)TiO3, and antenna catheter modeling. 'Asset Integrity' discusses analytical and experimental analyses of buckling in aluminum columns and I-beams, lateral-torsional buckling capacity, and modulation of fluid streams. Finally, 'Climate Change and Circular Economy' addresses climate-adaptive design, circular economy integration, and eco-innovative concrete applications with recycled materials. This book provides a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge research and advancements in mechanical and civil engineering, offering valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts in the field."

            "abstract": "Micro- and nano-molding technologies are continuously being developed due to enduring trends like increasing miniaturization and higher functional integration of products, devices, and systems. Furthermore, with the introduction of higher performance polymers, feedstocks, and composites, new opportunities in terms of material properties can be exploited, and, consequently, more micro-products and micro/nano-structured surfaces are currently being designed and manufactured.Innovations in micro- and nano-molding techniques are seen in the different processes employed in production (injection molding, micro injection molding, etc.); on the use of new and functional materials; for an ever-increasing number of applications (health-care devices, micro-implants, mobility, and communications products, optical elements, micro-electromechanical systems, sensors, etc.); in several key enabling technologies that support the successful realization of micro and nano molding processes (micro- and nano-tooling technologies, process monitoring techniques, micro- and nanometrology methods for quality control, simulation, etc.) and their integration into new manufacturing process chains.This Special Issue reprint showcases research papers and review articles that focus on the latest developments in micro-manufacturing and key enabling technologies for the production of both micro-products and micro-structured surfaces",

            "abstract": "The book presents some recent specialized works of a theoretical and practical nature in the field of simulation modeling, which is being addressed to a large number of specialists, mathematicians, doctors, engineers, economists, professors, and students. The book comprises 11 chapters that promote modern mathematical algorithms and simulation modeling techniques, in practical applications, in the following thematic areas: mathematics, biomedicine, systems of systems, materials science and engineering, energy systems, and economics. This project presents scientific papers and applications that emphasize the capabilities of simulation modeling methods, helping readers to understand the phenomena that take place in the real world, the conditions of their development, and their effects, at a high scientific and technical level. The authors have published work examples and case studies that resulted from their researches in the field. The readers get new solutions and answers to questions related to the emerging applications of simulation modeling and their advantages",

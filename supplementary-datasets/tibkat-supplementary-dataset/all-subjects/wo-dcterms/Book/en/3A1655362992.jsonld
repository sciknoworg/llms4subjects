                "Symmetry is a property which occurs throughout nature and it is therefore natural that symmetry should be considered when attempting to model nature. In many cases, these models are also nonlinear and it is the study of nonlinear symmetric models that has been the basis of much recent work. Although systematic studies of nonlinear problems may be traced back at least to the pioneering contributions of Poincare, this remains an area with challenging problems for mathematicians and scientists. Phenomena whose models exhibit both symmetry and nonlinearity lead to problems which are challenging and rich in complexity, beauty and utility. In recent years, the tools provided by group theory and representation theory have proven to be highly effective in treating nonlinear problems involving symmetry. By these means, highly complex situations may be decomposed into a number of simpler ones which are already understood or are at least easier to handle. In the realm of numerical approximations, the systematic exploitation of symmetry via group repre\u00ad sentation theory is even more recent. In the hope of stimulating interaction and acquaintance with results and problems in the various fields of applications, bifurcation theory and numerical analysis, we organized the conference and workshop Bifurcation and Symmetry: Cross Influences between Mathematics and Applications during June 2-7,8-14, 1991 at the Philipps\u00ad University of Marburg, Germany."

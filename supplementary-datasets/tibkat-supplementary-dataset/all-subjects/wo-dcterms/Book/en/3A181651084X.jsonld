            "abstract": "\"This book is available as open access through the Bloomsbury Open Access programme and is available on www.bloomsburycollections.com. It is funded by Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS), the Netherlands. Changes occur daily in higher education institutes. Changes can be initiated by management, or evolve bottom-up, from individual academics' transforming practices. Intended changes can take place at all levels of the higher education organization: addressing the overarching structure of the organization; focusing on the culture of a specific faculty; adapting a particular curriculum to the prerequisites of a professional field or the developments in the discipline; affecting the actions of the individual lecturer, for instance through professionalization. The many layers of higher education change makes it a complex endeavour. This book focuses on the specific aim for higher educational change: to further integration of research and education. It brings together and builds upon the international bodies of knowledge on higher education change and on the relationship between research and teaching. Rather than simply combining this knowledge, this book provides a thorough understanding of change paths towards sustainable hybrid higher education organizations of research and teaching. The team explore ways in which the model can work at the different levels of the higher education organisation, providing knowledge and understanding of creating an evidence-informed direction for institutional change towards the improved connection between research and education.\"--",

            "abstract": "This book is a novel tutorial for research-oriented study of vibration mechanics. The book begins with twelve open problems from six case studies of vibration mechanics in order to guide readers in studying the entire book. Then, the book surveys both theories and methods of linear vibrations in an elementary course from a new perspective of aesthetics of science so as to assist readers to upgrade their way of learning. The successive chapters offer a theoretical frame of linear vibrations and waves, covering the models of vibration systems, the vibration analysis of discrete systems, the natural vibrations of one-dimensional structures, the natural vibrations of symmetric structures, and the waves and vibrations of one-dimensional structures. The chapters help readers solve the twelve open problems step by step during the research-oriented study. The book tries to arouse the interest of graduate students and professionals, who have learnt an elementary course of vibration mechanics of two credits, to conduct the research-oriented study and achieve a helical upgrade understanding to vibration mechanics.",

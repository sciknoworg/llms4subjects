In 2004 a new era in material science was opened: the era of graphene or, more generally, of two-dimensional materials. Graphene is the strongest and the most stretchable known material, it has the record thermal conductivity and the very high mobility of charge carriers. It demonstrates many interesting fundamental physical effects and promises a lot of applications, among which are conductive ink, terahertz transistors, ultrafast photodetectors and bendable touch screens. In 2010 Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\". The two volumes Physics and Applications of Graphene - Experiments and Physics and Applications of Graphene - Theory contain a collection of research articles reporting on different aspects of experimental and theoretical studies of this new material",

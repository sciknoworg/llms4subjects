            "abstract": "The area of personal and wireless communications is a burgeoning field. Technology advances and new frequency allocations for personal communication services (PCS) are creating numerous business and technical opportunities. It is becoming clear that an essential requirement for exploiting opportunities is the ability to track the dramatic changes in wireless technology, which is a principal aim of this book. Wireless Personal Communications: Research Developments places particular emphasis on the areas of signal processing, propagation and spread-spectrum, and emerging communication systems. This book contains new results on adaptive antennas for capacity improvements in wireless communication systems, as well as state-of-the-art information on the latest technical developments. Also included are several chapters which discuss the impact of defense conversion on the wireless industry, and related competitive issues. The six parts of the book each focus on a distinct issue in wireless communications. Part I contains several tutorial chapters on key areas in wireless communications. The first chapter is on radio wave propagation for emerging wireless personal communication systems. Chapter two contains a comprehensive study of emerging DSP-based interference rejection techniques for single channel (antenna) systems. Chapter three deals with spread spectrum wireless communications, explaining the concept of spread spectrum, modeling techniques for spread spectrum, and current applications and research issues for spread spectrum systems. Part II focuses on digital signal processing and spread spectrum, two means of creating interference and multipath robust communications. Part III concerns propagation aspects of wireless communications. Part IV discusses the performance of emerging wireless systems. Part V describes the opportunities and pitfalls of defense conversion from the perspective of several U.S. defense firms that have successfully made the transition to commercial wireless. The final section discusses a number of competitive issues regarding personal communication services",

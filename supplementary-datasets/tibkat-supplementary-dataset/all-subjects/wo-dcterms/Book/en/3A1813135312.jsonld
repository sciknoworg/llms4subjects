New sections on Materials, and Threads and Their Strength, have been added, and coverage of FEA for design analysis is now included. The 5th Edition of John H. Bickford's classic Introduction to the Design and Behavior of Bolted Joints: Non-Gasketed Joints, updated by Michael Oliver, provides a thorough guide for the design of threaded bolted joints, the tightening of threaded joints, and latest design procedures for long-term life. Sections on Materials, and Threads and their Strength, have been added, and coverage of FEA for design analysis is now included. Referencing the latest standards, this new edition combines fastener materials, explanation of how fasteners are made, and how fasteners fit together, supplementing the basic design coverage included in previous versions of this authoritative text. The book will be of interest to engineers involved in the design and testing of bolted joints\"--",

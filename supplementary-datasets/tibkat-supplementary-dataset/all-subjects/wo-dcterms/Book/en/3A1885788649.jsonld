            "title": "The Kasrils Affair : Jews and minority politics in post-apartheid South Africa",
            "abstract": "In 2001, on the heels of the disastrous Durban racism conference and the terror attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, South African cabinet minister Ronnie Kasrils launched a declaration calling on South Africans of Jewish descent to protest against Israeli policies towards the Palestinians. In so doing, he launched a furious debate within the Jewish community. The debate caused the leadership of the Jewish community to shift its political strategy, from the politics of open debate towards the politics of influence. The Jewish experience resembled that of other minorities and interest groups whose leaders came to be seen as \u2018representing government in their respective communities rather than the community addressing themselves to government\u2019, in the words of historian Hermann Giliomee. The Kasrils Affair: Jews and minority politics in post-apartheid South Africa: Documents the Kasrils declaration and its implications both for the Jewish community and South African politics in general. Places the Kasrils affair in the context of South African Jewish history and of the \u2018new antisemitism\u2019 facing Jews around the world. Gives an \u2018embedded\u2019 account of events, based on public commentary and interviews with South African Jewish leaders",

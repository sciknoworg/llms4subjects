                "\"Understand the structure, behaviour, and limitations of logic machines with this thoroughly updated third edition. Many new topics are included, such as CMOS gates, logic synthesis, logic design for emerging nanotechnologies, digital system testing, and asynchronous circuit design, to bring students up-to-speed with modern developments. The intuitive examples and minimal formalism of the previous edition are retained, giving students a text that is logical and easy to follow, yet rigorous. Kohavi and Jha begin with the basics, and then cover combinational logic design and testing, before moving on to more advanced topics in finite-state machine design and testing. Theory is made easier to understand with 200 illustrative examples, and students can test their understanding with over 350 end-of-chapter review questions\"--Provided by publisher",
                "\"Topics in switching and finite automata theory have been an important part of the curriculum in electrical engineering and computer science departments for several decades. The third edition of this book builds on the comprehensive foundation provided by the second edition and adds: significant new material in the areas of CMOS logic; modern two-level and multi-level logic synthesis methods; logic design for emerging nanotechnologies; test generation, design for testability and built-in self-test for combinational and sequential circuits; modern asynchronous circuit synthesis techniques; etc. We have attempted to maintain the comprehensive nature of the earlier edition in providing readers with an understanding of the structure, behavior, and limitations of logical machines. At the same time, we have provided an up-to-date context in which the presented techniques can find use in a variety of applications.We start with introductory material and build up to more advanced topics. Thus, the technical background assumed on the part of the reader is minimal\"--Provided by publisher",

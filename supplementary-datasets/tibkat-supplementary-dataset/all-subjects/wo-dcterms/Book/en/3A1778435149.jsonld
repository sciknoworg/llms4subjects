            "abstract": "The analysis of power systems under various conditions represents one of the most important and complex tasks in electrical power engineering. Studies in this area are necessary to ensure that the reliability, efficiency, and stability of the power system is not adversely affected. This issue is devoted to reviews and applications of modern methods of signal processing used to analyze the operation of a power system and evaluate the performance of the system in all aspects. Smart grids as an emerging research field of the current decade is the focus of this issue. Monitoring capability with data integration, advanced analysis of support system control, enhanced power security and effective communication to meet the power demand, efficient energy consumption and minimum costs, and intelligent interaction between power-generating and -consuming devices depends on the selection and implementation of advanced signal analysis and processing techniques",

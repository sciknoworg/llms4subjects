                "\"Vincent Brussee is one of the very few scholars who I regularly recommend as essential reading on China\u2019s social credit system. For years, he has remained consistently abreast of the latest developments in this complicated and evolving area, and his writing has helped to dispel the fog of misinformation that surrounds the subject in popular media.\" --Jeremy Daum, Senior Research Fellow, Paul Tsai China Center, Yale University School of Law \"China\u2019s Social Credit System has been a source for fanciful speculation and gratuitous mythmaking. How does it actually work in practice? This book provides a rigorous and detailed review of the system\u2019s historical evolution, its structuring, and its functionality and dysfunctionality. It provides a useful corrective to dominant narratives, as well as a fascinating insight into governance reform in China.\" - Rogier Creemers, Assistant Professor at Leiden University China\u2019s Social Credit System has fundamentally re-shaped of surveillance worldwide, with discussions of it making it into hundreds of media headlines and all the way into European Union legislation and the United Nations. Social Credit offers one of the first comprehensive assessments of this infamous system. It is aimed at the many experts and professionals \u2013 both scholarly and more broadly \u2013 that have to deal with its fallout on a regular basis. In a concise format, it covers the questions that have garnered the most attention worldwide: from social credit scoring and blacklists to its history and theoretical foundation. Throughout, its core thesis is that more often than not, even China\u2019s government is at a loss what to do with this messy and complex initiative. This has caused fragmented and low-tech implementation, but where insufficient legal safeguards can have far-reaching implications for the normal market order and for human rights. Vincent Brussee is an Analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, Europe\u2019s largest think tank and research institute on contemporary China. He is the institute\u2019s lead researcher on the Social Credit System. In addition to publishing extensively for MERICS, his work has been featured in Foreign Policy, the Diplomat, and various national outlets in Europe. He holds a graduate degree with the highest distinction in Asian Studies from Leiden University (the Netherlands), focusing on China\u2019s domestic governance.",

            "abstract": "\"The Apple Watch is more than a timepiece and a fashion accessory. The watch is designed to be a very personal assistant, from paying for groceries or a coffee to keeping a detailed record of your daily physical activity. Author Scott McNulty has organized the book around events and activities, showing how to use the watch in various settings. The book starts off with an essential \"Apple Watch 101\" section that gets you up and running quickly. You learn the watch's gestures and presses, how to use the digital crown, and how to change the band, for example. Scott then looks at how to use the watch in different settings. At work, how to set tasks and check email. After work, how to meet up with friends, find a place to eat, and get directions. At the gym, how to monitor your workout activities and monitor your heart rate. And you don't have to be at the gym. Learn how to use the watch to track your daily physical activities, from how much you walk each time to gentle reminders to get up and move if you've been sitting too long\" --",

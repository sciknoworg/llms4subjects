                "\"Assumptions concerning iconophobia in Islam has meant that scholarship has largely failed to situate figural artworks made for South Asia's Muslim audiences within Islamic intellectual and religious histories. Artworks explored in this book were made for people shaped by Muslim devotion and ritual. Central to this story are the royal Mughal siblings, Jahanara Begum and Dara Shikoh, and their spiritual guide Mulla Shah. Among other themes, the book contextualizes artworks made for the imperial siblings by placing them next to their writings, most of which an English reading audience will encounter for the first time\"--",
                "Islamic art is often misrepresented as an iconophobic tradition. As a result of this assumption, the polyvalence of figural artworks made for South Asian Muslim audiences has remained hidden in plain view. This book situates manuscript illustrations and album paintings within cultures of devotion and ritual shaped by Islamic intellectual and religious histories. Central to this story are the Mughal siblings, Jahanara Begum and Dara Shikoh, and their Sufi guide Mulla Shah. Through detailed art historical analysis supported by new translations, this study contextualizes artworks made for Indo-Muslim patrons by putting them into direct dialogue with written testimonies"

                "This proceedings volume features selected contributions from the conference Positivity X. The field of positivity deals with ordered mathematical structures and their applications. At the biannual series of Positivity conferences, the latest developments in this diverse field are presented. The 2019 edition was no different, with lectures covering a broad spectrum of topics, including vector and Banach lattices and operators on such spaces, abstract stochastic processes in an ordered setting, the theory and applications of positive semi-groups to partial differential equations, Hilbert geometries, positivity in Banach algebras and, in particular, operator algebras, as well as applications to mathematical economics and financial mathematics. The contributions in this book reflect the variety of topics discussed at the conference. They will be of interest to researchers in functional analysis, operator theory, measure and integration theory, operator algebras, and economics. Positivity X was dedicated to the memory of our late colleague and friend, Coenraad Labuschagne. His untimely death in 2018 came as an enormous shock to the Positivity community. He was a prominent figure in the Positivity community and was at the forefront of the recent development of abstract stochastic processes in a vector lattice context.",

            "abstract": "This book is a contribution to the debate and knowledge for the rebalancing of farming and food using legumes. The main aim is to help people who are involved in developing cropping systems: the decision makers of today and today's students who are the decision makers of tomorrow. It is aimed at all relevant decision makers: farmers, professionals who support innovation in farming, and the policy community in its widest sense. It contains 13 chapters describing various aspects of the use of legumes (including grain and feed legumes) in European cropping systems. Each chapter provides deep insight into the relevant literature to support understanding rather than a comprehensive academic review. The aim is to empower the reader with insights and understanding of the underlying processes that influence cropping system development",

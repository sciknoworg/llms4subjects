                "'Douglas Janoff draws from his wide-ranging diplomatic career, extensive research and rigorous scholarship to provide a highly engaging and accessible exploration of the mainstreaming, complexities and contradictions of LGBTQ+ advocacy in contemporary Western diplomacy. Janoff's book is a much-needed addition to the expanding field of queer international relations and is a thoughtful and useful contribution both for academic scholars and diplomatic practitioners' \u2014Daniel Conway is Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations, University of Westminster, UK This book is the first study of multilateral LGBT human rights diplomacy viewed from the perspective of its practitioners: diplomats, LGBT activists, human rights experts and multilateral specialists. It demonstrates how diplomats and advocates work to promote LGBT rights on the world stage, often using Western constructs of sexual and gender identity. In turn, these efforts have triggered conflict and polarization: opposing states often deploy cultural, religious and moral discourses to minimize LGBT rights as a \u201clegitimate\u201d human right. The author, a seasoned Canadian foreign service officer, human rights negotiator and former community activist and researcher, uses insider perspectives to critically assess both bilateral and multilateral diplomatic engagement on LGBT human rights issues. Janoff\u2019s research involved participation in UN meetings in Geneva and New York and 29 interviews with diplomats, human rights advocates and experts, and representatives from the UN and other inter-governmental organizations. Although LGBT issues have been mainstreamed into many areas of bilateral and multilateral human rights policy, his research found a considerable gap: a coordinated diplomatic and civil society approach is needed to more effectively address ongoing human rights violations against LGBT people around the world. Douglas Victor Janoff was appointed to Canada\u2019s Foreign Service in 2009: his career has included diplomatic postings to Washington, D.C., Afghanistan and Pakistan. He is the author of Pink Blood: Homophobic Violence in Canada (2005) and has a PhD in Canadian Studies from Carleton University, Canada."

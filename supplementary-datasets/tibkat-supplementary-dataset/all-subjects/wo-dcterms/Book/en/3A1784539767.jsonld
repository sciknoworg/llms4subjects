            "abstract": "This book discusses the current reality and the future of ethnic Rohingyas in Myanmar. It presents Myanmar\u2019s history, \u200epolicy, politics and, most \u200eimportantly, while focusing on Rohingya ethnic conflict, presents a resolution by looking at \u200ethe global and regional policies \u200eand politics of South Asia and \u200eSouth-East Asia. The recent coup unfolded in Myanmar and the detention of the democratic \u200eleaders has surprised the \u200eworld with its subsequent emergency declaration in 2021, thus making this \u200ebook \u200erelevant and well-timed. \u200e Eventually, the book offers an account of a previously \u200elittle \u200eknown, yet much-discussed role of media, \u200einternational actors, human trafficking, \u200eand \u200ehumanitarian-based resolution for Rohingya refugee crisis. It shows a new perspective \u200ein the post-Rohingya influx era of Bangladesh and the neighbouring countries. Kudret B\u00fclb\u00fcl is a Professor of Political Science at AYBU.

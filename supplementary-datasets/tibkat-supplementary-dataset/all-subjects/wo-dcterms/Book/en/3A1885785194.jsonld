            "abstract": "Contemporary film and television production is extraordinarily mobile. Filming large-scale studio productions in Atlanta, Budapest, London, Prague, or Australia\u2019s Gold Coast makes Hollywood jobs available to people and places far removed from Southern California\u2014but it also requires individuals to uproot their lives as they travel around the world in pursuit of work. Drawing on interviews with a global contingent of film and television workers, Kevin Sanson weaves an analysis of the sheer scale and complexity of mobile production into a compelling account of the impact that mobility has had on job functions, working conditions, and personal lives. Mobile Hollywood captures how an expanded geography of production not only intensifies the often-invisible pressures that production workers now face but also stretches the parameters of screen-media labor far beyond craftwork and creativity. \u201cEngagingly written and sharply observed, Kevin Sanson\u2019s latest book\u2014firmly grounded in the experiences of film workers themselves\u2014is an invaluable contribution to the field.\u201d \u2014 JADE L.

Using these contributions from experienced researchers, most of whom are practising teachers, this single volume is international in scope and context, demonstrating differences and similarities between and within countries.        This detailed book is clearly split into five sections focusing on the following themes:        * teacher education \u2013 professional identity, professional research, and quality of teacher education  * teacher practice \u2013 basic values, ethics, and cultural scaffolding  * higher education \u2013 academic motivation, discourse dissonance concerning intellectual property, self studies of teacher education practice  * teacher development \u2013 the challenge to be the best teacher, the link between policy and practice, personal theory and practice in tertiary development  * research and theory \u2013 reflective practice, shared democratic values, teachers as researchers",

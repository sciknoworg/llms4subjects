            "abstract": [
                "This book examines the economic relationship between Africa and Europe. It highlights the stigmatized narratives about Africa and analyses how they influence a range of key actors and processes. This is illustrated by the actions of European actors who reinforce negative narratives through replacing real economic transformation and development with charity, while African leaders compete to maximize aid donations and help further these narratives. This book acknowledges the complex history of the relations between Africa and Europe and details the ways in which Africa has become a peripheral player in the world economy. It will be relevant to researchers and policymakers interested in development and African economics. This is an open access book. Carlos Lopes is a Professor at the Mandela School of Public Governance, University of Cape Town and Affiliate Professor at Sciences Po, Paris. He has occupied important leadership positions across the United Nations, the African Union, and academic institutions.",

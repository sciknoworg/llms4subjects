                "As control systems become more complex and are expected to perform tasks in unknown and extreme environments, they may be subject to various types of faults in their sensors, actuators or other components. It is crucial to be able to diagnose the occurrence of faults and to repair them in order to maintain, guarantee, and improve the overall safety, reliability, and performance of the systems. This book addresses the design challenges of developing and implementing novel integrated fault diagnosis and control technologies for complex linear systems. Integrated Fault Diagnosis and Control Design of Linear Complex Systems considers linear time-invariant (LTI) systems under both time- and event-triggered frameworks. The book initially develops novel methodologies for the problem of integrated fault diagnosis and control of LTI systems to address current design challenges. The results obtained are then extended to a number of complex linear systems, specifically to Markovian jump systems as well as to cooperative multi-agent systems"

            "title": "Chapter 13 Stalinism, War, and Artistic Representation of Reality : Konstantin Simonov\u2019s Critique of the \u2018System of Silence\u2019 in 1956",
            "abstract": "This chapter analyses Konstantin Simonov\u2019s thought from the largely understudied point of view of de-Stalinization. Simonov showed already in 1956 how the representation of the Great Patriotic war was tightly intertwined with the personality cult of Stalin, and how this entanglement had caused literature and art either to portray Soviet reality in a distorted manner or to keep silent about social difficulties. By criticizing key authoritative documents of the early post-war years, Simonov revealed how Stalin\u2019s wish to forge the image of the Great Patriotic war resulted in the widespread tendency of embellishing reality in Soviet literature and art. The chapter also tracks how the Party rebuked Simonov\u2019s claims without mentioning him as the initiator of the ideas. The chapter thus testifies to some of the problems of \u2018de-Stalinization\u2019 and how some of its key issues could not be openly discussed in the Soviet Union until the late 1980s. The chapter is based on previously untapped archival material, and it contributes to the scholarly discussion of the thaw-era de-Stalinization, Simonov\u2019s roles within the Soviet literary establishment, and questions of the representation of reality in Soviet art in general and the representation of the Great Patriotic war in particular",

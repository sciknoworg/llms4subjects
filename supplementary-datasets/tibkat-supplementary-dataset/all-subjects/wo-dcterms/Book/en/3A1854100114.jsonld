            "title": "An introduction to transport phenomena in materials engineering",
            "abstract": "\"An Introduction to Transport Phenomena in Materials Engineering elucidates the important role of conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer, mass transport in solids and fluids, and internal and external fluid flow in the behavior of materials processes. These phenomena are critical in materials engineering because of the connection of transport to the evolution and distribution of microstructural properties during processing. From making choices in derivation of fundamental conservation equations, to using scaling (order-of-magnitude) analysis showing relationships among different phenomena, to giving examples of how to represent real systems by simple models, the book takes the reader through the fundamentals of transport phenomena applied to materials processing. Fully updated, this Third Edition of a classic textbook offers a significant shift from the previous editions in the approach to this subject, representing an evolution incorporating the original ideas and extending them to a more comprehensive approach to the topic. The text: introduces order of magnitude (scaling) analysis and uses it to quickly obtain approximate solutions for complicated problems throughout the book, focuses on building models to solve practical problems, adds new sections on non-Newtonian flows, turbulence, and measurement of heat transfer coefficients and offers expanded sections on thermal resistance networks, transient heat transfer, two-phase diffusion mass transfer, and flow in porous media. Additional features: more homework problems, mostly on the analysis of practical problems, and new examples from a much broader range of materials classes and processes, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and electronic materials, includes homework problems for the review of the mathematics required for a course based on this book and connects the theory represented by mathematics with real-world problems. This text is aimed at advanced engineering undergraduates and students early in their graduate studies, as well as practicing engineers interested in understanding the behavior of heat and mass transfer and fluid flow during materials processing. While it is designed primarily for materials engineering education, it is a good reference for practicing materials engineers looking for insight into phenomena controlling their processes. A solutions manual, lectures slides, and figure slides are available for qualifying adopting professors\"--",

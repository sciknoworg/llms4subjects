                "Family businesses are everywhere, but there is little information regarding their growth and development. This book is one of the few to analyses the identity and evolution of the largest family businesses in Latin America and Spain. With contributions from 20 scholars from 12 different countries, the book compares the relationship of families in business within their national economies, foreign capital, migration, and politics. The authors deny the existence of a 'Latin type' of family capitalism in their countries, and highlight diversity, and national and regional differences. This interdisciplinary book will be useful for students and scholars of economics, management, history, sociology, and anthropology. Politicians, family business consultants, family businesses, and international institutions will also benefit from insights within this book.

                "Attention .NET developers who no longer want to use JavaScript for your front end. Quickly and efficiently learn how to use C# for your single-page application (SPA) thanks to Blazor. Today\u2019s reality is that most modern applications are web-based and if you want the same user experience as a desktop application, you need to be able to create a single-page application. While there are multiple frameworks and libraries to choose from (including Angular, React, and VueJS), you still need to know how to code in JavaScript. But now there is another option from Microsoft. Blazor is an open-source framework that enables developers to create web applications using C# and HTML, and everything you need to get started is covered in this guide. You will learn the steps, through build-along coding examples, that will allow you to use the same language for both the front end and the back end of your application. This book is designed to get you comfortable creating a single-page application in the shortest time possible. Get ready to create a complete business application that teaches and reinforces the skills you need in a Blazor production environment. What You Will Learn Develop the front end of an application using C# and .NET Core Use this quick-start for .NET developers who need to improve their application with a single-page front end Take a code-first approach that models an actual business application Gain insights for developing a high-functioning and maintainable application Study guidance on repurposing your .NET skill set This book is for C# and .NET developers who have some experience in web development. Michele Aponte is a programmer working with Java, .NET, and JavaScript at software and IT consulting companies in his native Italy since 1993. Combining his training, consulting, and development skills, in 2013 Michele founded \u201cBlexin\u201d to help customers migrate older software and systems to new technologies in order to improve their businesses. Passionate about programming, Michele embraces sharing with the community. He founded DotNetCampania, a Microsoft User Group in 2008, and has organized many regional conferences. Recognized as a Microsoft MVP, he often presents on Microsoft and JavaScript topics at tech conferences throughout Italy.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in mechanical engineering are an essential topic for discussion. The topics relating to mechanical engineering include the following: measurements of signals of shafts, springs, belts, bearings, gears, rotors, machine elements, vibration analysis, acoustic analysis, fault diagnosis, construction, analysis of machine operation, analysis of smart-material systems, integrated systems, stresses, analysis of deformations, analysis of mechanical properties, signal processing of mechanical systems, and rotor dynamics. Mechanical engineering deals with solid and fluid mechanics, rotation, movements, materials, and thermodynamics. This book, with 15 published articles, presents the topic \u201cSymmetry in Mechanical Engineering\u201d. The presented topic is interesting. It is categorized into eight different sections: Deformation; Stresses; Mechanical properties; Tribology; Thermodynamic; Measurement; Fault diagnosis; Machine. The development of techniques and methods related to mechanical engineering is growing every month. The described articles have made a contribution to mechanical engineering. The proposed research can find applications in factories, oil refineries, and mines. It is essential to develop new improved methods, techniques, and devices related to mechanical engineering",

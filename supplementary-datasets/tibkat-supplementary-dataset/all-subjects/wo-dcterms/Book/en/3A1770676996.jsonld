            "abstract": "\"Renewable Energy and Green Technology: Principles and Practices emerge as per the present need to understand the principles and utility of renewable energy and green technology to minimize dependency on fossil fuels in global development. Renewable energy is the best and cheap source of energy as an alternate resource. There is a massive potential for renewable energy globally, including in India. The efficient utilization of renewable energy resources could minimize the impact of climate change globally. Generally, renewable energy is generated from essentially inexhaustible sources, including wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal energy, biomass energy, etc. Hence, encouraging renewable energy uses could save our tomorrow from the climate change perspective and sustainable food production. This book promotes the exchange of ideas, policy formulation, and collective action to ensure a smooth transition to renewable energy. This book describes the technological interventions for reducing environmental and economic damage resulting from the use of conventional energy sources. In this book, the focus has been given to utilizing various renewable energy sources in diverse sectors. It also elaborates the descriptive methodology of different renewable energies, accompanied by figures and tables. It includes biogas energy plant, gasifier technologies, and hydropower technologies, etc, with their application. Further, it contains information for understanding energy concepts and significant advantages of the energy resources for sustaining the future world. Lastly, this book will provide instant access to comprehensive, cutting-edge knowledge, making it possible for academicians and researchers to utilize this ever-growing wealth of information. Key features The book emphasizes the understanding principles and utility of renewable energy and green technology to minimize dependency on fossil fuels in the era of global development. The book focused on recent trends in renewable energy with principles and practices in relation to climate change This book highlighted advanced approaches for sustainable use of renewable energy sources The methodology for various aspect of renewable energy are illustrated with figures and charts Uses of agriculture and forestry sector as a green technology are also illustrated/mentioned This book potentially will helpful for policymakers in the field of renewable energy\"--",

            "abstract": "\"Cutting through the mass of technical literature on machine learning and AI and the plethora of fear-mongering books on the rise of killer robots, Secrets of Machine Learning offers a clear-sighted explanation for the informed reader of what this new technology is, what it does, how it works, and why it's so important. The surge in computer processing power along with the sheer quantities of training data available, means machine learning is now possible in ways wholly unthinkable just five years ago. Computers can recognize potential lung cancer better than doctors, detect fraud better than bankers, and create fake video almost impossible to tell from the real thing. And next, they are likely to drive our cars. Journalist and news product manager Tom Kohn gets to the heart of the revolutionary new technology that is developing all around us, explaining with precision how the different facets of machine learning work, how companies are using it, and why it is permeating all parts of society right now. The book guides readers through the arcane science and jargon in a clear and understandable way, but is detailed enough that it doesn't gloss over the hard technical concepts. If you want to know why Siri sometimes misunderstands you, how Netflix recommends your movies, and how machine learning will affect your job - read this book\"--",

            "abstract": "\"The transformative power of urban design in shaping our experiences within high-rise cities takes center stage in 'Humanizing the High-Rise City: Podiums, Plazas, Parks, Pedestrian Networks, and Public Art.' This captivating exploration delves into the art of turning towering skyscraper cities into vibrant havens that foster human connection, celebrate culture, and build communities. Unveiling the secrets behind the creation of urban spaces, from dynamic plazas that encourage social interaction to tranquil parks that infuse life into steel and glass, the book unfolds a narrative that resonates with the innate rhythms of humanity. Examining 20 major high-rise cities worldwide (including Chicago, New York City, Dubai, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore, among others), synthesizing extensive literature, and enriched with over 200 photographs, this book showcases projects seamlessly weaving nature, art, and connectivity into the urban fabric. These endeavors craft environments that enhance well-being and instill a profound sense of belonging amid the challenges of urban density. As the global landscape increasingly tilts toward vertical living, this book serves as a guiding light, illuminating the path to a heightened and enriched experience of high-rise urban living. This book will be useful to practitioners and students of architecture, urban planning, and urban design interested in improving high rise cities\"--",

            "abstract": "This volume deals with the children\u2019s socialization on the Trobriands. After a survey of ethnographic studies on childhood, the book zooms in on indigenous ideas of conception and birth-giving, the children\u2019s early development, their integration into playgroups, their games and their education within their `own little community\u2019 until they reach the age of seven years. During this time children enjoy much autonomy and independence. Attempts of parental education are confined to a minimum. However, parents use subtle means to raise their children. Educational ideologies are manifest in narratives and in speeches addressed to children. They provide guidelines for their integration into the Trobrianders\u2019 \u201cbalanced society\u201d which is characterized by cooperation and competition. It does not allow individual accumulation of wealth \u2013 surplus property gained has to be redistributed \u2013 but it values the fame acquired by individuals in competitive rituals. Fame is not regarded as threatening the balance of their society",

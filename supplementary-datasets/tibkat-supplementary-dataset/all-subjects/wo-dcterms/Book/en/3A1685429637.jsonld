            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Molecular Physical Chemistry: A Concise Introduction focuses on two main aspects of physical chemistry: thermodynamics and reaction dynamics. By looking at the properties of the atoms and molecules that constitute matter, it makes use of results from modern experiments conducted on small numbers of molecules. These molecular properties allow the behaviour of larger groups of molecules to be predicted. This is in contrast to conventional approaches which are based upon how the subjects have developed historically. It attempts to show how some basic concepts can be easily applied to give verifiable results in simple systems before extending them to more complicated scenarios. The text is intended as an aid to understanding these central topics of physical chemistry, rather than an introduction to them, and some familiarity with them is assumed throughout. Worked examples and problems are given at the end of each chapter. Molecular Physical Chemistry: A Concise Introduction will be welcomed by graduate and advanced undergraduate students, as well as lecturers. Upon completion of this book the reader will see its subject matter as an integral part of their whole approach to chemistry.  \"Professor McLauchlin is certainly owed a debt of gratitude by the chemical community for this effort to bring enjoyment and understanding to the future generation. It will be interesting to see if this experiment helps students replace the fear of physical chemistry by an appreciation of its power and beauty.\" Professor William Klemperer, University of Harvard",

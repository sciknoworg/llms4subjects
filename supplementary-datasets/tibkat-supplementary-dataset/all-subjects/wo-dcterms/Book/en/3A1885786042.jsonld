            "abstract": "The aim of this work is to illustrate the main intercultural communicative problems which could arise in the interactions between Italians on the one side and Bosnians, Croatians, Montenegrins and Serbs (who will also be referred to as South Slavs or Slavs from the South) on the other. The general field of research of this study \u2013 the intercultural communication \u2013 allows us to shed light on aspects which could influence more than morphological or syntactic errors the success of interactions between speakers who do not share the same mother tongue and culture. The communications involving interlocutors belonging to different \u2018worlds\u2019 can lead, as a matter of fact, to negative consequences on the interaction and on the relationship between the speakers, if and when they do not take sufficiently into account certain cultural aspects, such as the values guiding the speakers in the communication, the use of verbal and non-verbal languages, and the way in which some cultural traits are conceived. Therefore, it is necessary for each speaker to consider and analise carefully the main aspects which could give rise to intercultural communicative misunderstandings or even conflicts with their interlocutor so as to reduce the risks of the above-mentioned situations arising",

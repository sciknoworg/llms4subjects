            "abstract": "In recent decades, the field of computational fluid dynamics has made significant advances in enabling advanced computing architectures to understand many phenomena in biological, geophysical, and engineering fluid flows. Almost all research areas in fluids use numerical methods at various complexities: from molecular to continuum descriptions; from laminar to turbulent regimes; from low speed to hypersonic, from stencil-based computations to meshless approaches; from local basis functions to global expansions, as well as from first-order approximation to high-order with spectral accuracy. Many successful efforts have been put forth in dynamic adaptation strategies, e.g., adaptive mesh refinement and multiresolution representation approaches. Furthermore, with recent advances in artificial intelligence and heterogeneous computing, the broader fluids community has gained the momentum to revisit and investigate such practices. This Special Issue, containing a collection of 13 papers, brings together researchers to address recent numerical advances in fluid mechanics",

                "\"Promoting more responsible action in relation to business sustainability, this book addresses the increasing discomfort among faculty members and wider society as to how business schools prepare students for the future. Reflective and inspiring, it seeks to motivate the necessary action which may be a small but crucial catalysts to solving challenges posed by increasing globalisation, migration, economic development, changing demographics, and cultural exchange. Split into four thematic sections, chapters throughout explore the global issues that have simultaneously fuelled business opportunities while creating new challenges for sustainability. The book begins with a fresh perspective on the sustainability challenges posed by dysfunctional capitalism, before addressing central challenges for sustainable human resource management and psycho-social working life issues. It moves on to look at efforts to incorporate a responsible and sustainable perspective on business management. Finally, outlining the key sustainable challenges in teaching, research and innovation, it evaluates how business schools are managing the expectation to adopt a responsible and sustainable business perspective in research, course designs and teaching. Speaking to the growing call for business schools to prioritise sustainable, ethical practices, this book will be essential reading for lecturers, practitioners and scholars engaging with sustainable solutions to environmental concerns related to business, geography, urban planning, policy and management\"--",

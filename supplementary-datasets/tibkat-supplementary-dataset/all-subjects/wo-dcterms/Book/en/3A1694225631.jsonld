                "\"Welding Metallurgy by Sindo Kou has been used worldwide as a reference book for welding practitioners and researchers since it was published in 1987. The third edition provides many updated features including a simple criterion for predicting effect of filler metals on liquation cracking, an index and analytical equations for predicting susceptibility to solidification cracking, a test for evaluating susceptibility to solidification cracking and filler-metal effect, and more. New topics touched on by the author include weldability of magnesium alloys, friction stir welding, and transport phenomena such as surfactant effect on flow oscillation, metal-vapor effect on arc temperature and weld shape, and spatter\"",
                "Undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers and mechanical engineers will all benefit spectacularly from this comprehensive resource.The new edition includes new theories/methods of Kou and coworkers regarding:\u00b7 Predicting the effect of filler metals on liquation cracking\u00b7 An index and analytical equations for predicting susceptibility to solidification cracking\u00b7 A test for susceptibility to solidification cracking and filler-metal effect\u00b7 Liquid-metal quenching during welding\u00b7 Mechanisms of resistance of stainless steels to solidification cracking and ductility-dip cracking\u00b7 Mechanisms of macrosegregation\u00b7 Mechanisms of spatter of aluminum and magnesium filler metals,\u00b7 Liquation and cracking in dissimilar-metal friction stir welding,\u00b7 Flow-induced deformation and oscillation of weld-pool surface and ripple formation\u00b7 Multicomponent/multiphase diffusion bondingDr.-",
                "Discover the extraordinary progress that welding metallurgy has experienced over the last two decadesWelding Metallurgy, 3rd Edition is the only complete compendium of recent, and not-so-recent, developments in the science and practice of welding metallurgy. Written by Dr. Sindo Kou, this edition covers solid-state welding as well as fusion welding, which now also includes resistance spot welding. It restructures and expands sections on Fusion Zones and Heat-Affected Zones. The former now includes entirely new chapters on microsegregation, macrosegregation, ductility-dip cracking, and alloys resistant to creep, wear and corrosion, as well as a new section on ternary-alloy solidification. The latter now includes metallurgy of solid-state welding. Partially Melted Zones are expanded to include liquation and cracking in friction stir welding and resistance spot welding.-",
                "New chapters on topics of high current interest are added, including additive manufacturing, dissimilar-metal joining, magnesium alloys, and high-entropy alloys and metal-matrix nanocomposites.Dr. Kou provides the reader with hundreds of citations to papers and articles that will further enhance the reader's knowledge of this voluminous topic."

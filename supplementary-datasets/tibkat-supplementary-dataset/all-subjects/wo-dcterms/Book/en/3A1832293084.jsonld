            "abstract": "This chronological listing of more than 400 separate pieces and movements presents in practical and convenient form essential information about each of Bart\u00f3k's piano works: the year of publication, the various editions in which it has been published, its timing, the level of difficulty from both a technical and an interpretive standpoint, and bibliographical references to it. To this basic material David Yeomans adds pertinent quotations from Bart\u00f3k and other authorities, a discussion of the original folk material when applicable, a musical analysis, suggestions for performance, and an analysis of Bart\u00f3k's own recordings of the work if available. Appendixes contain listings of Bart\u00f3k's solo piano works in order of technical and musical difficulty the major publishers of his works, editions and transcriptions by Bart\u00f3k of other composers' works, and teaching editions and collections of Bart\u00f3k's piano music. Teachers, students, and professional performers will find this comprehensive listing invaluable in planning courses of study and concerts",

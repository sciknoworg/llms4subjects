            "abstract": "\"Bioelectronics and Medical Devices: Applications and Technology provides an abundance of information on new applications being used today for biomedical applications. The book covers a wide range of concepts and technologies used in biomedical applications, discussing such modern technological methods as the Internet of Things, e-pills, biomedical sensors, support vector machines, wireless devices, image and signal processing in e-health, and machine learning. It also discusses the different types of antennas, including antennas using RF energy harvesting for biomedical applications. This book contains three chapters on the various kinds of antennas used for biomedical applications, which make this book unique as this information is not generally discussed in the field of biomedical engineering. It also includes a discussion on software implementation for the devices used in biomedical applications, of course. Key features: Provides in-depth information on the major topics in real-life biomedical applications. Considers both theoretical as well as experimental approaches Topics include: The Internet of Things for health care and monitoring Antennas for biomedical applications using RF energy harvesting Biomedical sensors Software fault proneness with support vector machine biomedical applications Image and signal processing in e-health applications E-pill for biomedical applications Machine learning implementation in bioinformatics This book will be valuable for undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD students working in the biomedical application field. It will also be beneficial for scientists and medical professionals who are interested in the latest biomedical technologies being used today\"--",

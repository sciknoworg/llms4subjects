Highlighting the challenges and difficulties in implementing IoT and cloud technology in the healthcare field, the volume focuses on theories, systems, methods, algorithms, and applications. The chapters showcase the interface between e-health and communication technologies and their beneficial contribution to building efficient and secure healthcare information systems. Healthcare information systems involve data generation, compilation, arrangement, examination and synthesis, and communication and use. This incorporates frameworks that gather, store, maintain, and protect patients' electronic medical information and records, providing an invaluable resource for supporting medical services strategies and choices. IoT and Cloud Computing-Based Healthcare Information Systems discusses a multitude of diverse new information technologies in telemedicine, in security for healthcare systems, for medical image authentication, in pulse oximetry via Bluetooth, for virus detection via smartphones, for tumor extraction via extreme learning machine and k-means clustering, for detect cancerous cells, for music therapy for mental health purposes, and much more. This informative volume will be a valuable resource for academicians, professionals, engineers, technology designers, analysts, and students involved in the various fields that are involved with information technology and biomedical engineering in healthcare and medicine\"--",

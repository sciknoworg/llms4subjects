            "abstract": "Biofiltration is a technology of great interest since the costs of installation and, above all, exploitation costs are much lower than those associated with other technologies based on physical\u2013chemical processes. Nowadays, the use of biofiltration is increasing every day. On the other hand, the physicochemical filtration process is a successful technology in numerous applications in the field of water treatment. This issue of the journal is focused on the treatment of different types of effluents through filtration: Drinking water and wastewater. Different technologies are analysed: Filtration through biochar from agricultural by-products; biological active carbon (BAC); electroadsorption using a commercial granular activated carbon as the adsorbent; filtration through sand, anthracite and expanded clay; granular activated carbon (GAC) as part of a tertiary treatment for wastewater reuse",

This book summarizes the recent progress of bio-based technologies for environmental remediation at both an experimental and a theoretical model level. An emphasis has been made on trends and probable future of the sustainable techniques to reduce the waste and harmful compounds from the environment. Biological based technologies have low operating costs and involve direct degradation of organic pollutants, without release of the toxic intermediates. Recent applications covered in this book include Process Intensification in Bio-Based Approaches, Green technology, Phytoremediation, Biopolymer, Biosurfactant for environmental applications, other bio-based technologies with sustainable design and future of remediation are also discussed. Innovative Bio-Based Technologies for Environmental Remediation is an important reference source for environmental scientists and engineers who are seeking to improve their understanding of how bio-based technologies are playing an increasingly important role in environmental remediation. This book: Brings together recent innovations and practices of bio-based technologies for environmental Remediation Outlines major Bio-Based Technologies Contains both practical and theoretical latest and broad aspects of environment management through bio-based innovative technology\"--",

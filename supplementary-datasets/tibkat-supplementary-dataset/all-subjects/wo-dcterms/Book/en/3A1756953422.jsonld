            "abstract": "This book looks at the changing continuum that links individuals, communities and society. An outline of Aspirational Algorithms (AA) and Valuable Wearables is presented as tools to shift from an AI culture to the cultivation of Augmented Humanity (AH). The human mindset that is behind the design and use of technology determines the outcomes of technology. If the intended outcome is the common good, then the preceding human aspiration must be geared toward that goal. Only technology that is conceived with the aspiration of a society that lifts individuals to fulfill their potential can be a game-changer for good. Seeing the constant interplay between the four levels of human existence \u2013 soul, heart, mind, body, expressed as aspirations, emotions, thoughts and sensations, how technology may serve to systematically sway individuals from inspiration to desire, from informing to the ignition of tangible transformation. This transition is explained in the book along the scale of influence. Two convergent and mutually influencing dynamics are analyzed: first, the influence of values and aspirations on the impact of technology, and second, the influence of technology on the attitude and action of users. Both assess how hardware and software can serve a maximum of people to live a meaningful happy life. Cornelia C. Walther\u2019s experience combines practice and research.

            "abstract": "Splines provide a significant tool for the design of computationally economical curves and surfaces for the construction of various objects like automobiles, ship hulls, airplane fuselages and wings, propeller blades, shoe insoles, bottles, etc. It also contributes in the description of geological, physical, statistical, and even medical phenomena. Spline methods have proven to be indispensable in a variety of modern industries, including computer vision, robotics, signal and image processing, visualization, textile, graphic designs, and even media. This book aims to provide a valuable source on splines and their applications. It focuses on collecting and disseminating information in various disciplines including computer-aided geometric design, computer graphics, data visualization, data fitting, power systems, clinical and epidemiologic studies, disease detection, regression curves, social media, and biological studies. The book is useful for researchers, scientists, practitioners, and many others who seek state-of-the-art techniques and applications using splines. It is also useful for undergraduate senior students as well as graduate students in the areas of computer science, engineering, health science, statistics, and mathematics. Each chapter also provides useful information on software developments and their extensions",

            "abstract": "This book collects the proceedings of the conference \u201cNbS-Nature-based Solutions for the architecture and the city. Performance oriented approach to vegetative systems \u2013 2023 Conference\u201d which was held on 13th October 2023 at the Iuav University of Venice. The conference program was focused in the quantification of the NbS benefits, called ecosystem services, referring to the oriented performance approach typical of construction technologies applied to NbS (for this reason defined here as vegetated technologies). The conference was divided into four themes: (1) hydrological management urban, (2) biodiversity and eco-system services, (3) impacts on the microclimate urban and thermal benefits, (4) management, maintenance and water needs of vegetation. The speakers conveyed the complexity around the research and the implementation of NbS, thanks to the different disciplinary backgrounds (architects, engineers, agronomists, naturalists, biologists) and professionals (researchers, designers, managers of public heritage, producers). The essays have been rich in knowledge and experiences, highlighting inter-disciplinary as well as multi-scalar approaches. The results are collected in this open-access book in order to make the more disseminated the contributions presented by the speakers and the technical-scientific knowledge of Nature-based Solutions",

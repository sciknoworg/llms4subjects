            "abstract": "Dive into the intricate realm of osteoporosis through the lens of biomechanics with Biomechanical Insights into Osteoporosis. This pioneering volume offers a comprehensive exploration of this debilitating condition, providing an in-depth understanding of its biomechanical foundations and implications. Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density and heightened susceptibility to fractures, stands as a global health challenge. This book brings together leading experts in the field, who rigorously analyze the multifaceted aspects of osteoporosis, offering invaluable knowledge for researchers, clinicians, and students alike. Key Highlights: Biomechanical Foundations: Gain profound insights into the biomechanical basis of bone fractures and fracture osteosynthesis in small animals. Explore the fundamental principles that shape our understanding of osteoporotic biomechanics. Non-Glucocorticoid Drug-Induced Osteoporosis: Investigate the mechanisms, risk factors, and therapeutic approaches for osteoporosis induced by medications other than glucocorticoids. Vascular Remodeling and Bone Destruction: Discover the common pathogenetic links between vascular remodeling and bone tissue destruction in postmenopausal women with arterial hypertension. This holistic perspective illuminates bone health dynamics. Genetic Targets and Future Directions: Explore promising genetic targets that have the potential to revolutionize osteoporosis treatment. Get a glimpse into the future of research and treatment strategies. Biomarkers and Metabolism: Delve into the latest research progress surrounding bone mineral density and bone metabolism biomarkers, offering valuable insights into diagnostics and monitoring. Impact of Diseases and Medical Treatments: Understand the intricate interplay between diseases and medical treatments on bone mineral density. Gain a comprehensive understanding of how various factors influence skeletal health. This book represents a significant milestone in deciphering the complexities of osteoporosis from a biomechanical perspective. Join us in this scientific journey to explore the fascinating facets of osteoporosis. Biomechanical Insights into Osteoporosis is an essential resource for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of this critical health issue and the biomechanical aspects that underlie it",

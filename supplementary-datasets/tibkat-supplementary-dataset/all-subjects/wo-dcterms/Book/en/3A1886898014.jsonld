            "abstract": "\"The Engineering Science of Mineral Processing: A Fundamental and Practical Approach emphasizes the fundamentals of mineral processing to provide readers with a deep understanding of the science and phenomena that occur during the processing of ores. It also offers guidance on contemporary process implementation for improve sustainability through practical industry applications. It includes examples of dynamic simulations and practical execution of advanced software to guide operating plans to ensure optimal conditions that predict process constraints. - Focuses on the science of mineral processing, including particulate systems, hydrodynamics, and physical chemistry. - Discusses modeling, rheology, comminution, classification, flotation, and solid-liquid separation. - Includes practical examples from real-world industrial applications. - Provides information on dynamic process simulations and the application of digital twins in mineral processing plants to improve management, toward the eco efficient processing of ores. - Details the future of mineral processing in the digital era. Offering a balance between fundamentals and applications, this book will be of interest to researchers and industry professionals working to optimize mining, mineral and chemical processing plants. It will also be of value to advanced students taking mineral processing and chemical engineering courses\"--",

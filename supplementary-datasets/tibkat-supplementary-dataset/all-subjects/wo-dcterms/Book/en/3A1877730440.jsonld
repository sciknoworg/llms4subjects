Thus, this book is composed of three different general sections: (1) Viticulture and Environmental Conditions, (2) Wine Production and Characterization, and (3) Economic Analysis and Valorization of Wine Products. Inside these 3 general sections, 16 different chapters provide current research on different topics of recent advances on production, processing, analysis, and valorization of grapes and wines. All chapters are written by a group of international researchers, in order to provide up-to-date reviews, overviews, and summaries of current research on the different dimensions of grape and wine production. This book is not only intended for technicians actively engaged in the field but also for students attending technical schools and/or universities and other professionals that might be interested in reading and learning about some fascinating areas of grape and wine research",

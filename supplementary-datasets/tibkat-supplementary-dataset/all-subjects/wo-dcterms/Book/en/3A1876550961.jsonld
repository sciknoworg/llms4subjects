            "abstract": "The Russian government has always regarded gas as a strategic resource that can be used to advance its political goals, both domestically and internationally. In particular, the Kremlin has used its national gas champion Gazprom as the the main tool for supplying domestic consumers in remote areas. Indeed, until recently, the firm held the exclusive rights to export natural gas (in whatever form) to international markets. However, in the last few years, substantial changes have taken place within the Russian gas sector, and as a result Gazprom has lost ground at home as well as abroad. The fact that the non-Gazprom gas companies succeeded in their active lobbying campaign reveals one of two things: either Gazprom and the Russian government have differing views about the future of the company and of the Russian gas sector in general, or the emerging competitors have top-level political backing that supports the development of 'independent' gas companies. Accordingly, this change has left the future of the Russian gas market unclear: should we anticipate a more liberalized domestic market as well as liberalized export policies of natural gas, or will Gazprom remain the dominant force both at home and abroad in the near- and medium-term future?",

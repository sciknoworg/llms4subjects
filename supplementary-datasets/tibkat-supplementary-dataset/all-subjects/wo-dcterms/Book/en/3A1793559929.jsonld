If you want to master something, teach it.\" - Yogi Bhajan The memorable experiences of my architectural career are many, and one of the most rewarding was co-leading three separate classes of Gensler University (GU), the global design firm's accelerated leadership development program. In addition to collaborative workshops, office visits, and virtual meetings, students of each class heard from influential speakers that included clients, consultants, educators, and researchers. Today, most of those GU graduates are leading Gensler offices or their own firms. Helping others achieve success has been central to my leadership roles at multiple design firms and served as motivation for writing this book. Recent events provided additional encouragement. Here in the US, we are finally confronting the lingering discrimination in our society and our shared responsibility to address it. But the architecture profession has much more work to do. The nation's largest minority-owned architecture firm, Moody Nolan, was appropriately recognized in 2021 with the AIA Architecture Firm Award. Of the ten firms recognized between 2011 and 2020, however, over two-thirds of the Principals still leading those firms are white men.\"--",

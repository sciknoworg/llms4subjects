            "abstract": "Aga Khan Award for Architecture 2019 - The Aga Khan Award for Architecture is one of the most prestigious and renowned awards for architecture worldwide. Since 1980 the Award has been given every three years to projects that combine social and ecological aspects and translate them into innovative and exemplary design. The Award seeks to identify and encourage building concepts that successfully address the needs and aspirations of societies across the world, in which Muslims have a significant presence. This publication presents the shortlist of the 2017\u20132019 award cycle. From a group of almost 400, 20 projects have been shortlisted by the Master Jury and evaluated by an expert group of technical reviewers. Some of these projects have been honoured with the Aga Khan Award. In addition to detailed descriptions of all projects, this book gathers a series of personal statements from the members of the Steering Committee and the Award\u2019s Master Jury on key issues that were crucial in the discussions for the final selection and assignment of the award recipients. Assembled together, this book presents a selection of the outstanding examples of sustainable and socially relevant architecture in the world today and opens up fundamental perspectives for the planning of the future.",

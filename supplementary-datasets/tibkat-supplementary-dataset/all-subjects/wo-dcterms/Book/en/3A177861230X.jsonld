            "abstract": "Family Experiments explores the forms and undertakings of \u2018family\u2019 that prevailed among British professionals who migrated to Australia and New Zealand in the late nineteenth century. Their attempts to establish and define \u2018family\u2019 in Australasian, suburban environments reveal how the Victorian theory of \u2018separate spheres\u2019 could take a variety of forms in the new world setting. The attitudes and assumptions that shaped these family experiments may be placed on a continuum that extends from John Ruskin\u2019s concept of evangelical motherhood to John Stuart Mill\u2019s rational secularism. Central to their thinking was a belief in the power of education to produce civilised and humane individuals who, as useful citizens, would individually and in concert nurture a better society. Such ideas pushed them to the forefront of colonial liberalism. The pursuit of higher education for their daughters merged with and, in some respects, influenced first-wave colonial feminism. They became the first generation of colonial, middle-class parents to grapple not only with the problem of shaping careers for their sons but also, and more frustratingly, what graduate daughters might do next",

            "abstract": "Who are the dominant owners of US public debt? Is it widely held, or concentrated in the hands of a few? Does ownership of public debt give these bondholders power over our government? What do we make of the fact that foreign-owned debt has ballooned to nearly 50 percent today? Until now, we have not had any satisfactory answers to these questions. Public Debt, Inequality, and Power is the first comprehensive historical analysis of public debt ownership in the United States. It reveals that ownership of federal bonds has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the 1 percent over the past three decades. Based on extensive and original research, Public Debt, Inequality, and Power will shock and enlighten.  \u201cThese days, the topic of America\u2019s debt stirs heated political debate. But one of the most important facts in this discussion has hitherto been obscured: who actually owns that debt inside America? Hager has done some fascinating and pathbreakingresearch to answer that question and concluded that the ownership pattern is surprisingly concentrated\u2014and unequal\u2014and that this may have implications for how the entire debt debate develops in the coming years. This is an illuminating work that deserves wide attention.\u201d  -GILLIAN TETT, Financial Times  \u201cThe relationship between the ownership structure of government debt and economic inequality\u2014between public finance and the class structure of modern capitalism\u2014is one of several central concerns of political economy that has been almost completely neglected in recent decades. Sandy Brian Hager\u2019s book returns to the subject with theoretical and empirical bravado.\u201d  -WOLFGANG STREECK, Director Emeritus, Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies  \u201cMoney is power, and US Treasury debt is the world\u2019s single largest financial instrument. Hager\u2019s insightful book fills an enormous hole in our knowledge of who owns this debt and how the power flowing from that increasingly concentrated ownership affects US and global politics.\u201d  -HERMAN M.

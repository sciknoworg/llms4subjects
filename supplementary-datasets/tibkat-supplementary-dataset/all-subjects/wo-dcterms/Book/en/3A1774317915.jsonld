            "abstract": "Vietnam has achieved remarkable economic development over the last few decades, realizing major gains in productivity and output and contributing to national goals related to poverty reduction and economic transformation, including an increase in per capita income. While Vietnam has become a major international player in global food markets, there remains a segment of the rural population that has not benefited much from the country's success in terms of economic growth, particularly the success of the agricultural sector. The main objective of this analytical work is to recommend improvements to some of the agricultural interventions under the new National Target Programs (NTPs). There are significant gaps in agricultural incomes between the regions, and between the poor and non-poor within the region. This suggests that agriculture transformation is yet to be completed, and there are untapped opportunities to further increase agricultural incomes of the poor. This report thus focuses on closing this gap in agriculture, as another pathway for out of poverty. Although this work started when the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic was not fully pronounced in Vietnam and around the globe, the pandemic has had significant influence on the national economy as well as the performance of the agricultural sector. The implementation of the recommendations highlighted in this report could help strengthen the strategies for post-COVID-19 (Coronavirus) economic recovery",

            "title": "Comparative Literature : Interdisciplinary Considerations",
            "abstract": "Comparative Literature - Interdisciplinary Considerations is a wide-ranging exploration of various aspects of comparative literature and cultural phenomena from different angles. The authors delve into intriguing topics such as literary tourism, biofiction, colonial/postcolonial literature, suspense in literature, and the interaction between different artistic mediums. For instance, the analysis of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s works sheds light on the genres of magic realism and the Latin American boom, as well as how his literature influences literary tourism experiences. Another example is the study of Anna Enquist\u2019s work, which showcases the genre of biofiction and examines the complex messages conveyed through reconstructed voices and alternative perspectives, including the portrayal of Captain Cook\u2019s wife. This is compared with historical accounts of the 18th-century Ottoman Empire during Sultan Selim III\u2019s reign, as studied by Stanford Shaw in Between Old and New. The book also explores the theme of unease and suspense in Patricia Highsmith\u2019s writing, focusing on her iconic character Tom Ripley, known for his psychological depth and morally ambiguous nature. Additionally, discussions on colonial/postcolonial literature and the representation of women\u2019s restrictions from a historical perspective contribute to a better understanding of power dynamics, gender representation, and non-Western literature. Henri Fauconnier\u2019s Malaisie is analyzed in the context of \u201cparacoloniality,\u201d highlighting the transformative potential of Western texts and emphasizing overlooked aspects in discussions of colonial and postcolonial literature. The volume offers valuable insights into the representation of nations and historical figures through Malay and Persian travel narratives, as well as their influence on cultural identity. Moreover, the chapters explore the evolution of literary genres, the interconnectedness of literature with other art forms, and the impact of technological advancements on artistic expression. Overall, this book provides valuable perspectives on the rich tapestry of literature, art, and culture. It encourages scholars to explore diverse cultural expressions and fosters interdisciplinary dialogue within the field of comparative literature",

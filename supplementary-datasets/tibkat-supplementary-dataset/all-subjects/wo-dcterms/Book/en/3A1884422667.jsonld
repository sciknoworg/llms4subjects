            "abstract": "\"This is a concise book that introduces students to the basics of logical thinking and important mathematical structures that are critical for a solid understanding of logical formalisms themselves as well as for building the necessary background to tackle other fields that are based on these logical principles. Despite its compact and small size, it includes many solved problems and quite a few end-of-section exercises that will help readers consolidate their understanding of the material. This textbook is essential reading for anyone interested in the logical foundations of Informatics, Computer Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and other related areas. Written with undergraduate students in these disciplines in mind, this book can very well serve the needs of interested and curious readers who wish to get a grasp of the logical principles upon which these fields are built. This book does not require readers to possess math skills beyond those learned in high school\"--",

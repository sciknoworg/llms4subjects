                "\u201cToday, it is impossible to generate trust, reputation or stakeholder commitment without an authentic and coherent purpose. This book illustrates the strategic importance of creating purpose, and underlines how the future of business lies at the intersection of generating profit and creating societal value.\u201d \u2014Jaume Gir\u00f3, Chairman of Corporate Excellence \u2013 Centre for Reputation Leadership and CEO, \u201cla Caixa\u201d Banking Foundation \u201cPurpose-driven Organizations is the most comprehensive discussion of purpose available. If you are looking for the cutting edge of academic research, this is your go-to resource.\u201d \u2014Claudine Gartenberg, Assistant Professor at Wharton, University of Pennsylvania, USA \u201cThis book is the work of one of the pioneers in advocating a deep sense of mission in businesses: the result of over 20 years of consulting with companies across countries and industries, and academic study that has been tirelessly researched\u201d \u2014Alberto Ribera, Senior Lecturer and Director of Executive Coaching, IESE Business School, Spain A higher purpose is not simply about profit. Symbolising the motivations of our actions and efforts, it reflects something much more aspirational and contributes to our global society. This open access book offers novel solutions to ensure employees support a wider organizational meaning whilst guaranteeing that the company benefits from the employee\u2019s individual sense of purpose. Advocating a shift from previous models and theories, this book contributes to debate and offers insight for both scholars and practitioners. The chapters bring together academic rigour and practical models to help readers distinguish between the fads and influential strategies. Exploring the development of purpose at each level of business, from strategy and leadership to communication, this book avoids theoretical jargon and provides new approaches to building sustainable purpose-driven organizations.",

                "\"This collection of papers brings together expertise and up-to-date research results from an area outside the usual focal points of multilingualism research. Authored by leading experts of the languages at issue, it is a truly original and valuable contribution to the research of diverse aspects of language contact.\" --Johanna Laakso, Professor of Finno-Ugric Studies, University of Vienna This open access book sheds light on 21st-Century multilingualism in the Far North of Europe \u2013 Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Estonia \u2013 an area with multifaceted contacts between many Uralic and Indo-European languages. These contacts are taking new forms as migration and English as the lingua franca are changing the linguistic situation remarkably. The national languages dominate the life of most inhabitants, while the use of indigenous Saami languages, old minority languages, and the languages of new immigrants is limited to certain areas or domains. This volume takes a close look at multilingual individuals and discusses how their lives are affected by different languages. Maria Frick is a University Lecturer at the University of Oulu, Finland.

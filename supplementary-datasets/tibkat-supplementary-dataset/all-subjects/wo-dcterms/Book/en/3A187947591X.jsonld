            "abstract": "This book offers an extensive guide to the most engaging computer and laboratory sessions for teaching manufacturing engineering topics. It serves as a valuable resource for educators in planning their practical coursework. The book comprises 14 chapters covering a wide range of subjects, including design and simulations, various manufacturing processes such as additive manufacturing, injection molding, forming, machining, casting, and non-conventional machining, as well as process monitoring, metrology, and inspection using computed tomography. It also explores the application of methodologies like the design of experiments and machine learning. These contributions enable both lecturers and students to apply manufacturing engineering theory in real-world scenarios, drawing from the best practices developed in engineering institutions worldwide",

            "abstract": "This contributed volume gives a state-of-the-art overview of microplastics and nanoplastics (MPs and NPs) in soils and their relationship with growing plants. Through chapters contributed by a wide variety of researchers, the book offers readers an understanding of MP and NP adsorption, uptake, and effects, as well as implications for trophic transmission, food safety, and security. Cutting-edge topics such as trophic transfer and remediation of MPs and NPs in soil samples are also addressed.The book begins with a primer on terrestrial MPs and NPs, their effects on terrestrial plants, and how these contaminants affect human populations. From there, the volume is split into four sections which address both problems caused by MPs and NPs in soil and potential remediation solutions. The first section deals with the mechanics of how MPs and NPs pollute soils and how toxic chemicals affect the soil profile and its flora, fauna and microbes. The second section of the book discusses trophic transfer of MPs and NPs from roots to shoot, shoot to leaves, and then to fruits. The third section details the threats to humans that are present as a result of MPs and NPs in soils. The fourth and last section gives covers bioremediation techniques that can be employed in order to reclaim polluted soils",

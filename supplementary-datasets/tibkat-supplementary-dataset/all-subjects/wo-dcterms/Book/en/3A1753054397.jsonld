                "By merging public and private tangible and intangible capitals, Public Private Partnerships contracts (PPP) are fundamental to generate public value and to support economic and social development; in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic, they prove critical to pave the way for the recovery. This book is intended to support the co-evolution of the main public and private players involved in PPP contracts for infrastructure and service delivery, by providing principles, based on the academic and professional experience of the authors, that can be applied across sectors and jurisdictions. Drawing on the framework of public-private collaborations at macro, meso and micro level, this book provides a practical perspective on the most relevant legal, financial and contractual issues of PPP contracts for infrastructure and service delivery. Veronica Vecchi is Associate of Practice at SDA Bocconi School of Management, of Bocconi Univerity, Italy. She is author of numerous publications on Public Private Collaborations and serves as consultant for development banks and governments on PPP contracts. Francesca Casalini is Junior Lecturer at SDA Bocconi School of Management, Italy, and PhD Candidate and Research Assistant at the Institute of Systemic Governance and Public Management at the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland.

            "abstract": [
                "This book explores people\u2019s lived experience of discussing politics online. Based on original research involving in-depth conversations with 85 participants around the UK, it asks people about their own understanding of their online engagement, focusing on major UK political events and related debates \u2013the Scottish Independence Referendum, the EU Referendum and the UK Labour Party leadership contests. It shows how people\u2019s experiences are varied and influenced by many factors, but with a focus on personal feelings, needs and concerns as much as wider political ones. Participants struggle with self-awareness and understanding the motives and actions of others, which has an impact on their behaviour and perceived efficacy. They can have profound emotional responses owing to the constraints of using social media but still value it as a medium for political learning and self-expression. Communication effects in this environment are complex and unpredictable \u2013 there is much \u2018crosstalk\u2019. Social media itself is proving to be an unprecedented learning environment, where people begin to better understand their own behaviour and that of others and adapt over time. Elizabeth Anne Bailey completed her PhD at the University of Bedfordshire, UK. Before this, she worked for more than two decades in the UK Civil Service where she specialised in public communications strategy and management, managing major national communications campaigns. She currently works in local government and is a political campaigns ambassador for a large national charity.",

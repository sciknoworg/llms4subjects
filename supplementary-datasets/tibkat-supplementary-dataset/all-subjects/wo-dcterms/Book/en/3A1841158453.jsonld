Lack of good leadership and governance practices can lead to misuse of health system inputs such as human resources, health commodities and financial resources hence lowering the quality of services delivered.

Key Features: Improves the management of primary health facilities Helps the health facility managers and teams at primary healthcare level to effectively and efficiently lead and manage the facilities Enumerates practical scenarios on health issues that commonly occur in health facilities and provides alternative ways of addressing the issues raised in the scenarios",

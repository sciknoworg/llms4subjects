New technology, flexibilization and the intensification of work will have significant consequences for all those who will still have jobs in the future, and \u2013 much less studied so far \u2013 for the quality of their work. Good work is essential for general well-being: for the individual\u2019s quality of life, for the economy and for society. Good work for everyone should therefore be seen as an important aspiration for companies, institutions, social partners and governments. An essential read for an international audience of academics in the field of the sociology of work, labor economics and social policy, as well as for policymakers and researchers of trade unions, and representatives of other social movements",

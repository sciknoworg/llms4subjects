            "abstract": "The book is an extended commentary on Pushkin\u2019s poem \u201cThe Robber Brothers\u201d. The author redefines the poem\u2019s place in Pushkin\u2019s creative biography and provides a detailed line-by-line commentary. This poem by Alexander Pushkin has been considered peripheral among his \u201cSouthern Poems\u201d, and therefore researchers have paid little attention to it. The main cause of such lack of consideration was the specific history of the creation of \u201cThe Robber Brothers.\u201d Pushkin experimented with constructing a new poem at the intersection of different vectors of genre and style topical for both the poet and literature as a whole. Due to this dynamic tension, the concept of the poem became ambiguous \u2013 the choice of the plot composition and narrative methods were not determined. After making several attempts and sketches, Pushkin shortened his initial concept and created an author legend on the genesis of the poem, which was introduced to the first audience of readers as a disconnected fragment of a scattered whole, whereas the plot of the poem was depicted as based on a real event. Within Pushkin\u2019s corpus, \u201cThe Robber Brothers\u201d remained primarily a literary monument of the author\u2019s rapid evolution during his \u201cSouthern\u201d period. It proved to be an extremely concentrated experiment, ultimately without success",

            "abstract": "This book presents a theoretical analysis of several problems in thermal and solutal convections in magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) flows. It provides a systemic discussion on the development of fluid dynamics, continuum hypothesis, Newton\u2019s law of viscosity, heat transfer, mass transfer, thermal diffusion, diffusion-thermo-MHD, gray and non-gray gases, Fourier\u2019s law of conduction, and Fick\u2019s law of diffusion in such a way that readers with little knowledge in physics will find it easier to understand the contents. Some physical principles, such as those governing fluid motion, fluid temperature, and fluid concentration, are presented in vector form, allowing the corresponding form to be derived in any orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. Laplace transform technique in closed form is used to obtain exact solutions to unsteady one-dimensional flow problems, an implicit finite difference method of Crank\u2013Nicholson type is used to solve unsteady two-dimensional flow problems, and an asymptotic series expansion method is used to solve the governing equations of the steady three-dimensional flow problem analytically. Flow and transport phenomena are thoroughly treated in each chapter separately. This book emphasizes the influence of an induced magnetic field. The outcomes of the works are graphically depicted so that readers can gain a tangible understanding of the problems. It also includes a list of inverse Laplace transforms (ILTs) for several specific functions, some of which are not found in the existing literature. The ILTs of special functions are given in brief form and can further be utilized as standard formulae in finding those as special cases. Some new special functions are introduced in the book, along with appropriate definitions. As a result, the formulations for velocity, temperature, concentration, skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number have been appeared in brief and convenient forms that are uncommon in other literature. This book addresses numerous areas of contemporary magneto-fluid dynamics research that have major implications in engineering. It is primarily intended for researchers working in the field of heat and mass transfer in hydromagnetic flows.",

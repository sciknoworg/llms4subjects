The articles examine how material, \u2018oriental\u2019 objects and knowledge originating in non-Western communities helped building and strengthening the identity of Iberia\u2019s, southern France and northern Italian nobility and its lineages. It is shown how, in the perception of Christians, the public image of Jews and Moslems became constructed as that of adversaries, while their cultural knowledge, at the same time, would be integrated into Christian culture in a paradox manner, in which the \u2018self\u2019 necessarily depends on the \u2018other\u2019 and how visual tensions in art and space have been used as symbols of power",

            "abstract": "Today, there is a great deal of attention focused on sustainable growth worldwide. The increase in efficiency in the use of energy may even, in this historical moment, bring greater benefit than the use of renewable energies. Electricity appears to be the most sustainable of energies and the most promising hope for a planet capable of growing without compromising its own health and that of its inhabitants. Power electronics and electrical drives are the key technologies that will allow energy savings through the reduction of energy losses in many applications. This Special Issue has collected several scientific contributions related to energy efficiency in electrical equipment. Some articles are dedicated to the use and optimization of permanent magnet motors, which allow obtaining the highest level of efficiency. Most of the contributions describe the energy improvements that can be achieved with power electronics and the use of suitable control techniques. Last but not least, some articles describe interesting solutions for hybrid vehicles, which were created mainly to save energy in the smartest way possible",

                "This book comprises the select proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Industrial Tribology (ICIT), IndiaTrib-2022, jointly organized by the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India, and the Tribology Society of India. It covers recent developments in the broad field of tribology. Apart from the traditional fields in tribology, this book also covers many new emerging fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in tribology, bio-tribology, 3D printing, etc. This book is highly useful for researchers and professionals in the field of tribology, mechanical engineering, production engineering, aerospace engineering, nuclear engineering, and engineering materials.",

            "abstract": "Publisher\u2019s description: This book presents a systematic analysis of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, the linearized Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, and their applications, with emphasis on both interior and boundary theories. Starting from scratch, it gives an extensive survey of fundamental results, essential techniques, and intriguing phenomena in the solvability, geometry, and regularity of Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations. It describes in depth diverse applications arising in geometry, fluid mechanics, meteorology, economics, and the calculus of variations. The modern treatment of boundary behaviors of solutions to Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations, a very important topic of the theory, is thoroughly discussed. The book synthesizes many important recent advances, including Savin\u2019s boundary localization theorem, spectral theory, and interior and boundary regularity in Sobolev and H\u00f6lder spaces with optimal assumptions. It highlights geometric aspects of the theory and connections with adjacent research areas. This self-contained book provides the necessary background and techniques in convex geometry, real analysis, and partial differential equations, presents detailed proofs of all theorems, explains subtle constructions, and includes well over a hundred exercises. It can serve as an accessible text for graduate students as well as researchers interested in this subject.",

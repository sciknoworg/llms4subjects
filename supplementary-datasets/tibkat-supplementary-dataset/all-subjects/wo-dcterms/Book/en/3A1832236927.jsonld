            "abstract": "Blending literary analysis and memoir, Something More Splendid Than Two is at once an excavation of intergenerational wounds, a dance number, a poem, and a fraught love letter from son to father that disrupts the dominant narratives surrounding the life and myth of Joaqu\u00edn Murrieta. In the Mexican American imaginary, the legend of Joaqu\u00edn Murrieta has been recast to explain the wounding of Mexican American men after the 1848 border formation. In these versions, Joaqu\u00edn is a vigilante hero and the patriarchal father of the Chicanx movement.  Revisiting the most circulated version of the Joaqu\u00edn myth, The Life and Adventures of Joaqu\u00edn Murieta written by Cherokee writer John Rollin Ridge, the first published Native American author in the US, Something More Splendid Than Two offers an alternative to these versions. Stitching together multiple tangled histories of Indigenous and Mexican woundings living in the margins of Ridge's 19th-century novel, alfaro opens a queer timeline where Chicanx and Indigenous solidarities can be imagined. By attuning to the choreographies of power and patriarchy that produced readers and writers like Ridge and the author of this book, jos\u00e9 rivers alfaro imagines that in that endless encounter between reader and writer, both time travel and collective healing are possible",

            "abstract": "Gorgias of Leontinoi in Sicily is widely considered to be the most prominent and important of the sophists. He traveled to Athens in 427 BCE\u2014about the time Plato was born\u2014where he earned both the ire of philosophers and the obols of young men keen on learning the powerful art of logos. As the dialogue named for him shows, Gorgias is representative for Plato of rhetoric and sophistry and all the ways in which they stray from, or even threaten, the philosophical attainment of truth, thereby imperiling the well-being of the polis. Although some of Gorgias\u2019s work survives\u2014and is included here in new translations\u2014none of it is as widely studied as Plato\u2019s Gorgias. For this and other reasons, there has been a scholarly tendency to treat rhetoric and Gorgias himself as opposed, or even antithetical to, philosophy. As the articles in this volume make clear, however, there is much that is philosophical in Gorgias\u2019s work, just as there is much that is rhetorical in the method of Plato\u2019s Socrates. In fact, there is great nuance to Plato\u2019s treatment of Gorgias\u2019s rhetorical abilities, and Gorgias himself can be understood as a subtle and sophisticated (in the positive sense) philosopher. In short, the papers collected here show that the relationship between Plato and Gorgias\u2014and, more generally, between philosophy and rhetoric\u2014is much more complicated, and potentially more mutually beneficial, than is traditionally recognized.Edited by S. Montgomery Ewegen and Coleen P. Zoller, the volume contains new translations of Gorgias\u2019s Helen, Palamedes, and On Not Being, introduced by Jurgen R. Gatt. In addition to Ewegen and Zoller, essays have been contributed by Livio Rossetti, Fran\u00e7ois Renaud, R.J. Barnes, Mauro Serra, Stamatia Dova, Erminia Di Iulio, Enrico Piergiacomi, Edward Schiappa, Yosef Z. Liebersohn, Robert Metcalf, and Sonja Tanner",

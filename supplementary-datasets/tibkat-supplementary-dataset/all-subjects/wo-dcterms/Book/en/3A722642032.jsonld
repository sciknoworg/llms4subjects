                "Semiconductors continue to get smaller while at the same time the density of devices that conduct electrons have increased tremendously. Because of this density of functions and devices, engineers and scientists search for practical and effective new materials that are non-conductive (dielectric) in order to build much smaller and viable gates.  Chip density and performance improvements are driven by aggressive scaling of semiconductor devices. In both logic and memory applications, SiO2 gate dielectrics have reached their minimum thickness due to direct tunneling current and reliability conce",

                "In this work, the reliability of HfO2 (hafnium oxide) with poly gate and dual metal gate electrode (Ru-Ta alloy, Ru) was investigated. Hard breakdown and soft breakdown, particularly the Weibull slopes, were studied under constant voltage stress. Dynamic stressing has also been used. It was found that the combination of trapping and detrapping contributed to the enhancement of the projected lifetime.  The results fromthe polarity dependence studies showed that the substrate injection exhibited a shorter projected lifetime and worse soft breakdown behavior, compared to the gate injection. The origin of soft breakdown (first breakdown) was studied and the results suggested that the soft breakdownmay be due to one layer breakdown in the bilayer structure (HfO2/SiO2: 4 nm/4 nm). Low Weibull slope was in part attributed to the lower barrier height of HfO2 at the interface layer. Interface layer optimization was conducted in terms of mobility, swing, and short channel effect using deep submicron MOSFET devices"

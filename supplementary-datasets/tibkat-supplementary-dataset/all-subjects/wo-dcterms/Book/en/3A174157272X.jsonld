                "This book discusses the geopolitics of development from the point of view of the Global South. Written by scholars and development experts from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, this volume presents reflections on various historical, current, and future trajectories of development in the contemporary Global South. The book is divided into five parts. Part I focuses on the relationship of development in the Global South to globalization, discussing the diversity of situations across countries in structural terms. Part II critiques and analyzes the concept and paradigms of development, emphasizing alternative discourses and policy models. Part III focuses on the analysis of the relationship between environment and development, showing how environmental conditions have become a key factor in the renewal of development thinking. Part IV examines different cultural strategies and conceptions constituting the basis of development thinking and policy in different fields. Part V addresses the construction of knowledge pertaining to the Global South, revisiting the theoretical trajectory of development models and advocating for the construction of new ideas around the region. Providing a multidimensional look at development in the Global South, this volume will benefit academics, development experts, and postgraduate students interested in having a global vision of the ideas of development in different territorial and cultural fields."

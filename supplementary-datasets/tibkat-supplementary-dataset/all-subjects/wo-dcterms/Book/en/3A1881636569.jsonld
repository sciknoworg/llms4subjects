            "abstract": "The goal of this book is to provide a broad understanding on the New Perspectives in Software Engineering research. The advancement of computers, and mobile devices, among others, has led to the creation of new areas of knowledge to improve the operation and application of software in any sector, allowing many previously unimaginable activities. In this context, the evolution of software and its applications has created new domains of interest, emerging New Perspectives of Software Engineering for these new areas of knowledge such as: DevOps, Industry 4.0, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Gamification, Cybersecurity, Telecommunications, Health Technologies, Energy Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Robot control, among others. This book is used in different domains in which a broad scope of audience is interested: software engineers, analyst, project management, consultant, academics and researchers in the field both in universities and business schools, information technology directors and managers, and quality managers and directors. Finally, the book contents are also useful for Ph.D. students, master's, and undergraduate students of IT-related degrees such as Computer Science and Information Systems",

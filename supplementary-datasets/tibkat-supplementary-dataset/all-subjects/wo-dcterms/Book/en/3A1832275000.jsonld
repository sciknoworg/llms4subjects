            "abstract": "The publication, more than ten years ago, of a rural settlement occupied from the 6th century BC to the 3rd century AD. the farm of The Boisanne in Plou\u00ebr-sur-Rance, in the C\u00f4tes d'Armor Department (Daf 58), permitted Yves Menez to address the notion of indigenous farms. Today, Ivan Jahier revises this question based on the Protohistoric site of Courseulles-sur-Mer, in this case located inland from the Normandy coast. This site possesses all the classic elements of an indigenous farm: houses, fences, outbuildings, storage facilities, an agricultural and pasture area, domestic remains, traces of craft activities, and even a few graves, but distributed inside and around an enclosure wall three to four times larger than most such walls of the Iron Age of this region What was the purpose of this grouping of a number of storage facilities within an enclosure wall whose function was clearly more ostentatious than defensive and which included no more than two or three houses? Ivan Jahier attempts to answer this question through a solid analytical approach. The conclusions he draws and interpretations he proposes shed new light on the organization of society during the 5th century BC and enable the formulation of new hypotheses concerning the origins of the cultural transition of the beginning of the second Iron Age in Normandy",

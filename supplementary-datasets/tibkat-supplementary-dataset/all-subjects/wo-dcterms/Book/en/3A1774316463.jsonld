            "abstract": "In Spring 2020, Western Balkan countries - like most others in the world-have been forced to impose tight restrictions on economic life to contain the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. In the first half of 2020, the world has seen explosive growth of infections with the deadly novel virus. As country after country has been forced to shut down large areas of social and economic life to slow contagion, the Western Balkans have not been spared. The first cases were recognized as early as the first week of March. As of April 27, 2020, the Johns Hopkins corona virus data center now reports that over 11,000 cases have been confirmed in the six countries in the region. In response, all six have enforced lockdowns and strict social distancing measures. International airports in all countries were closed for passenger traffic. The initial lockdowns have been extended. The capitals of Kosovo and Albania are under quarantine, as are other cities in the region. Key economic sectors, such as restaurants and nonessential retail, have been shut down. Travel and social gatherings have been restricted or banned, and schools and universities have been closed. The RER No. 17 is a collection of notes on the Economic and Social Impact of COVID-19. This includes three Notes: \"Setting the stage: Reviewing the state and vulnerabilities of the Western Balkan Economies as they face COVID-19\"; \"Outlook: Hard Times Require Good Economics\"; and the Western Balkan Country Notes",

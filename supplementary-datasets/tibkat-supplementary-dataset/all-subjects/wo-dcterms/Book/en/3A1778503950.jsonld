            "abstract": "Since its emergence, big data has brought us new forms of energy, technology and means of organization which will generate greater values by crossover, integration, openness and sharing of data. Nevertheless, risks caused by open access and the flow of data also bring us enormous challenges to privacy, business secrets and social and national securities. This raises people\u2019s awareness on data sharing, privacy protection and social justice, and becomes a significant governance problem in the world. In order to solve these problems, Data Rights Law 1.0 is innovative in that it proposes a new concept of the \u00abdata person\u00bb. It defines \u00abdata rights\u00bb as the rights derived from the \u00abdata person\u00bb and \u00abdata rights system\u00bb as the order based on \u00abdata rights\u00bb. \u00abData rights law\u00bb is the legal normative formed out of the \u00abdata rights system\u00bb. In this way, the book constructs a legal framework of \u00abdata rights-data rights system-data rights law\u00bb. If data is considered as basic rights, on which new order and laws are to be built, it will bring brand new and profound meaning to future human life",

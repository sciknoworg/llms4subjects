            "abstract": "Wireless Information Networks: Architecture, Resource Management, and Mobile Data provides new insights into many of the issues that need resolution for the successful introduction of new wireless communication services by the end of the decade. Views are represented from industry and universities from a number of nations, presenting a global perspective. The book contains four main sections: Architecture, Radio Resource Management, Access, Mobile Data/Mobile Networks. The section on Architecture discusses fundamental issues concerned with wireless services that are provided to mobile users and which must use the fixed network, including the manner in which broadband services (with diverse requirements) will be accommodated by the wireless link, and how they will be integrated with ATM. The Radio Resource Management section is concerned with channel assignment, power control, handoff and admission control. Further understanding of each of these issues is needed. Furthermore, their optimum combination is not well understood at all: valuable insights into these issues are provided. The Access section provides new studies on evaluating and improving access methods. Everyone is aware of the importance of access from the recent and ongoing debate between TDMA and CDMA. Mobility provides entirely new challenges for technologists, which are explored in the section on Mobile Data/Mobile Networks. Information storage and access for mobile users need new solutions from database and processing viewpoints. Providing data services with stringent performance requirements over hostile radio environments, and to and from mobile users, presents formidable challenges. The book is an excellent reference for all those interested in the subject, and may be used as the text for advanced courses on the topic",

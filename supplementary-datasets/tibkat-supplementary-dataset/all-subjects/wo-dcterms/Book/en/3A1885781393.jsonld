The current book presents research investigations into learners\u2019 motivation in learning German as a foreign language. A qualitative research design conducted as a multi-case study was chosen in order to gain a deeper insight into the issue of motivation. The results obtained showed the wide scope of teachers\u2019 motivating influence on their learners. Many of the existing findings on motivation could be verified. Moreover, the specifics of motivation towards German as a second foreign language as well as the culturally conditioned specifics concerning Czech learners\u2019 attitudes towards the German language have been highlighted",

            "abstract": "Biomarkers are of critical medical importance for oncologists, allowing them to predict and detect disease and to determine the best course of action for cancer patient care. Prognostic markers are used to evaluate a patient\u2019s outcome and cancer recurrence probability after initial interventions such as surgery or drug treatments and, hence, to select follow-up and further treatment strategies. On the other hand, predictive markers are increasingly being used to evaluate the probability of benefit from clinical intervention(s), driving personalized medicine. Evolving technologies and the increasing availability of \u201cmultiomics\u201d data are leading to the selection of numerous potential biomarkers, based on DNA, RNA, miRNA, protein, and metabolic alterations within cancer cells or tumor microenvironment, that may be combined with clinical and pathological data to greatly improve the prediction of both cancer progression and therapeutic treatment responses. However, in recent years, few biomarkers have progressed from discovery to become validated tools to be used in clinical practice. This Special Issue comprises eight review articles and five original studies on novel potential prognostic and predictive markers for different cancer types",

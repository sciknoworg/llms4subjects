            "abstract": "\"This book titled \"Microfiltration: Principle, Process and Applications\" is formed of 6 chapters covering many research aspects on microfiltration. These aspects include reviews and original research dealing mainly with fouling and cleaning of microfiltration membranes. In Chapter 1, mechanisms of fouling and factors affecting the fouling are presented. Also, it deals with techniques that assist mitigation of membrane fouling that occurs in microfiltration. The aim of Chapter 2 was the modelling and optimization by artificial neural network and genetic algorithm of yeast suspensions turbulence promoter assisted cross-flow microfiltration in concentration operation mode. Chapter 3 focuses on the principles, developments, implementation and application of microfiltration in wastewater treatment. In addition, the integration of microfiltration with other water and wastewater treatment technique is also included as well as the advantages and disadvantage of the microfiltration. The Chapter 4 objective is to introduce the most commonly used turbulence promoters' types. Furthermore, congenial studies on the turbulence promoters' application in the cross-flow MF regarding food industry streams and products are also presented within the chapter. In Chapter 5, the microfiltration process was used in order to obtain concentrated papaya (Carica papaya L.) pulp, evaluating the flux permeate from papaya treated pulp with enzyme pectinase and using different nominal mass molecular weights and different membranes materials. Chapter 6 discusses the performances and the quality of treated water of a Tunisian textile industry through a low-cost tubular ceramic membrane prepared by extrusion of a plastic paste prepared from clay powder mixed with organic additives and water\"--",

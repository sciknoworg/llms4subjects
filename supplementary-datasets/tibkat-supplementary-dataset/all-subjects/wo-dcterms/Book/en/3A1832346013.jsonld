            "abstract": "New information and knowledge are important aspects of innovation in modern farming systems. There is currently an abundance of digital and data-driven solutions that can potentially transform our food systems. At a time when the general public has concerns about how food is produced and the impact of farm production systems on the environment, strategies to increase public acceptance and the sustainability of food production are required more than ever. New tools and technology can provide timely insights into aspects such as nutrient profiles, the tracking of animal or plant wellbeing, and land-use options to enhance inputs and outputs associated with the farm business. Such solutions have the ultimate aim of enhancing production efficiency and contributing to the process of learning about the advantages of the innovation, while ensuring more sustainable food supplies. At the farm level, any new information needs to be in a useful format and beneficial for management and farm decision-making. The papers in this Special Issue evaluate agri-business innovation that can enhance farm-level decision-making",

            "abstract": "Reframing Luchino Visconti: Film and Art gives new and unique insights into the roots of the visual vocabulary of one of Italy\u2019s most reputed film authors. It meticulously researches Visconti\u2019s appropriation of European art in his set and costume design, from pictorial citations and the archaeology of the set to the use of portraits and pictorial references in costume design. Yet it also investigates Visconti\u2019s cinematography in combination with his mise-en-sc\u00e8ne in terms of staging, framing, mobile framing, and mirroring. Here not only aesthetic conventions from art but also those from silent and sound cinema have been clearly appropriated by Visconti and his crew.  This book gives answers to the question: where does the visual splendour of Visconti\u2019s films come from?  \u201cThis book, apart from showing a long-standing passion and fidelity, gives us one of the most original international researches ever produced on Visconti\u2019s work. Through thorough archival research and numerous interviews with people close to Visconti such as his crew members, Ivo Blom\u2019s monograph reveals the extraordinary network of iconographic and cultural connections that unite Visconti\u2019s work, expose Visconti\u2019s cinematographic signature and link different historic events with crucial moments in Visconti\u2019s personal life.\u201d \u2013 Gian Piero Brunetta (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova)  \u201cThis journey through Visconti\u2019s films broadens our view of an oeuvre whose richness is not as much due to its manifold cultural references, but more to their daring use by the artist.\u201d \u2013 Mich\u00e8le Lagny (Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Nouvelle \u2013 Paris 3)",

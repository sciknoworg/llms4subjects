            "abstract": "\"This text presents a comprehensive treatment of signal processing and linear systems suitable for undergraduate students in electrical engineering, It is based on Lathi's widely used book, Linear Systems and Signals, with additional applications to communications, controls, and filtering as well as new chapters on analog and digital filters and digital signal processing.This volume's organization is different from the earlier book. Here, the Laplace transform follows Fourier, rather than the reverse; continuous-time and discrete-time systems are treated sequentially, rather than interwoven. Additionally, the text contains enough material in discrete-time systems to be used not only for a traditional course in signals and systems but also for an introductory course in digital signal processing. In Signal Processing and Linear Systems Lathi emphasizes the physical appreciation of concepts rather than the mere mathematical manipulation of symbols. Avoiding the tendency to treat engineering as a branch of applied mathematics, he uses mathematics not so much to prove an axiomatic theory as to enhance physical and intuitive understanding of concepts. Wherever possible, theoretical results are supported by carefully chosen examples and analogies, allowing students to intuitively discover meaning for themselves\"--",

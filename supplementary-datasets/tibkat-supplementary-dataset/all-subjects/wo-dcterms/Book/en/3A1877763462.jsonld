            "abstract": "Exploring the contentious landscape of Nigeria\u2019s escalating violence, this book describes the changing roles of traditional authorities in combatting contemporary security challenges.  Set against a backdrop of widespread security threats \u2013 including insurgency, land disputes, communal violence, regional independence movements, and widespread criminal activities \u2013 perhaps more than ever before, Nigeria\u2019s conventional security infrastructure seems ill-equipped for the job. This book offers a fresh, empirical analysis of the roles of traditional authorities \u2013 including kings, Ezes, Obas, and Emirs \u2013 who are often hailed as potent alternatives to the state in security governance. It complicates the assumption that these traditional leaders, by virtue of their customary legitimacy and popular roots, are singularly effective in preventing and managing violence. Instead, in exploring their creative adaptation to governance roles after a dramatic postcolonial downturn, this book argues that traditional leaders can augment, but not substitute, the state in addressing insecurity.  This book\u2019s in-depth analysis will be of interest to researchers and policy makers across African and security studies, political science, anthropology, and development.   David Ehrhardt is an Associate Professor of International Development at Leiden University, The Netherlands. His main research interests are African governance and educational innovation. David has published extensively on Nigeria and co-leads the Learning Mindset project that promotes autonomous learning in higher education.  David Oladimeji Alao is a Professor in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration, and Chief of Staff to the President/Vice Chancellor, Babcock University, Ogun State, Nigeria. Professor Alao has authored several articles and 3 edited books.   M. Sani Umar is a Professor in the Department of History and Diplomatic Studies, University of Abuja, Nigeria. His research centres on religious vio- lence and peace building, with a focus on understanding the roots of religious conflict and the dynamics of religious pluralism",

            "abstract": "\"The Wiley SID book series organizers and our editorial team believe that there is a strong need in the display field for a comprehensive book describing the manufacturing of the display panels used in today's display products. The objective of this book, entitled Flat Panel Display Manufacturing, is to give a broad overview for the key manufacturing topics, serving as a reference text. The book will cover all aspects of the manufacturing processes of TFT LCD and AMOLED, which includes the fabrication processes of the TFT backplane, cell process, module packaging, and test processes. Additionally, the book introduces important topics in manufacturing science and engineering related to quality control, factory and supporting systems architectures, and green manufacturing. The book can serve as a reference book not only for display engineers in the field, but also for students in display fields. One might think that flat panel display manufacturing is a mature subject, but the state of the art manufacturing technologies enabling today's high end TFT LCDs and OLED displays are still evolving for the next generation displays. The editorial team invited authors from major display manufacturers and experts in each manufacturing topic (equipment, processing, etc.). Last but not least, we are also grateful to the Wiley SID book series team, and especially to Dr. Ian Sage for help planning, reviewing the early drafts, and bringing this book to light.\"--f numff",

            "abstract": "\"Designing offshore wave energy converters (WEC) devices requires a thorough understanding of many aspects of science and engineering, namely wave hydrodynamics, wave-WEC interactions, mechanical design aspects, analysis tools, and good experience in conducting experiments. This book provides the tools for understanding these complex systems and addresses the basic concepts of WECs through to detailed analysis and design. A few devices developed and experimentally investigated are discussed in detail, some of which are considered highly novel and still in the preliminary stages of study in the existing literature. Features: Offers numerous detailed design methods and practical model studies Presents analysis of the dynamic response behavior of WECs, based upon experimental studies on scale models Covers the most recent and novel innovations in the field Includes discussion of offshore wind farms as another green energy alternative, and examines their conceptual development and design This book serves as a useful guide for both academicians and offshore practicing professionals in naval architecture and offshore engineering, as well as civil and structural engineering. In addition, it also helps in understanding structural behavior in terms of its risk criteria, efficiency, service life, and reliability. Readers will gain comprehensive knowledge about the design and development of offshore wave energy devices and the preliminary design of offshore wind turbines, which are currently largely absent in the scientific literature\"--",

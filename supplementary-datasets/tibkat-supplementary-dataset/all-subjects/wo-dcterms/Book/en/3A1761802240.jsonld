                "Each year we witness several paradigm shifts in mobility systems and services, increasingly so as technology progresses. The future of mobility is people-centric, software-defined, connected, and electric. Now more than ever, it is imperative for current and aspiring leaders in the field to understand the foundations of people-centric smart cities with a focus on sustainability. Smart Mobility offers a holistic view of the current and emerging smart mobility systems and explores their foundational technologies, technology enablers, and disruptors. Author Alaa Khamis acknowledges the need for smart mobility arising with growing world urbanization, and the impact of this on public health, congestion, and climate change. Khamis expertly interrogates how a focus on smart mobility can mitigate all of these risks using his triad of complementary factors: technology, governance, and city planning. In this book you\u2019ll study how foundational technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things, robotics, and many more all work together to allow for smart mobility in our modern era. Khamis additionally covers the topical events of the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzes its impact on consumer behavior and the expected short-term disruptions and longer-term structural changes. The socioeconomic changes in our urban centers are vast, and Smart Mobility breaks down the core concepts with meaningful data and insights. You will: Explore different mobility modes, including mobility-as-a-service, shared mobility, mobility on demand, the gig economy and the passenger economy Cover how the smart mobility triad - technology, governance, and city planning - work together to create a smart and sustainable mobility See how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting consumer behavior and preferences and changing the future of mobility."

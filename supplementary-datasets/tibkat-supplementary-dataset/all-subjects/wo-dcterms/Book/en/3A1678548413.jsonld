                "This book synthesizes the results of author\u2019s researches and results from known publications in the field of surface layers fracture of cyclical contacting bodies (machine parts). The calculation models and calculating procedures of stress-strain states of cyclically contacting solids with cracks, have been proposed. On this basis, the cracks paths propagation which form nearsurface damages have been constracted, taking into consideration the tribojoint operating parameters and crack growth resistance characteristics of materials by transverse shear and normal opening. The computer methodology to study fracture processes in tribojoint elements contact area and estimation of their residual lifetime by the criteria of typical contact fatigue damages formation (spalling, pitting, cracking, \"dark spots\", cavities etc.) has been developed. Recommendations for optimizing operating parameters of joints (contact stresses magnitude, friction/lubrication conditions, materials crack resistance etc) for elements of rolling pairs (wheel\u2013rail systems, backup roll \u2013 working roll of rolling mills etc.) and some fretting pairs are formulated"

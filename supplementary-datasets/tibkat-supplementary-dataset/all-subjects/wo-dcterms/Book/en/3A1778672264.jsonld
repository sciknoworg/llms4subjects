            "abstract": "The research project Beatrijs Internationaal brought together about a hundred literary translators and researchers in the field of historical and modern Dutch literature, translation studies and related disciplines, from twenty different language areas. The participants immersed themselves in questions about the international circulation and reception of the famous Middle Dutch legend of Our Lady, from its origins to our own time. Almost a hundred adaptations and translations of the Beatrijs-story were found, and new discoveries are still being made. The case of Beatrijs brought about new theoretical discussions, cooperation and exchange in the field of Dutch Studies, as is demonstrated by this volume. By means of diverse approaches the authors show how a literary text from the relatively small geographical area of the Dutch language can circulate both inside and outside its linguistic borders in different periods. With their wide spectrum of research questions, methodological approaches and selections of material, the contributions are a reflection of the richness of international Dutch Studies in the 21st century. Inspired by translation, adaptation and reception studies, this volume helps us to answer the question which characteristics of a particular text make it a likely candidate for crossing linguistic, geophysical, historical, and other borders. This volume is a contribution to the historiography of the export and dissemination of Dutch literature",

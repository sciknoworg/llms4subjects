            "abstract": "E. M. Forster first encountered Billy Budd in 1926. Some twenty years later, he embarked on a collaboration with Benjamin Britten and Eric Crozier, adapting Melville\u2019s novella for the opera stage. The libretto they produced poignantly reaffirms the Forsterian creed of salvation through personal relationships. This study presents an extensive exploration of Forster\u2019s involvement in the interpretation, transformation and re-creation of Melville\u2019s text. It situates the story of the Handsome Sailor in the wider context of Forster\u2019s literary oeuvre, his life, and his life writings. In detailed readings, Billy Budd becomes a lens through which the themes, patterns and leitmotifs of Forsterian thought and creative imagination are brought into focus. A close re-examination of the libretto sketches serves to shed new light on the collaborative process in which Melville\u2019s story was changed to fit an archetypal array of plot and character types that is central to Forster\u2019s own storytelling",

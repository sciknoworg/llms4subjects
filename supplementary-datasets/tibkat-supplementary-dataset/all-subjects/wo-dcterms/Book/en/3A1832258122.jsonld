The number of patients with gynecological cancer has been increasing worldwide due to its high lethality and lack of early detection tools and effective therapeutic interventions. In this regard, basic research on its pathophysiology and novel molecular targeting intervention is required to improve the prognosis of gynecologic cancer. This book contains 13 papers, including 8 original research papers and 5 reviews focusing on the basic research of gynecologic oncology. The reader can learn about state-of-the-art research and obtain extensive knowledge of the current advances in the field of gynecologic oncology. It is my hope that this book contributes towards the progress of gynecologic oncology",

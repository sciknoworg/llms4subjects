            "abstract": "Burdened by poverty, illiteracy, and vulnerability as Mexican immigrants to California\u2019s Coachella Valley, three generations of Gonz\u00e1lez men turn to vices or withdraw into depression. As brothers Rigoberto and Alex grow to manhood, they are haunted by the traumas of their mother\u2019s early death, their lonely youth, their father\u2019s desertion, and their grandfather\u2019s invective. Rigoberto\u2019s success in escaping\u2014first to college and then by becoming a writer\u2014is blighted by his struggles with alcohol and abusive relationships, while Alex contends with difficult family relations, his own rocky marriage, and fatherhood. Descending into a dark emotional space that compromises their mental and physical health, the brothers eventually find hope in aiding each other. This is an honest and revealing window into the complexities of Latino masculinity, the private lives of men, and the ways they build strength under the weight of grief, loss, and despair",

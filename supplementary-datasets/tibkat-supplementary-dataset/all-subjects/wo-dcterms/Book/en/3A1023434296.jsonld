                "'This groundbreaking exploration of the concept of necessity entrepreneurship cuts to the heart of the culture wars with potential ramifications for public policy. Central to this volume is the question, \"What is culture?\" The politically incorrect conclusion that some cultures are \"progress\"-prone, while others may be \"progress\"-resistant, should anoint new generations of educators to rise to this challenge. The dilemma is, how do we maintain respect for cultural diversity while at the same time, encouraging subsistent families and communities to become more self-sufficient? The answer to this question will determine, in large part, the direction of our welfare policies in the government as well as our philanthropy in the private sector.' --Hilaire Kallendorf, Texas A&M University, US. Necessity entrepreneurs are individuals in developing countries who start small enterprises out of necessity. While they range from street sellers to educated hopefuls with little access to formal employment, the one thing that unites them is the need to survive. This volume is the first-known compilation of theories contributed by international scholars who have worked together to establish a theory-based discourse on necessity entrepreneurship, microenterprise education and long-term economic development. An estimated one billion individuals in both developed and developing nations can be defined as necessity entrepreneurs; individuals who have no other viable option for licit income than to start a small, income-generating activity. However, unless these 'necessity entrepreneurs' have access to meaningful education, they will never realize the powerful, economic potential to impact the economic development of their respective nations. This volume is the foundation upon which the budding discipline of necessity entrepreneurship can be built. This book is an essential resource for policy makers, educators and academics interested in global economic development and sustainable business. Moreover, it will be an invaluable tool to those working in non-profit organizations and non-governmental organizations",

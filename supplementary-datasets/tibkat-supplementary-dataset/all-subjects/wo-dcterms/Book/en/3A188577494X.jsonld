Non-communicable diseases have emerged as an important public health problem in all segments of society and thus health promotion and disease prevention activities are crucial. Clinical and epidemiology studies have provided sufficient evidence about the health benefits of a nutritious diet and regular physical activity. This book includes seven chapters organized into two sections on \u201cBasics of Health Promotion\u201d and \u201cApproaches to Health Promotion\u201d. Chapters address such topics as the benefits of physical activity, projects in health promotion, technological tools in health promotion, social media in health promotion and health policy, and much more",

            "abstract": "\"This book describes the characteristics of the five different disciplines of systems which are Systems Theory, Systems Science, Thinking in Systems, Systems Architecting, and Systems Engineering. The book discusses how they all relate to each other and form a synergistic set of disciplines. Systems Theory and Applications: A Multi-Disciplinary Approach presents how the five different disciplines of systems are all related to each other. The book offers a concise view of the systems perspective and discusses how it applies to many system types such as physical, abstract, and human. Highlights are on how systems disciplines address problems and abandon the fragmented approach of implementing the disciplines separately. The book forms an enlightenment on understanding the relationship between systems engineering and system theory and explains that systems are everywhere, and that universe is made up of systems. Students, designers, and those interested in systems theory will find this book of interest\"--",

            "abstract": "In 1990, Gerald Conaty was hired as senior curator of ethnology at the Glenbow Museum, with the particular mandate of improving the museum\u2019s relationship with Aboriginal communities. That same year, the Glenbow had taken its first tentative steps toward repatriation by returning sacred objects to First Nations\u2019 peoples. These efforts drew harsh criticism from members of the provincial government. Was it not the museum\u2019s primary legal, ethical, and fiduciary responsibility to ensure the physical preservation of its collections? Would the return of a sacred bundle to ceremonial use not alter and diminish its historical worth and its value to the larger society? Undaunted by such criticism, Conaty oversaw the return of more than fifty medicine bundles to Blackfoot and Cree communities between the years of 1990 and 2000, at which time the First Nations Sacred Ceremonial Objects Repatriation Act (FNSCORA)\u2014still the only repatriation legislation in Canada\u2014was passed. \u201cRepatriation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis a vital component in the creation of an equitable, diverse, and respectful society.\u201d We Are Coming Home is the story of the highly complex process of repatriation as described by those intimately involved in the work, notably the Piikani, Siksika, and Kainai elders who provided essential oversight and guidance. We also hear from the Glenbow Museum\u2019s president and CEO at the time and from an archaeologist then employed at the Provincial Museum of Alberta who provides an insider\u2019s view of the drafting of FNSCORA. These accounts are framed by Conaty\u2019s reflections on the impact of museums on First Nations, on the history and culture of the Niitsitapi, or Blackfoot, and on the path forward. With Conaty\u2019s passing in August of 2013, this book is also a tribute to his enduring relationships with the Blackfoot, to his rich and exemplary career, and to his commitment to innovation and mindful museum practice. <br> \u201c\u2026deeply informative and readable\u2026. An absence of Canadian texts in the museum field and in cultural communication leaves open the mistaken idea that we are mere ciphers for practices from abroad. By making an important Alberta story available in this fascinating and important volume, AU Press has performed an essential cultural service for all Canadians.\u201d \u2014Literary Review of Canada",

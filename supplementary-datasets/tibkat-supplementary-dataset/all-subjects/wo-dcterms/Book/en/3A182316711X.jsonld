                "Know how to design and use identity management to protect your application and the data it manages. At a time when security breaches result in increasingly onerous penalties, it is paramount that application developers and owners understand identity management and the value it provides when building applications. This book takes you from account provisioning to authentication to authorization, and covers troubleshooting and common problems to avoid. The authors include predictions about why this will be even more important in the future. Application best practices with coding samples are provided. Solving Identity and Access Management in Modern Applications gives you what you need to design identity and access management for your applications and to describe it to stakeholders with confidence. You will be able to explain account creation, session and access management, account termination, and more. This expanded edition has been revised to provide an overview of the new version of OAuth (2.1)\u2015the primary changes in this version, including features that were removed from 2.1 that were in 2.0 and why they were removed. The discussion of the book's accompanying sample application has been revised to cover in more depth the approach for developing the application (also revised). A new section has been added on the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) specification, which is useful for devices with limited UI capability. Minor additions include the topics of identity proofing, the need to capture and organize consent information, the impact of tracking prevention technology on certain identity protocols, and the availability of additional options for authorization requests such as OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests and JWT-Secured Authorization Requests (RFC 9101). What You\u2019ll Learn \u2022 Understand key identity management concepts \u2022 Incorporate essential design principles \u2022 Design authentication and access control for a modern application \u2022 Know the identity management frameworks and protocols used today (OIDC/OAuth 2.0/2.1, SAML 2.0) \u2022 Review historical failures and know how to avoid them."

            "abstract": "\"This text is intended to provide undergraduate and first year graduate students with an introduction to the principles governing the design and performance of rocket propulsion systems. Readers of the text are expected to have a good working knowledge of thermodynamics and the principles of fluid flow in addition to a background in chemistry at least to the college freshman level. Fundamentally, the text has been developed as a compilation of resources from two courses offered at Purdue University: AAE439, Rocket Propulsion and AAE539, Advanced Rocket Propulsion. The former course is taught at the Senior level, while the latter is targeted to Seniors and first year graduate students. The primary emphasis of the text is placed in the area of chemical rocket propulsion systems, the realm that includes solid rocket motors, liquid rocket propulsion devices and hybrid systems that utilize one liquid propellant and one solid propellant. Electric and nuclear propulsion devices are not discussed in detail, but are highlighted briefly within this chapter to place them within the broad context of existing or future rocket propulsion devices. Specifically, this book places emphasis on the propellant systems, combustion processes and thermodynamic and fluid flow processes occurring within the rocket combustion chamber and nozzle. In addition, overall system sizing is presented as well as the interaction of propulsion system performance with vehicle trajectory calculations. Control and structural aspects of a rocket are not considered in detail in this course, but structural issues and sizing considerations are discussed at a mainly conceptual level\"--",

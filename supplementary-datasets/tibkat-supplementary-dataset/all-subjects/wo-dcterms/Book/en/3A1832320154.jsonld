            "abstract": "The second volume of The Papers of Thomas A. Edison, which covers the inventor's life from the end of June 1873 to the end of March 1876, reveals a remarkable diversity of activities and interests. During his late twenties Thomas Edison pursued his pathbreaking work in telegraph technology, formed a business alliance with the notorious financier Jay Gould, and became embroiled in a bitter legal battle over commercial rights to his quadruplex telegraph. Praise for previous volumes of The Papers of Thomas A. Edison:\"The essence of the volume is Edison's technical notebooks, a window onto the inventor's workshop. His lucidity comes through everywhere . . . His writing and drawing come together as a single, vigorous thought process.\"-Russell McCormmach, New York Times.\"A mine of material . . . Scrupulously edited . . . No one could ask for more . . . A choplicking feast for Edison biographers-well into the next century, and perhaps beyond.\"-Fred Howard, Washington Post.\"A triumph of the bookmaker's art, with splendidly arranged illustrations, essential background information, and cautionary reminders of the common sources on which Edison's imagination drew.\"-David Joravsky, New York Review of Books.\"In the pages of this volume Edison the man, his work, and his times come alive . . . A delight to browse through or to read carefully.\"-Thomas J. Misa, Science",

            "abstract": "This book analyses the legal, ethical and social aspects of using deep-learning AI robotic products. The collective effort of distinguished international researchers has been incorporated into one book suitable for the broader audience interested in the emerging scientific field of roboethics. The book has been edited by Prof. George Dekoulis, Aerospace Engineering Institute, Cyprus, expert on state-of-the-art implementations of robotic systems for unmanned spacecraft navigation and other aerospace applications. We hope this book will increase the sensitivity of all the community members involved with roboethics. The significance of incorporating all aspects of roboethics right at the beginning of the creation of a new deep-learning AI robot is emphasised and analysed throughout the book. AI robotic systems offer an unprecedented set of virtues to the society. However, the principles of roboethical design and operation of deep-learning AI robots must be strictly legislated, the manufacturers should apply the laws and the knowledge development of the AI robots should be closely monitored after sales. This will minimise the drawbacks of implementing such intelligent technological solutions. These devices are a representation of ourselves and form communities like us. Learning from them is also a way to improve ourselves",

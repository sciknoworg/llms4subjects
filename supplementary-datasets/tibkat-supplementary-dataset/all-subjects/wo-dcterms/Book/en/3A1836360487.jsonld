            "abstract": "This chapter will take as an example a particular change in healthcare financing at the meso-level: Diagnosis-Related Groups. DRGs marked a shift in the way hospitals were oriented and were the means to operationalise the market-logic in healthcare. The DRG system is a case classification system: each hospital case is related to a \u2018pre-standardised product\u2019 of treatment. Depending on how a patient\u2019s case is encoded, the hospital is reimbursed for the services provided. In this way, hospital care can be matched with pre-calculated resources. Case volumes can be predetermined according to the profit needs of a hospital and an economy\u2019s \u2018healthcare sector\u2019 as a whole. Developed in the early 1980s by Robert B. Fetter and John D. Thompson, a management and a public health scholar at Yale, DRGs were first introduced in New Jersey, and have become the key accounting system throughout Western and increasingly LMI countries\u2019 healthcare systems. (Mathauer and Wittenbecher 2013) Here I will particularly draw on examples from Germany, Switzerland and Scandinavia, but also to the NHS in England",

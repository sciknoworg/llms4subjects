            "abstract": "Theorises how people can judge and respond to their complicity in injustice and violenceAddresses the urgent challenge of how people can respond to widespread complicity in injustice, including phenomena such as racism, social inequality, and the destruction of the environmentCombines Hannah Arendt's account of political judgement and Margaret Archer's theory of social conditioning to throw new light on the problem of complicity from a critical theory and a moral-legal philosophical perspectiveProvides a case study of plastic pollution to illustrate what an improved way of judging complicity might look likeAnalyses the interviews and writings of Nobel Laureate Herta M\u00fcller, whose complex relationship with complicity during the Romanian dictatorship constitutes an example of good judgement on complicityHow can those profiting from inequality, racism, human rights violations and climate change respond to their complicity in injustice and violence? In this book, Gisli Vogler argues that we need an improved conception of judging complicity under conditions of both plurality and inescapable social conditioning.Bringing Hannah Arendt's account of political judgement into dialogue with Margaret Archer's theory of social conditioning, Vogler formulates a new framework - what he terms an 'ethos of reality' - for understanding how people may judge and respond to their entanglement in injustice and violence. Such a theoretical argument is tested through a case study on the complicity of consumers in the plastic pollution caused by the food and drink industries. Additionally, Vogler analyses the interviews and writings of Nobel Laureate Herta M\u00fcller, whose lived experience of the Romanian dictatorship constitutes an example of good judgement on complicity. This book persuasively demonstrates the potential for an 'ethos of reality' to contribute to key contemporary debates on complicity and moral responsibility",

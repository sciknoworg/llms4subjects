            "abstract": "Humor and Irony as a Means of Combating Atheism in the Discourse of F.M. Dostoevsky . The question of the God\u2019s existence troubled Dostoevsky throughout his life. He created a very convincing portrait of the atheist of his time. He did not consider unbelievers immoral, but only \u201cinfected with recklessness\u201d, and when speaking of his atheist acquaintances, often admitted that they were good people. Dostoevsky created the image of an atheist as an intelligent person, who is guided not by the heart, but by the mind and who often evokes sympathy for his questing, his thinking, and his suffering (like Versilov or Ivan Karamazov). If we carefully consider the \u201catheistic\u201d characters of Dostoevsky, however, we will see that atheism is a phenomenon associated with something both bad and funny. Through humorous details, Dostoevsky imperceptibly creates an image of the \u201catheist\u201d as a comical and frivolous person",

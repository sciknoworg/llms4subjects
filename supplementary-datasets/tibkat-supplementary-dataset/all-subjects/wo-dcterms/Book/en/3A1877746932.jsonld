            "abstract": "The progress in modern tiny multifunctional wireless devices has dramatically increased the demand for microstrip antennas in recent years. Furthermore, in the last few years, such microstrip antennas found numerous applications in both the military and the commercial sectors. Therefore, microstrip patch antenna has become a major focus to the researchers in the field of antenna engineering. In this book, some recent advances in microstrip antennas are presented. This book contains mainly three sections. In the first section, some new approaches to modern analytical techniques rather than the conventional cavity model, transmission line model, or spectral domain analysis have been discussed. In the second section of the book, a light has been showered on some new techniques for bandwidth enhancement of microstrip radiators. In the last section of the book, the recent trends in microstrip antenna research have been showcased. Some newfangled application-oriented approach to this field is vividly discussed. The book\u2019s main objective is to facilitate the microstrip antenna researchers for exploring the subject in more vibrant manner and also to revolutionize wireless communications. A suf\ufb01cient number of topics have been covered, some for the \ufb01rst time in a research handbook. I hope that the book will surely be beneficial for scientists, practicing engineers, and researchers working in the field of microstrip antennas",

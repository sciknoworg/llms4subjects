            "abstract": "New teachers entering the profession are said to bring with them enthusiasm, idealism and recent training \u2013 a promising combination for innovative teaching. However, these early career teachers are also commonly portrayed as professionals facing exceptional challenges, with fragile identities who leave the career in high proportions. Can these new teachers help schools to innovate while trying to perform as effective teachers during their initial years? This paper argues that the difficulties most early career teachers encounter, which have largely remained unchanged over the last 50 years, are embedded characteristics of the teaching profession. Further, it discusses the importance of the first five years of the teacher career in acquiring critical professional skills, and highlights the importance of context over experience per se. The paper concludes by making the case that these first five years could work as a residency for early career teachers \u2013 similar to that of medical training \u2013 where they could receive support to experiment in sheltered environments. This professional residency might represent a policy milestone in the building of a continuum of teachers\u2019 professional growth and development.",

                "\"Soft Errors: From Particles to Circuits covers all aspects of the design, use, application, performance, and testing of parts, devices, and systems and addresses every perspective from an engineering, scientific, or physical point of view. \u2026 Many good texts have been written on similar subjects, but none as thorough, as clear, and as complete as this volume. \u2026 [The authors] have mastered the past, absorbed the present, and captured the trends of the future in one of the most important technologies of our time. \u2026 An extremely useful text that has succeeded in presenting with clarity a complex reality in accessible, understandable, and helpful terms.\"-Epaminondas G. Stassinopoulos, Emeritus, NASA/GSFC, USA\"The few radiation effects books out there are focused on space environments or simply on MOSFET degradation. This book\u2026is focused on the terrestrial environment and goes from basic physics and devices to final product applications, and thus should appeal to a much broader audience than other texts. \u2026 This book goes a long way in educating future and existing engineers on how to determine the causes and magnitude of the problems in such systems. \u2026 [This book's strengths are its] focus on the terrestrial environment and the breadth of coverage from particle to device including characterization and modeling techniques.\"-Robert Baumann, Texas Instruments, Dallas, USA ]]>."

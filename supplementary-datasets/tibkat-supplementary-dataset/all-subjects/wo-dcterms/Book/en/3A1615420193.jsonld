                "\"Aviation Logistics looks at the function of the air cargo business and its role in global supply chains and logistics. As global economies are constantly evolving, the supply chain business with its transport partners must be proactive for the future. Technology and its resulting efficiency and transparency are therefore a central part of this book. Aviation Logistics examines how carriers are coming up with new methods and technologies to improve ground handling and road transport, traceability systems and barcoding, security and screening, and safe delivery of perishable items (such as in the pharmaceutical and medical sectors). Endorsed by The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA), Aviation Logistics is supplemented with case studies and contributions from a team of experts including Oliver Evans and Stan Wraight, both industry experts\"--",
                "\"Air transportation is a vital component of the supply chain network, handling over 49 million tons of cargo and 35 percent of exported goods by value in 2013, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). However, it is also extremely expensive to ship via air freight, making it essential that air operations are as efficient as possible to justify this cost.In Aviation Logistics, transportation consultant Michael Sales looks at the close relationship between the rapidly evolving global logistics industry and the aviation industry to achieve this smooth conveyance of goods.  Sales also examines how carriers are coming up with new methods and technologies to improve ground handling and road transport, traceability systems and barcoding, security and screening, and safe delivery of perishable items (such as in the pharmaceutical and medical sectors).  The book is supplemented with case studies and a panel of experts who contribute to the final chapter on future trends. \"--"

            "abstract": "While the advantages of leveraging advanced technologies and Industry 4.0 for effective safety management have been extensively recognized, the journey towards a more mature integration of Industry 4.0 technologies into safety management practices often lacks a well-defined and systematic guidance map. This research is a step towards providing organizations with a structured approach to navigate and achieve successful safety management transformation, enabling them to fully harness the potential of industry 4.0 technologies in the workplace. Two rounds of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are conducted to narrow down the number of articles based on the PRISMA method, which are then subjected to further content analysis. The study highlights the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies within the domains of People, Process, and Policy and their significance in advancing safety maturity. This research uncovered key themes, providing valuable insights that will shape the conceptual maturity model structure of safety management based on the innovative nature of Industry 4.0 to enhance their safety culture to align with. The results provide a fertile ground for a Smart Safety Maturity Model, to integrate technologies to elevate safety drivers in construction safety management",

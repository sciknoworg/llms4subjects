            "abstract": "This issue covers, in the form of abstracts, the work which has been reported between the previous retrospective and the end of 2001. The choice of abstracts is guided by criteria such as accessibility, data content and description of important new techniques, phenomena or anomalies. But there is also a thorough coverage of more qualitative features of diffusion and defect phenomena, computer modelling and theory. The volume also includes, as usual, a number of invited review and experimental papers which treat a wide range of topics in the field.The more theoretical review papers presented here cover the modelling of intergranular segregation and diffusion in alloys, as well as the impact of electron theory. The more practical aspects of diffusion are described by reviews concerning interdiffusion in coatings and long-term thermomechanical behaviour. This volume also contains a dozen papers which were inspired by a Summer School on Mechanical Spectroscopy, held at Aussois (France) in mid-2001: the participants were given the opportunity to present their recent results in the form of poster sessions. As a result, 26 papers were selected for publication. Those which were particularly relevant to metals research appear in this issue. The remaining papers will be presented as part of the next Annual Retrospective on Ceramics (Defect and Diffusion Forum, Volumes 206-207).Altogether, these conference papers, invited papers and abstracts provide a timely guide to a wide range of important topics in the field of defects, and diffusion processes, in metals",

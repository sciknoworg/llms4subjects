            "abstract": "The book Green, Energy-Efficient and Sustainable Networks provides insights and solutions for a range of problems in the field of obtaining greener, energy-efficient, and sustainable networks. The book contains the outcomes of the Special Issue on \u201cGreen, Energy-Efficient and Sustainable Networks\u201d of the Sensors journal. Seventeen high-quality papers published in the Special Issue have been collected and reproduced in this book, demonstrating significant achievements in the field. Among the published papers, one paper is an editorial and one is a review, while the remaining 15 works are research articles. The published papers are self-contained peer-reviewed scientific works that are authored by more than 75 different contributors with both academic and industry backgrounds. The editorial paper gives an introduction to the problem of information and communication technology (ICT) energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, presenting the state of the art and future trends in terms of improving the energy-efficiency of wireless networks and data centers, as the major energy consumers in the ICT sector. In addition, the published articles aim to improve energy efficiency in the fields of software-defined networking, Internet of things, machine learning, authentication, energy harvesting, wireless relay systems, routing metrics, wireless sensor networks, device-to-device communications, heterogeneous wireless networks, and image sensing. The last paper is a review that gives a detailed overview of energy-efficiency improvements and methods for the implementation of fifth-generation networks and beyond. This book can serve as a source of information in industrial, teaching, and/or research and development activities. The book is a valuable source of information, since it presents recent advances in different fields related to greening and improving the energy-efficiency and sustainability of those ICTs particularly addressed in this book",

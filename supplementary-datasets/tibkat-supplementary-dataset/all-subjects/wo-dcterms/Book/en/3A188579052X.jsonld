            "abstract": "COVID-19 has disrupted all aspects of human life. To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, several efforts have been taken, including by Indonesian scholars abroad. This book entitled Indonesia Post-Pandemic Outlook: Rethinking Health and Economics Post-COVID-19 explores opportunities and innovations to push forward to recover from COVID-19, both in health and economics. Comprising 15 chapters, this book is split into three main themes. The first part, Digital Transformation, focuses on how digital transformation has provided new ways of working in health, Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), financing, and the tourism industry, especially in this post-pandemic era. Second, Building Future Ready Resilient Societies, raises the critical question of how the Indonesian society can be more resilient and future-ready to face a future that changes more rapidly than before, through the lens of food systems, mental health, culture, collaborative leadership, communities, and global supply chains. The last part, Equitable, Sustainable, and Green Development, presents ideas on what it takes to build a more equitable, sustainable, and greener future without sacrificing prosperity. We hope that this book can be a valuable reference for stakeholders, policymakers, as well as society to recover from the pandemic crisis and find better solutions to benefit future generations",

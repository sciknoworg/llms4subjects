            "abstract": "This practical handbook provides a well-founded insight into the complex preparatory work for the realisation of eLearning projects. The book describes how project managers and media authors work as a team to create a script for eLearning that fulfils learning psychology criteria and current multimedia didactics. Tools for designing and writing scripts are presented and evaluated so that a needs-based selection is possible. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. A new chapter on \"Mobile Learning\" shows the latest developments. The draft of instructional videos and the possibilities of the social web are explained in detail. Enriched with valuable tips for work organisation and an outline of the media author's job description, the handbook is aimed at project managers and specialists in companies, further education institutions and multimedia agencies as well as media authors and those who want to become one. Numerous checklists facilitate daily work, e.g. for checking a finished script - a quality assurance measure that helps save time and money. Written directly for everyday professional use, the book uses practical methods and work aids as well as tips and tricks to show how a strong draft and a carefully prepared script make a decisive contribution to the successful production of eLearning applications",

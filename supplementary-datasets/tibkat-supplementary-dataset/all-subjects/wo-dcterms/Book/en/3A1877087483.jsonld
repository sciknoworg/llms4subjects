            "abstract": "\"The fifth edition of Violence: The Enduring Problem continues the process of refining our attempt to write a broad interdisciplinary book that analyzes the patterns and correlates of interpersonal and collective violence using the most contemporary research, theories, and cases. We believe that we have succeeded in creating a book that should help you make better sense of the nature and dynamics of a variety of different, yet connected, forms of violence. Relying on a wide range of contemporary and historical sources, we explore a number of different types of individual and collective violence that includes homicide, assault, rape, violence between intimate partners and other family members, robberies, genocide, riots, lynching, and terrorism. The last few years have witnessed a great deal of change in terms of the frequency and dynamics of violent victimization and perpetration. Closely related to this issue, the ways in which crime and violence data are gathered and reported have also often undergone some important alterations, which has ramifications for our ability to track and monitor trends and patterns. This, in turn, has implications for our understanding of the nature of violent behavior and interactions. In this 5th edition, we have worked hard to address both these methodological issues as well as the trends and patterns of violent behavior. Throughout this edition, we have added new examples and case studies, updated all statistics, and provided new discussions on current topical issues. Many discussions from the previous editions have also been enhanced to better reflect the complexities and new developments in those areas. We address, for example, the ways in which terrorism has dramatically changed in recent years (Chapter 10). We also explore in detail the significant increase in mass killing events (Chapter 4), the record high levels of antisemitism and other forms of hate crime including a recent insurgence of hate crimes against Asian Americans (Chapter 8), and highlight some of the connections between these seemingly distinct forms of violence discussed in this book. In fact, throughout the book, we have attempted to more consistently highlight the connections and overlap between different forms of violence, which has always been a central theme of this book. Consequently, we believe that this edition represents a significant step forward in presenting a more complete and contemporary analysis and discussion of violence than is generally found elsewhere\"--",

                "Lourdes Bener\u00eda, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann have combined to produce a major new three-volume research collection that demonstrates the breadth and significance of feminist scholarship in economics. This important selection of articles shows how feminist economics has illuminated our understanding of topics such as household decision-making, the care economy, globalization, the feminization of the labour force, macroeconomics, trade, development, and international migration. Many of the essays provide a feminist perspective on policy and social transformation. The editors have provided an original introduction to the literature, ensuring that these volumes will be an essential source of reference for both students and scholars",

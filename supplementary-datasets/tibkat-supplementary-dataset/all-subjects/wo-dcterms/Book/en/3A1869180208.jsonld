            "abstract": "Arthritis has a high prevalence globally and includes over 100 types; the most common types are rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory arthritis. All types of arthritis share common features, including monocyte infiltration, inflammation, synovial swelling, pannus formation, stiffness in the joints, and articular cartilage destruction. The exact etiology of arthritis remains unclear, and no cure exists as of yet. Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs and corticosteroids) are commonly used for the treatment of arthritis. However, these drugs are associated with significant side effects, such as gastric bleeding and an increased risk of a heart attack and other cardiovascular problems. Therefore, it is crucial that we continue to research the pathogenesis of arthritis and novel modes of therapy. This reprint summarizes and discusses the themes of 19 articles published in our Special Issue \u201cResearch of Pathogenesis and Novel Therapeutics in Arthritis 3.0\u201d. The reprint details important novel research discoveries that contribute to our current understanding of arthritis",

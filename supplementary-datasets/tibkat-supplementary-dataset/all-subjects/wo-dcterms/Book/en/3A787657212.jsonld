            "abstract": "\"A comprehensive reference book codifying the various standards releases for High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) wireless technologyHSPA evolution has maintained its prominence through Releases 7-11 but the evolution is coming to an end with Release 12, with the focus moving to LTE. However, HSPA network and terminal sales will continue for many years: HSPA is expected to remain as the number one radio access technology from the sales point of view far beyond 2015. This timely book examines the complete HSPA evolution, and will be the ultimate long term reference for HSPA evolution.Headed by the successful editing team of Holma, Toskala and Tapia, industry experts look at HSPA evolution including complete Release 11 and the main additions in Release 12. They describe 3GPP definitions, field measurement, expected performance, practical optimization guidelines and the implications to the devices and to the networks. The book also covers MIMO antenna solutions and multicarrier evolution to provide higher data rates. Dedicated chapters include Continuous Packet Connectivity and High Speed Common Channels which provide major improvement to the smartphone capacity, end user performance and power consumption. The book assumes basic understanding of mobile communications yet the material is presented in an understandable way which can be enjoyed without any pre-information about MIMO or other technology solutions.  A comprehensive reference book codifying the various standards releases for High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) wireless technology  Leading editor and contributor team focusing their expertise on 3GPP features and performance, including Self Organizing Networks, LTE Interworking, Smartphone Optimization and Voice Evolution  Dedicated chapter covering VoIP over HSPA, recognizing that telephony will continue to bring most of the revenues to mobile operators in the near future  Includes tables, figures and plots illustrating the concepts or simulation results, to aid readers' understanding of the topic  An essential resource for R&D engineers by network, terminal and chip set vendors, network engineers with operators, application developers, regulators\"--",

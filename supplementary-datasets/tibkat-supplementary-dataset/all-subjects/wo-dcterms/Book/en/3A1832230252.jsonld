            "abstract": "Professor Tribelsky's accomplishments are highly appreciated by the international community. The best indications of this are the high citation rates of his publications, and the numerous awards and titles he has received. He has made numerous fundamental contributions to an extremely broad area of physics and mathematics, including (but not limited to) quantum solid-state physics, various problems in light-matter interaction, liquid crystals, physical hydrodynamics, nonlinear waves, pattern formation in nonequilibrium systems and transition to chaos, bifurcation and probability theory, and even predictions of the dynamics of actual market prices. This book presents several extensions of his results, based on his inspiring publications",

            "abstract": "\"The book is a concise guide dealing with the subject of air turbulence and its methods of detection with particular applications to aviation turbulence. It begins with a general description of turbulence and provides a background into the nature and causes of atmospheric turbulence that affects aircraft motion, giving updates on the state-of-the-art research on clear air turbulence (CAT). Important physical processes leading to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, a primary producer of CAT, are also explained. The several categories of CAT along with its impact on commercial aviation are also presented in a separate chapter, with particular emphasis on the structural damages to planes and injury trends. The central part of the book describes both the earlier and the latest CAT detecting methods and techniques for remote and in situ sensing and forecasting. A concise presentation of new technologies for reducing aviation weather-related accidents is also offered. A chapter on the weather accident prevention project of the NASA aviation safety program is also included. Additionally, the book ends with a full description of the recent research activities on CAT and future challenges in turbulence detection, prediction and avoidance. Since atmospheric turbulence is a major hazard in the aviation industry that may cause serious injuries to passengers and crew, understanding the generation mechanisms of CAT is of fundamental importance for the development of new forecasting algorithms that will help reducing the impact of CAT on the aviation industry. Air Turbulence and Its Methods of Detection offers a concise presentation of the most recent advances in the understanding of air turbulence generation along with the more recent CAT detection and warning methods, making it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers working in the dynamics, detection and prediction of CAT\"--",

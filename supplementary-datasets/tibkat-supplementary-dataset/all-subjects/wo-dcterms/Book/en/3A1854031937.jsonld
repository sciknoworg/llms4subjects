                "\u201cFree the piggies!\u201d \u2014The New York Press \u201cReed has captured the state of the farm today.\u201d \u2014The Fort Myers News-Press \u201cA dizzying feat of writing and scholarship.\u201d \u2014Lynne Tillman \u201cOne plays this terrifying guessing game of animal a clef: which animal am I? Which animal is my neighbor?\u201d \u2014Jonathan Ames This book is the first and definitive reassessment of George Orwell, twenty-first century, written by an author at the nexus of Orwell's controversial literary, political and historical legacies. In The Never End, rabble-rouser, dogged investigator, and consummate literary stylist John Reed collects two decades of subject-Orwell findings published in Pank, Guernica, Literary Hub, The Brooklyn Rail, The Rumpus, The New York Press, The Believer, Harper\u2019s Magazine and The Paris Review. Reed\u2019s treatment of Orwell is corrective and peerlessly contemporary; he views Orwell in a twenty-first century global context, considering Orwell\u2019s collaboration with Cold War intelligence operations\u2014US and UK\u2014with unfaltering objectivity. It\u2019s hard to imagine that Orwell\u2014in our own moment of global doublethink\u2014wouldn\u2019t have wanted his devotion to contrariety applied to the literary legacy he left behind. Animal Farm, based on a previously unknown Russian short story? Animal Farm, deployed by the CIA, MI6 and the Congress for Cultural Freedom? Orwell, turning over blacklists in a McCarthy-esque act of betrayal? The Cold War? Does it last forever? Russia, the \u201cAxis of Evil,\u201d and now China? But. Orwell. Course syllabi. Literary laurels. Snitch. Why do we keep coming back? For the wrong reasons? Or because we know Old Benjamin would want us to know the truth? John Reed, associate professor and the current director of the MFA in Creative Writing at The New School University, is the author of numerous works, including Snowball's Chance, the unauthorized companion to Animal Farm. He\u2019s contributed to, among other venues: Slate, The Paris Review, The Times Literary Supplement, The Wall Street Journal, Vice, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and Harper\u2019s Magazine. He holds an MFA in Creative Writing from Columbia University."

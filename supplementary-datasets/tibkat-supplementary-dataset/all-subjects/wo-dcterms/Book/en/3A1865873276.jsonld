            "abstract": "Operating in environments marked by fragility, conflict, and violence poses complex and distinct challenges, and the Palestinian case is no different. A significant body of literature has emphasized the specific bottlenecks that exist, ranging from - in the first place - the movement, access, trade, and investment restrictions imposed by the Government of Israel (GoI) on the West Bank, and the near-blockade of Gaza, the noncontiguous geography of the territories, to the program advanced by the Palestinian Authority on structural reforms lacking momentum, and increasing penury of foreign aid. Numerous analytical and policy papers - spanning at least three decades, since the establishment of the AHLC forum - have emphasized the severity of the challenges at hand and the imperative of fostering cooperation among all parties. Despite relative clarity on the objectives, progress on the implementation of priorities has been modest, resulting in increased complexity and urgency at the present day. At the behest of the AHLC, this report aims to guide the renewed efforts of the PA and the GoI, the global community, and - more broadly - all relevant policymakers and stakeholders, as they lay the groundwork for sustainable growth and shared prosperity in the Palestinian territories and the wider region. In line with the above, the findings of this report are unsurprising. Unlocking the economic potential of the West Bank and Gaza requires urgent action, in order to spur per capita growth beyond near-stagnation levels, as well as to put the fiscal situation on a sounder footing. The removal, or at least a significant reduction, of restrictions by Israel is a vital prerequisite. Simultaneously, steadfast commitment by the PA to the implementation of a comprehensive reform agenda will be paramount to bolster both recovery and resilience, along with reinforcing institutional governance. In addition, as this report indicates, addressing shortfalls in the health sector will be pivotal to improve the efficiency of public spending, safeguarding human capital, improving service delivery, and revitalizing economic opportunities in a context marked by decades of fragility. While underscoring the burning pressure of these challenges, the World Bank remains fully committed to continuing its close technical collaboration with the PA, the GoI, and all relevant development partners, to help forging a path towards stability, security, economic progress and prosperity, and to contribute to the collective aspiration for a brighter future",

                "The convergence of 1) the intensification of space exploration and 2) the increasing understanding of the world at the atomic and molecular level, nanotechnology, has resulted in a synergy of discoveries and innovations. The result of this synergy may result in leaps in the exploration beyond the surface of the earth but also improve life on our home planet. The content describes the challenge of escaping the earth\u2019s surface, remaining in orbits around our planet, and landing and surviving on worlds away. The associated space environments and variables are covered in general terms and not in an encyclopedic manner. Discoveries in the nanotechnology arena as they can be applied to space exploration are also covered in an understandable manner. This book is a must for people who are working in the \u201cspace\u201d industry who need to know not only more about the many aspects of their industry but also must understand nano-scale implications for the future. Likewise, participants in the nanotechnology arena who want to understand the challenges of space exploration will find critical information in this text.",

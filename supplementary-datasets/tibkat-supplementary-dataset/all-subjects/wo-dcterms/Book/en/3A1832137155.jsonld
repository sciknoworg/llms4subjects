Another objective is to identify research challenges and opportunities in the area spanning the intersection of HPC and ML. In fact, further collaboration between the HPC and ML communities is encouraged for rapid and seamless progress toward an ecosystem that effectively serves both of these communities. Furthermore, new tools and benchmarks are required to overcome the common challenges across HPC and ML applications. The goals of this form of convergence are fourfold: 1. Obtain optimized solutions that show discernible reduction in compute requirements. 2. Facilitate having a more dynamic view of domain sciences. 3. Develop integrated knowledge through interdisciplinary collaboration. 4. Stimulate innovations with deep societal impact through the provisioning of new advances in scientific research spanning many application areas\"--",

                "The present volume, with the exception of the introductory chapter, consists of papers delivered at the workshop entitled \"The Impact of Supercomputers on the Next Decade of Computational Fluid Dynamics,\" The workshop, which took place in Jerusalem, Israel during the week of December 16, 1984, was initiated by the National Science Foundation of the USA (NSF), by the Ministry of Science and Development, Israel (IMSD), and co-sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Office of Scientific Research of the U.S. Air Force (AFOSR), Tel Aviv University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The introductory chapter attempts to summarize what transpired at the workshop. The genesis of the workshop was an agreement between NSF and Il1S, signed in the spring of 1983, to conduct a series of bi-national work\u00ad shops and symposia. This workshop represented the first activity spon\u00ad sored under the agreement. The undersigned were selected by their respective national bodies to act as co-coordinators and organizers of the workshop. The first question that we faced was to decide upon a topic. In the past few years the field of CFD has mushroomed and consequently there have been many meetings, symposia, workshops, congresses, etc."

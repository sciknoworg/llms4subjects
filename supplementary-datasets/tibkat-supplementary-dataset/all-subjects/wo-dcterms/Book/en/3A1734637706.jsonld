            "abstract": [
                "This book explores the Europeanisation of gender policies and addresses some of the challenges of the debates surrounding the EU\u2019s impact on domestic politics. Using Turkey as a case study, it illustrates that Europeanisation needs a feminist agenda and perspective. The first part of the book critically engages with the literature on Europeanisation, the EU\u2019s gender policies and gender policymaking, and the interaction between Europeanisation and gender policies to argue that the Europeanisation framework falls short in devising sustainable gender policies due to a lack of feminist rationale and theory. Subsequently, the book develops a feminist framework of Europeanisation by drawing on the work of key feminist philosophers (Carole Pateman, Onora O\u2019Neill, Nancy Fraser, Anne Phillips, Iris Young) and uses this framework to offer a critique of the Europeanisation of gender policies in various areas where the EU has prompted changes to domestic policies, including in civil society, political representation, private sector, violence against women, education, and asylum policy. Rahime S\u00fcleymano\u011flu-K\u00fcr\u00fcm is Assistant Professor at the Department of Political Science and International Relations at Bah\u00e7e\u015fehir University, Turkey. She is also an associate member of the Nottingham Interdisciplinary Centre for Economic and Political Research (NICEP). Her research focusses on Europeanisation, EU foreign policy, Turkish foreign policy, gendering EU studies, and gender and diplomacy. She is the author of Conditionality, the EU and Turkey: From Transformation to Retrenchment(2019). F. Melis Cin is Lecturer in Education and Social Justice at Lancaster University, UK. She is a feminist researcher with a particular interest in exploring the relationship between education, peace and international development. She is the author of Gender Justice, Education and Equality: Creating Capabilities for Girls\u2019 and Women\u2019s Development (2017) and the co-editor of Youth, Gender and the Capabilities Approach to Development (with A. Lopez-Fogues, 2018).",

            "abstract": "The introduction of opening clauses in collective wage agreements allowing firms to deviate from their collective bargaining agreements has become widely accepted for the last fifteen years. With respect to the flexibility agreed through collective bargaining, the distinctions between single collective bargaining areas of the same industry have increased. Hence, the economic idea of uniform industry-wide central collective bargaining agreements is no longer tenable. The data set of the IAW used in this article provides differentiated information about opening clauses in collective wage agreements. By means of correspondence and cluster analysis, seven groups of collective bargaining areas are identified, which differ in the type of opening clauses introduced. Over the period from 1991 until 2004, the examination of dynamic aspects of these seven groups exhibits typical paths of development towards an improved flexibility agreed through collective bargaining. Furthermore, the conjunction of the data set with the German Structure of Earnings Survey of the years 1995 and 2001 makes it possible to show the relevance of the different types of single collective bargaining areas for employment and industries of the German manufacturing sector.",

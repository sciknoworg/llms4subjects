            "title": "Computed Tomography : Clinical Applications",
            "abstract": "Computed Tomography (CT), and in particular multi-detector-row computed tomography (MDCT), is a powerful non-invasive imaging tool with a number of advantages over the others non- invasive imaging techniques. CT has evolved into an indispensable imaging method in clinical routine. It was the first method to non-invasively acquire images of the inside of the human body that were not biased by superimposition of distinct anatomical structures. The first generation of CT scanners developed in the 1970s and numerous innovations have improved the utility and application field of the CT, such as the introduction of helical systems that allowed the development of the \"volumetric CT\" concept. In this book we want to explore the applications of CT from medical imaging to other fields like physics, archeology and computer aided diagnosis. Recently interesting technical, anthropomorphic, forensic and archeological as well as paleontological applications of computed tomography have been developed. These applications further strengthen the method as a generic diagnostic tool for non- destructive material testing and three-dimensional visualization beyond its medical use",

            "abstract": "\"Generalized Linear Mixed Models: Modern Concepts, Methods and Applications (2nd edition) presents an updated introduction to linear modeling using the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) as the overarching conceptual framework. For students new to statistical modeling, this book helps them see the big picture - linear modeling as broadly understood and its intimate connection with statistical design and mathematical statistics. For readers experienced in statistical practice, but new to GLMMs, the book provides a comprehensive introduction to GLMM methodology and its underlying theory. Unlike textbooks that focus on classical linear models or generalized linear models or mixed models, this book covers all of the above as members of a unified GLMM family of linear models. In addition to essential theory and methodology, this book features a rich collection of examples using SAS\u00ae software to illustrate GLMM practice. This second edition is updated to reflect lessons learned and experience gained regarding best practices and modelling choices faced by GLMM practitioners. New to this edition are two chapters focusing on Bayesian methods for GLMMs\"--",

                "This book provides practical guidance and awareness for a growing body of knowledge developing across a variety of disciplines. This initiative is a celebration of the Gavriel Salvendy International Symposium (GSIS) and provides a survey of topics and emerging areas of interest in human\u2013automation interaction. This set of articles for the GSIS emphasizes a main thematic area: transportation. Main areas of coverage include Section A: Interaction with Vehicle Automation; Section B: HCI in Automated Vehicles; Section C: Trust in Vehicle Automation; Section D: Physical Modeling of Vehicle Cabs; Section E: Task Simulation Automation via Digital Human Models; Section F: Maintenance and Manufacturing; Section G: Smart Cities and Connected Vehicles. Contributions from especially early career researchers were featured as part of this (virtual) symposium and celebration. Gavriel Salvendy initiated the conferences that run annually as Human\u2013Computer Interaction within LNCS of Springer and Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics International (AHFE). The book is inclusive of human\u2013computer interaction and human factors and ergonomics principles, yet it is intended to serve a much wider audience that has interest in automation and human modeling. The emerging need for human\u2013automation interaction expertise has developed from an ever-growing availability and presence of automation in our everyday lives. This initiative is intended to provide practical guidance and awareness for a growing body of knowledge developing across a variety of disciplines and many countries.",

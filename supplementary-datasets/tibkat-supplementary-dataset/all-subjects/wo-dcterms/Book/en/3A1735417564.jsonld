            "abstract": "Create a world-class MongoDB cluster that is scalable, reliable, and secure. Comply with mission-critical regulatory regimes such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Whether you are thinking of migrating to MongoDB or need to meet legal requirements for an existing self-managed cluster, this book has you covered. It begins with the basics of replication and sharding, and quickly scales up to cover everything you need to know to control your data and keep it safe from unexpected data loss or downtime. This book covers best practices for stable MongoDB deployments. For example, a well-designed MongoDB cluster should have no single point of failure. The book covers common use cases when only one or two data centers are available. It goes into detail about creating geopolitical sharding configurations to cover the most stringent data protection regulation compliance. The book also covers different tools and approaches for automating and monitoring a cluster with Kubernetes, Docker, and popular cloud provider containers.   What You Will Learn  Get started with the basics of MongoDB clusters Protect and monitor a MongoDB deployment Deepen your expertise around replication and sharding Keep effective backups and plan ahead for disaster recovery Recognize and avoid problems that can occur in distributed databases Build optimal MongoDB deployments within hardware and data center limitations  Who This Book Is For Solutions architects, DevOps architects and engineers, automation and cloud engineers, and database administrators who are new to MongoDB and distributed databases or who need to scale up simple deployments. This book is a complete guide to planning a deployment for optimal resilience, performance, and scaling, and covers all the details required to meet the new set of data protection regulations such as the GDPR. This book is particularly relevant for large global organizations such as financial and medical institutions, as well as government departments that need to control data in the whole stack and are prohibited from using managed cloud services.",

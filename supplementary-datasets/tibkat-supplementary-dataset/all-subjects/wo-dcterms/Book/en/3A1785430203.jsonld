                "One wants to preserve history. Another seeks to resurrect a legendary army. A third plans to infuse the past with technology to save millions. If you could go back in time, what would you do? Something strange is going on at ChronoCorp. Coffin-shaped pods and glowing talismans, feathered dinosaurs and ancient murals; the private laboratory\u2019s quirky scientists have been quite busy, indeed. The reason? Katya, Xavier, Todd, and colleagues are on a singular scientific mission: to surpass the limits of modern physics and unlock the power of time travel. Their early experiments have proved a resounding success, taking them to far-flung places in both time and space, from nineteenth-century New York to ancient Thera. But as their research progresses, the stakes get ever higher. Enter a world of competing interests and conflicting timelines, where nothing is quite what it seems. Why is Xavier acting so oddly? Where exactly did their eccentric benefactor Mila van Dijk get her wealth? What is the Primus Imperium, and what does its mysterious head\u2014known only as \u201cThe Ambassador\u201d\u2014want from them? Come along as the colleagues at ChronoCorp and their ragtag allies race to sew up several unravelling timelines, battling those who would harm them in the past and present to preserve what is left of their future."

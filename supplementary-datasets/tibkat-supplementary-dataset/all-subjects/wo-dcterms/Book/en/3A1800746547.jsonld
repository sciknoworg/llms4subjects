                "This fascinating book provides a theoretically informed and empirically rich study of the evolution of European education policy since 1973, highlighting the crucial role that ideas have played in shaping the policy. -Michelle Cini, Professor of European Politics, University of Bristol, UK A comprehensive, compelling analysis of European education policy covering almost 50 years. Marina Cino Pagliarello tracks down painstakingly the role of cognitive structures in framing issues and identifying solutions, and how policy beliefs fit with the broader ideological presuppositions of the time. An original interpretation of education policy that will be read by policy analysts, political scientists, and sociologists. -Claudio M Radaelli, Professor of Comparative Public Policy, UCL, UK This book analyses the transformation of European Education Policy from 1973 to 2020. In doing so, it offers a unique insight into the changes of European education from a predominantly national concern to a supranational policy framework, driven by an economic discourse concerning productivity and employability. The book shows that the idea of the \u201cEurope of Knowledge\u201d did not originate in the Lisbon Strategy of 2000, but rather was the result of a gradual development that started in the mid-1980s. This begun with the establishment of a specific problem definition of education as a solution for Europe\u2019s lack of competitiveness, a definition that was incrementally constructed by the European Commission and the European business community. Highlighting significant and unexplored questions such as the role of European transnational business in education and the role of the \u201cproblem entrepreneur\u201d in defining policy issues, this book will provide a comprehensive perspective on European Education Policy that will be of interest to all students of European Politics, Education Policy, and Public Policy. Marina Cino Pagliarello is Lecturer in Political Economy at the University of Essex, Associate Lecturer at UCL, and Research Associate for LSE Consulting. She has worked as an education policy researcher and specialist with national/international organisations and governments for over 15 years. Her research focuses on the role of political and economic actors in shaping public policies.",

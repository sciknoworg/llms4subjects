            "abstract": "Fluid flows are encountered in our daily life as well as in engineering industries. Identifying the temporal and spatial distribution of fluid dynamic properties is essential in analyzing the processes related to flows. These properties, such as velocity, turbulence, temperature, pressure, and concentration, play important roles in mass transfer, heat transfer, reaction rate, and force analysis. However, obtaining the analytical solution of these fluid property distributions is technically difficult or impossible. With the technique of finite difference methods or finite element methods, attaining numerical solutions from the partial differential equations of mass, momentum, and energy have become achievable. Therefore, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has emerged and been widely applied in various fields. This book collects the recent studies that have applied the CFD technique in analyzing several representative processes covering mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, environmental engineering, and thermal engineering",

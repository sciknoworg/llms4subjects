            "abstract": "Following mounting political and social pressures to increase public accessibility to higher education in Israel, in 1994 Israel\u2019s academic arena was transformed from a monolithic system consisting exclusively of research universities to a binary one comprised of both research universities and academic colleges. Within the system\u2019s expansions plans, Israel\u2019s Council for Higher Education prioritized the increased accessibility of higher education to peripheral populations, defining this as a central aim. This transformation was achieved in a short period of time through regional colleges that operated in the periphery and offered professional academic courses. In addition to these institutions, a number of University Extensions operated in Israel, founded based on the American Protestant Colleges model, introduced in Israel in the 1960\u2019s by Bar Ilan University. In 2000 all these institutions were officially included in the country\u2019s higher education system, resulting in a huge increase in the total number of students in academia, with higher education becoming accessible to the country\u2019s social and geographic periphery. This book reviews the evolution of Israel\u2019s academic system and examines the ways in which it has met the national aims defined by the Council for Higher Education in its plans",

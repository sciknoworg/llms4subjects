            "title": "Metaheuristics for Production Systems",
            "abstract": "This book discusses the main techniques and newest trends to manage and optimize the production and service systems. The book begins by examining the three main levels of decision systems in production: the long term (strategic), the middle term (tactical) and short term (operational). It also considers online management as a new level (a sub level of the short term). As each level encounters specific problems, appropriate approaches to deal with these are introduced and explained. These problems include the line design, the line balancing optimization, the physical layout of the production or service system, the forecasting optimization, the inventory management, the scheduling etc.Metaheuristics for Production Systemsthen explores logistic optimization from two different perspectives: internal (production management), addressing issues of scheduling, layout and line designs, and external (supply chain management) focusing on transportation optimization, supply chain evaluation, and location of production. The book also looks at NP-hard problems that are common in production management. These complex configurations may mean that optimal solutions may not be reached due to variables, but the authors help provide a good solution for such problems. The effective new results and solutions offered in this book should appeal to researchers, managers, and engineers in the production and service industries. Prof. El-Ghazali Talbireceived the Master and Ph.D degrees in Computer Science, both from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble in France. Then he became an Associate Professor in Computer Sciences at the University of Lille (France). Since 2001, he is a full Professor at the University of Lille and the head of the optimization group of the Computer Science laboratory (CRISTAL). His current research interests are in the field of multi-objective optimization, parallel algorithms, metaheuristics, combinatorial optimization, cluster and grid computing, hybrid and cooperative optimization, and application to logistics/transportation, bioinformatics and networking.Professor Talbi has to his credit more than 300 publications in journals, chapters in books, and conferences. He is the co-editor of five books. He was a guest editor of more than 10 special issues in different journals (Journal of Heuristics, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, European Journal of Operational Research, Theoretical Computer Science, Journal of Global Optimization). He is the head of the INRIA Dolphin project and the bioinformatics platform of the Genopole of Lille. He has many collaborative industrial, European and international projects. He is the co-founder and the coordinator of the research group dedicated to Metaheuristics: Theory and Applications (META). He is the founding co-chair of the NIDISC workshop on nature inspired computing (IEEE/ACM IPDPS). He served in different capacities on the programs of more than 100 national and international conferences. He was also the conference chair of many conferences (e.g. EA'2005, ROADEF'2006, META'2008, IEEE AICCSA'2010, MIC'2015).Farouk Yalaoui obtained his Engineering degree in Industrial Engineering from the Polytechnics School of Algiers (Algeria) in 1995, his master's degree in Industrial System Engineering from Polytechnics Institute of Lorraine (Nancy, France) in 1997, his Ph.D. degree in Production Management from the Troyes University of Technology (UTT) in 2000 and followed by a Habilitation \u00e0 diriger les recherches(Dr. Hab) from Compiegne University of Technology (UTC) in 2006. He is currently a full Professor at Troyes University of Technology, France, where he is the head of Optimisation Industrial systems Optimisation Lab (Research Team), Charles Dealaunay Institute (ICD), UMR CNRS 6281. His research topic focuses on the scheduling problems, system design, operations research, modeling, analysis and optimization of logistic and production systems, reliability and maintenance optimization and on optimization problems in general.

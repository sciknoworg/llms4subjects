                "A continent of vast geography and comprising more than 50 nation states, Africa has long been an essential crossroads for photographers. Since the advent of the medium in the first half of the 19th century, myriad photographers-indigenous and immigrant, amateur and professional, explorer and colonist - have chronicled the tumultuous transformations of cultural, environmental and political landscapes. Photography and Africa investigates the many themes that intertwine photographs with the circumstances of their production. Presenting a wealth of fascinating and rare images, Erin Haney brings together some of the most vibrant examples captured across the continent. Ranging from royal portraiture in the 19th-century Cape Coast to railway gangs in Uganda, to apartheid-era South African resistance photography and to glimmering cityscapes, this book illustrates the fascinating and pervasive relationship between Africa and photography. The importance of pre- and post-colonial African photographers is stressed, and Haney investigates how the medium has influenced other art forms - painting, sculpture, textiles and public performance - from the 19th century through to today. This powerful and celebratory account of Africa and photography will appeal to all those interested in the medium, and in how the two have interacted and informed each other over time.--Book Jacket"

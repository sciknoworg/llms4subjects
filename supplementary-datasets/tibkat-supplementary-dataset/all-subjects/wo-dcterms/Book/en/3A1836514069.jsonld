            "abstract": "After 9/11 presents 17 interviews with America\u00b4s leading political thinkers. Renowned experts such as Zbigniew Brzezinski, Francis Fukuyama, and Noam Chomsky discuss the nation\u2019s foreign policy in the post-9/11 world. Yet, they also comment on their own role in US society \u2013 and the mounting challenges they face today. The conversations illustrate the hopes and expectations, the anger and frustration, the shattered beliefs and unshakable convictions of the nation\u00b4s preeminent minds \u2013 at a time when America made its epic transition from George W. Bush to Barack Obama. Renowned experts engage in a vibrant debate about their nation\u00b4s position on the global stage: What is America\u00b4s foreign policy in the post-9/11 world? What should it be? What led to the catastrophe of September 11? How best to prevent another one, and how to restore America\u00b4s damaged reputation? What to expect of Obama? While struggling to define their nation\u00b4s role in a world that has changed since the terror attacks, the intellectuals discuss their own role in 21st-century society \u2013 a society that thrives on public discourse. The book is written for students, graduates, and lecturers in political science, sociology, culture studies, philosophy, and history. However, anyone interested not only in the political positions of America\u00b4s most prominent thinkers but also in how these thinkers feel about what they do and how they do it will enjoy this book.

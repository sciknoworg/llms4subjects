                "Every society aspires to be prosperous. It also endeavors to minimize the side effects of economic growth. This book entitled The Economics of Optimal Growth Pathways addresses numerous trade-offs faced by society to achieve prosperity and explores the best possible growth pathways. The theories explored in this book serve as a springboard to better understand key challenges and aspects of the economy, including food security, land use, forest and resource management, capital markets and interest rates, oil and gas extraction, fish and marine resources, saving and investment, and climate change. This book elucidates the concept of optimal economic growth pathways while addressing the challenges faced in natural resources and life on the planet. It will be relevant to students and researchers interested in resource and environmental economics. S. Niggol Seo is a natural resource economist who specializes in the study of global warming and globally shared goods. Born in 1972, he received a PhD degree in environmental and natural resource economics from Yale University in 2006 and has been a professor in the UK, Spain, and Australia from 2006 to 2015. He previously worked on various World Bank projects on climate change in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. He received an Outstanding Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy Article Award from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association in Pittsburgh in June 2011. He is currently at the Muaebak Institute of Global Warming Studies."

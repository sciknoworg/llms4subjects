                "Software is everywhere, but despite being so common and useful, it remains magical and mysterious to many. Still, more and more people are finding themselves working for tech companies, or with an array of software products, services, and tools. This can segregate those who understand tech from those that don\u2019t. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. This book aims to bring these two worlds closer together, allowing people to learn basic concepts of software development in a casual and straight-forward way. Assuming no previous technical knowledge, you\u2019ll embark on a journey where you can understand and build a new software project from scratch until it is an advanced product with multiple users. Imagine moving from a \u201ctraditional\u201d company and suddenly finding yourself in one where software is the main product or is a foundational component to it. One is often left to wade through the infinite concepts while still doing their actual jobs. This book closes that gap, improving communication between technical and non-technical parties. A Friendly Guide to Software Development makes technical concepts broadly available and easy to understand. In doing so, you'll be able to achieve better communication, which will undoubtedly lead to better working relationships, a better working environment, and ultimately better software. You will: See how a new software project is created Examine the basics of software development and architecture Know which questions to ask to avoid potential problems and pitfalls Start using and building software projects."

            "title": "Reconsidering Constitutional Formation II Decisive Constitutional Normativity: From Old Liberties to New Precedence",
            "abstract": "This second volume of ReConFort, published open access, addresses the decisive role of constitutional normativity, and focuses on discourses concerning the legal role of constitutional norms. Taken together with ReConFort I (National Sovereignty), it calls for an innovative reassessment of constitutional history drawing on key categories to convey the legal nature of the constitution itself (national sovereignty, precedence, justiciability of power, judiciary as constituted power). In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, constitutional normativity began to complete the legal fixation of the entire political order. This juridification in one constitutional text resulted in a conceptual differentiation from ordinary law, which extends to alterability and justiciability. The early expressions of this \u2018new order of the ages\u2019 suggest an unprecedented and irremediable break with European legal tradition, be it with British colonial governance or the French ancien r\u00e9gime. In fact, while the shift to constitutions as a hierarchically \u2018higher\u2019 form of positive law was a revolutionary change, it also drew upon old liberties. The American constitutional discourse, which was itself heavily influenced by British common law, in turn served as an inspiration for a variety of constitutional experiments \u2013 from the French Revolution to Napoleon\u2019s downfall, in the halls of the Frankfurt Assembly, on the road to a unified Italy, and in the later theoretical discourse of twentieth-century Austria. If the constitution states the legal rules for the law-making process, then its Kelsian primacy is mandatory. Also included in this volume are the French originals and English translations of two vital documents. The first \u2013 Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s\u2019 Du Jury Constitutionnaire (1795) \u2013 highlights an early attempt to reconcile the democratic values of the French Revolution with the pragmatic need to legally protect the Revolution. The second \u2013 the 1812 draft of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland \u2013 presents the \u2018constitutional propaganda\u2019 of the Russian Tsar Alexander I to bargain for the support of the Lithuanian and Polish nobility. These documents open new avenues of research into Europe\u2019s constitutional history: one replete with diverse contexts and national experiences, but above all an overarching motif of constitutional decisiveness that served to complete the juridification of sovereignty.

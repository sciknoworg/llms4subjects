This book establishes these \u201cidea systems\u201d as an academic concept. Through three intense episodes of manipulation and mayhem connected to idea systems\u2014Europe\u2019s witch hunts, the Mao Zedong-era \u201crevolutions,\u201d and the early campaign of the U.S. War on Terror\u2014this book charts the cognitive and informational matrices that seize control of people\u2019s mentalities and behaviors across societies. Through these, the author reaches two conclusions. The first, that we are all vulnerable to the dominating influence of our own matrices of ideas and to those woven by others in the social system. The second, that even the most masterful manipulators of idea programs may lose control of the outcomes of programmatic manipulation. Amongst this analysis, sixty-plus central conceptual terminologies are provided for readers to analyze multiform idea systems that exist across space, time, and cultural contexts.

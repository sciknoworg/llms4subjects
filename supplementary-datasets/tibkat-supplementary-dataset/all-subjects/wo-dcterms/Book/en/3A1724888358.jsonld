            "abstract": "The Enlaces program has been responsible for the implementation of projects exploring the use of new technologies in education in Chile for over two decades. Born in 1992 as a small pilot project, Enlaces grew and evolved over time to become part of the permanent structure of the country's Ministry of Education. Its implementation strategy can be characterized as one 'from the periphery to the center', both in its territorial deployment and in the manner in which it was gradually institutionalized. The main focus of Enlaces has been to support the computerization of schools and to support teachers to incorporate the technology into their teaching practices. For most of its history, Enlaces has enjoyed committed political and financial support from Chile's national education authorities From its inception, Enlaces has been built on strategic alliances with regional universities, schools, and the private sector, each of which has played a leading role in the development and success of Enlaces. The program's commitment to follow a 'logical path' by supporting traditional structures and actors within the education sector, resulted in a slower implementation of new technologies in schools than in many comparator countries, and over time the program struggled to demonstrate significant impacts on educational outcomes, as traditional educational practices did not change significantly. As its program became institutionalized with the Ministry of Education, Enlaces became more embedded within, and dependent on, official bureaucratic structures and education policies, constraining the ability to innovate and remain flexible which character its early years",

                "Mathematics research opportunities for undergraduate students have grown significantly in recent years, but accessible research topics for first- and second-year students are still hard to find. To address this need, this volume provides beginning students who have already had some exposure to calculus with specific research projects and the tools required to tackle them. Chapters are self-contained, presenting projects students can pursue, along with essential background material and suggestions for further reading. In addition to calculus, some of the later chapters require prerequisites such as linear algebra and statistics. Suggested prerequisites are noted at the beginning of each chapter. Some topics covered include: lattice walks in the plane statistical modeling of survival data building blocks and geometry modeling of weather and climate change mathematics of risk and insurance Mathematics Research for the Beginning Student, Volume 2 will appeal to undergraduate students at two- and four-year colleges who are interested in pursuing mathematics research projects. Faculty members interested in serving as advisors to these students will find ideas and guidance as well. This volume will also be of interest to advanced high school students interested in exploring mathematics research for the first time. A separate volume with research projects for students who have not yet studied calculus is also available."

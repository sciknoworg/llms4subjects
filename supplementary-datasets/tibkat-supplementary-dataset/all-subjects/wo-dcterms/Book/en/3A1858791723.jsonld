                "Improve cloud security within your organization by leveraging AWS\u2019s Shared Responsibility Model, Well-Architected Framework, and the Cloud Adoption Framework. This book will show you to use these tools to make the best decisions for securing your cloud environment. You\u2019ll start by understanding why security is important in the cloud and then review the relevant services offered to meet an organization\u2019s needs. You\u2019ll then move on to the finer points of building a secure architecture and take a deep look into the differences of responsibility of managed services and those that allow customers more control. With multiple AWS services available, organizations must weigh the tradeoffs between those that provide granular control (IaaS), a managed service (PaaS), delivering applications remotely over the internet instead of locally on machines (SaaS). This book will help you to identify the appropriate resources and show you how to implement them to meet an organization\u2019s business, technical, and security perspective in the Cloud Adoption Framework. Finally, you'll see how organizations can launch a secure and optimized cloud architecture and use monitoring tools to be proactive in security measures. With Beginning AWS Security, you'll understand frameworks, models, and the services needed to build a secure architecture. You will: Review the similarities and differences between cloud and traditional computing. See how security changes when using on-site, hybrid, and cloud models Develop an understanding that security is not \u201cone and done\u201d Reinforce the need for updates and monitoring as a continued part of AWS security."

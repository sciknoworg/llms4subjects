Rather than providing prescriptions for political judgment and action, Ranci\u00e8re focuses on how sensibilities and perceptions constitute dynamic relations between persons and the worlds they create. Panagia traces this approach by examining Ranci\u00e8re's modernist sensibilities, his theory of radical mediation, the influence of Gustave Flaubert on Ranci\u00e8re's literary voice, and how Ranci\u00e8re juxtaposes seemingly incompatible objects and phenomena to create moments of sensorial disorientation. The power of Ranci\u00e8re's work, Panagia demonstrates, lies in its ability to leave readers with a disjunctive sensibility of the world and what political thinking is and can be",

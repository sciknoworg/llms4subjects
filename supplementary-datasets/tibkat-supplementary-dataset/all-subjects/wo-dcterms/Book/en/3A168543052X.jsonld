            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Volume 19 highlights major developments in this area reported up to the end of 2002, with results being set into the context of earlier work and presented as a set of critical yet coherent overviews. The topics covered describe contrasting types of application, ranging from biological areas such as EPR studies of free-radical reactions in biology and medically-related systems, to experimental developments and applications involving EPR imaging, the use of very high fields, and time-resolved methods. Critical and up-to-the-minute reviews of advances involving the design of spin-traps, advances in spin-labelling, paramagnetic centres on solid surfaces, exchange-coupled oligomers, metalloproteins and radicals in flavoenzymes are also included. As EPR continues to find new applications in virtually all areas of modern science, including physics, chemistry, biology and materials science, this series caters not only for experts in the field, but also those wishing to gain a general overview of EPR applications in a given area. Specialist Periodical Reports provide systematic and detailed review coverage in major areas of chemical research.  Compiled by teams of leading authorities in the relevant subject areas, the series creates a unique service for the active research chemist, with regular, in-depth accounts of progress in particular fields of chemistry. Subject coverage within different volumes of a given title is similar and publication is on an annual or biennial basis. NOW AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY - chapters from volumes published 1998 onwards are now available online, fully searchable by key word, on a pay-to-view basis. Contents pages can be viewed free of charge. Visit www.rsc.org/spr for full details",

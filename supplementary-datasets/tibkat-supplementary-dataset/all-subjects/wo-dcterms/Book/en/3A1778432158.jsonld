            "abstract": "Electromagnetic (EM) waves carry energy through propagation in space. This radiation associates with entangled electric and magnetic fields which must exist simultaneously. Although all EM waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum, they cover a wide range of frequencies called the EM spectrum. The various portions of the EM spectrum are referred to by various names based on their different attributes in the emission, transmission, and absorption of the corresponding waves and also based on their different practical applications. There are no certain boundaries separating these various portions, and the ranges tend to overlap. Overall, the EM spectrum, from the lowest to the highest frequency (longest to shortest wavelength) contains the following waves: radio frequency (RF), microwaves, millimeter waves, terahertz, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. This Special Issue consists of sixteen papers covering a broad range of topics related to the applications of EM waves, from the design of filters and antennas for wireless communications to biomedical imaging and sensing and beyond",

            "abstract": "This open access book brings together key issues from transformative processes and events across Europe (and in some cases beyond) from 15,000 to 1 BCE. This volume covers the research output produced by the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1266 \"Scales of Transformation\" \u2013 the first interdisciplinary centre to diachronically investigate transformations in past societies with a summary of their individual aspects from the Late Palaeolithic to the Roman Period. Following the introduction, the book is divided into three main sections: In \"Identification of anatomies of socio-environmental transformation\", the concept of scales of transformations is first explained, and the various parameters of transformational change are identified. This is followed by \"Expressions of socio-environmental transformations: from climate preconditions to decision making\", in which transformation processes are illustrated with individual examples. The third major part of the book deals with\"Perspectives on decision making processes in socio-environmental transformations\". In conclusion, the results are framed in a broad temporal framework, and patterns of socio-environmental change are presented across common time frames from the Eastern Mediterranean to Scandinavia. This book is of interest to researchers in archaeology and palaeoecology",

            "abstract": "\"Traditionally, land surveyors experience years of struggle as they encounter the complexities of project planning and design processes in the course of professional employment or practice. Giving beginners a leg up and working professionals added experience, Geomatics Engineering: A Practical Guide to Project Design provides a practical guide to contemporary issues in geomatics professionalism, ethics, and design. It explores issues they face on a daily basis during the project design and the request for proposal process commonly used for soliciting professional geomatics engineering services. Organized into four sections, designed to develop critical thinking and problem solving, this book: reflects the natural progression of project design considerations, including how the planning, information gathering, design, scheduling, cost estimating, and proposal writing fit into the overall scheme of project design process; presents the details of contemporary issues such as standards and specifications, professional and ethical responsibilities, and policy, social, and environmental issues that are pertinent to geomatics engineering projects; demonstrates the important considerations when planning or designing new projects; and focuses on the proposal development process and shows how to put together a project cost estimate, including estimating quantities and developing unit and lump-sum costs. Based on experience of past projects, the book identifies priority areas of attention for planning new projects. Presenting the nuts and bolts of geomatics projects, the author provides an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, the impact of engineering solutions in a global and social context, as well as a host of other contemporary issues such as budgetary and scheduling constraints.\"--Publisher's description",

As accelerators and its science evolved to meet the ever-increasing needs of society, the field of accelerator physics has progressed and deepened over the past few decades, and many of its branches developed into special topics of research by their own rights. It is appropriate at this time to start accumulating this hard-earned expertise by the accelerators community. With this view, a selection of these special topics is presented in this volume. Although not exhaustive, they are chosen to present accelerator physics as a diversified and exciting field and written based on the author's practical and teaching experiences gathered over the past decades. The book is suitable as an advanced level textbook. The material on each topic has been intended to be self-contained. The reader is assumed to have basic knowledgeable of accelerator physics to put the material in some context\"--",

                "An interdisciplinary edited collection on social science methodologies for approaching Roman legal sourcesRoman law as a field of study is rapidly evolving to reflect new perspectives and approaches in research. Scholars who work on the subject are increasingly being asked to conduct research in an interdisciplinary manner whereby Roman law is not merely seen as a set of abstract concepts devoid of any background, but as a body of law which operated in a specific social, economic and cultural context. This context-based, 'law and society' approach to the study of Roman law is an exciting new field which legal historians must address.This interdisciplinary collection focuses on three larger themes which have emerged from these studies: Roman legal thought the interaction between legal theory and legal practice and the relationship between law and economics.Key FeaturesThis book aims to further the current debate on the interface between legal history and ancient historyIt brings together a distinguished group of scholars who will provide different perspectives on this debateIt addresses particular themes within this debate such as law and legal practice, law and gender as well as law and economics",

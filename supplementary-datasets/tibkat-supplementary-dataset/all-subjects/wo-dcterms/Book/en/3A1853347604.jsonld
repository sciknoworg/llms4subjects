The Special Issue contains contributions concerning different aspects of the use of phenolic plant-derived molecules for prevention and therapy of several diseases, in order to understand the mechanisms involved in their protective role, their bioavailability and their metabolism in human tissue. Moreover, the use of different strategies for extraction, synthesis, and delivery of these compounds, has been covered",

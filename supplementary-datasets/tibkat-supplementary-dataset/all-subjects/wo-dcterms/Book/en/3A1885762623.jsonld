            "abstract": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is an integrated business management system aimed at monitoring and maximizing resources and efficiency; on the other hand, Building Information Modelling (BIM) represents a broad series of approaches to design, based on the development of virtual models that cover the building\u2019s whole lifecycle. The integration of ERP systems within the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry, while promising, has yet to reach the same results that its use has achieved in other fields. Although BIM and ERP are traditionally systems employed in different disciplines, they both deal with data integration and customization, and are designed to reconcile varied and scattered information. A mutual incorporation could allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the project starting from the initial phases, while also granting a more streamlined construction process and a reduction in errors and complications later on. The aim of this paper is to identify the possible connections between the two systems examining a case study, starting from an analysis of the current state of the art regarding this implementation, and by evaluating both the existing limits and the future possibilities of this implementation, for both small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the industry at large",

            "abstract": "\"Preface The problems of information security is a truly multidisciplinary field of study, ranging from the methods of pure mathematics through computer and telecommunication sciences to social sciences. The intention of this multiauthored book is to o er an introduction to a wide set of topics in ICT information security, privacy and safety. Certainly, the aim has not been to present a complete treatment of this vast and expanding area of practical and theoretical knowledge. Rather, the hope is that the selected range of topics presented here may attract a wider audience of students and professionals than would each specialized topic by itself. Some of the information security topics contained in this book may be familiar turf for the reader already. However, the reader will likely also nd some new interesting topics presented here that are relevant to his or her professional needs, or for enhancement of knowledge and competence, or as an attractive starting point for further reading and in-depth studies. For instance, the book may provide an entrance and a guide to seek out more specialized courses available at universities and elsewhere, or as an inspiration for further work in projects and assignments. The start of this collection of information security topics goes back to a master level continuing education course that I organized in 2005, where more than 10 professors and researchers contributed from 6 di erent departments at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The topics included cryptography, hardware security, software security, communication and network security, intrusion detection systems, access policy and control, risk and vulnerability analysis, and security technology management\"--",

                "\"Provides a cost-effective alternative to Finite Element software tools for soil and structural analysisGiving readers the tools to understand and analyse common problems in structural engineering, foundation engineering and soil-structure interaction, this book is accompanied by Excel Spreadsheets and employs the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro programming language to allow a practical understanding. The book demystifies complex soil and structure applications using simple modelling techniques to present the essentials in a clear and concise way.It also shows the theory behind the programming of the finite element method, and how analysis using Excel spreadsheets and VBA macros can be used to test underlying assumptions of FEM tools.  By providing an expert system and guidance to the reader in its use through examples, the text shows how an analysis of any structure or soil-structure system, regardless of complexity, can be conducted. It explains the operations being performed by all the computer programs in a general manner, and any limitations, simplifying assumptions, or approximations inherent in the method. The book also addresses some of the common problems and misunderstandings in the theory and practice of geo-engineering by providing tools to calculate deformations; implement soil-structure interaction procedures for many problems; provide reality checks on more complicated procedures; and enable proper implementation of soil and rock properties in analyses. A hands-on reference enabling readers to efficiently solve problems in the analysis of geotechnical and structural systems using  Excel and VBA macros Uniquely utilises Excel spreadsheets and programming tools to solve practical problems in soil-structure interaction in a cost-effective way Both a self-study guide and a reference, with extensive question and answer sections within chapters, to enable hands-on learning  Includes an Appendix with solutions to practical civil engineering applications Companion website features Matlab coding, Excel spreadsheets and VBA macros \"--",

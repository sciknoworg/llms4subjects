                "\u201cPolitical Marketing in the 2021 Canadian Federal Election provides an insightful and timely contribution to the field of political science and modern political campaigning. It provides a nice balance between practical review and detailed theoretical analysis. The book also covers several topics of growing importance both politically and academically, such as populism, identity and grievance politics, as well as polarisation and negative campaigning. As a result, the book acts as a good marker between the Canadian election campaign strategies of the past and the drastic changes we will likely see moving forward. I highly recommend this book for academics, students and practitioners alike.\u201d --- Edward Elder, Faculty of Arts, University of Auckland, New Zealand \"The 2021 Canadian federal election provided scholars with an extraordinary opportunity to study political marketing as applied during a global health crisis. From how one party galvanized the role of anger, to the hyper masculine focus of marketing the leaders through digital communications, to the challenge faced by party brands in the face of rising populist sentiment on both the left and the right, this collection sheds much needed light on the changing dynamics within the Canadian electorate and how parties use marketing tools - with varying degrees of success - to respond to them. Readers will learn much from the chapters offered here.\" --Anna Esselment, Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Waterloo This book will offer a fresh take on the dynamics of the 2021 Canadian federal election and differentiates from The Canadian General Election book series or other books looking at the campaign horse race and results. It will instead focus on elements pertinent to the political marketing literature. Besides chapters by leading and emerging political marketing academics from different disciplines (e.g. communications, political science, political management), the co-editors of this edited volume have solicited contributions from practitioners in different fields related to political marketing (e.g. polling). Some chapters are collaborations between leading academics and practitioners, which should be a source of new insights into dynamics of political marketing that will make this edited volume unique from others published previously. In other words, the book\u2019s content will be taking our current understandings of Canadian political marketing in new directions.

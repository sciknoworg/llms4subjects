            "abstract": "With its impressive maternal and child health outcomes and control of communicable diseases, Sri Lanka is often depicted as a success story. The primary objectives of this study are to examine the prevalence and distribution of non-communicable disease (NCDs) and risk factors across socioeconomic and demographic groups (in the Western province of Sri Lanka) and assess the performance of the health system with regards to NCDs. The focus is on adult health. The study also looks at patterns of health care use, the choice of public versus private care, and the use of primary level facilities. While the study is focused on the Western province, recommendations apply to the country as a whole. In addition, the study presents data by socio-economic groups, which can allow for tailored approaches to address the growing burden of NCDs. Such disaggregated data are not available in the national health information system and most administrative data systems. This study attempts to fill those gaps. The report is organized as follows: chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two examines the population's health status and the physiological risk factors for NCDs. Chapter three explores behavioral and environmental risk factors. Chapter four reports patterns of health care use. In chapter five, the amount and distribution of out of-pocket payments is explored. Chapter six examines gaps in the existing health system in terms of delivering effective care for NCDs. Finally, chapter seven presents conclusions and recommendations",

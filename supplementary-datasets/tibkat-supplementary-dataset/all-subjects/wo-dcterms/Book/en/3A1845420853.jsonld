            "abstract": "Societal Organization and Globalization in Cultural Anthropology Cultural Anthropology: A Global Perspective provides students with an introduction to cultural anthropology through a traditional holistic and integrative approach.  Organized by societal type, this book's primary emphasis is on applied anthropology, with a strong coverage of globalization.  Additionally, it emphasizes three unifying themes: 1) the diversity of human societies and cultural patterns the world over, 2) the similarities that make all humans fundamentally alike, and 3) the interconnections between the sciences and humanities within anthropology.

Engage Students - Applying Anthropology boxes show students that anthropological research helps solve problems that are currently faced by today\u2019s societies.  Anthropologists at Work boxes profile prominent anthropologists, providing real life examples of many issues covered in the chapters. Support Instructors - Teaching your course just got easier!

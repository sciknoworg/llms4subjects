            "abstract": [
                "The God of classical theism can be characterized by four features: uncausedness, atemporality, pure actuality, and the identity of divine essence and existence. A certain long-standing program in natural theology provides good grounds for accepting the existence of such a being. In this chapter, I focus on three arguments from St. Thomas Aquinas: the First and Second Ways (from the Summa Theologiae Part I), and his analysis of essence and existence in De Ente. These arguments provide support for the existence of a First Cause with all four of the characteristics of classical theism. I also argue that we can go on to infer God's personality, intelligence, infinity, and perfection. Finally, there is little doubt that, if the God of classical theism exists, that unique Being must be identified with the God of the Bible",
                "\"This volume provides a contemporary account of classical theism. It features sixteen original essays from leading scholars that advance the discussion of classical theism in new and interesting directions. It's safe to say that classical theism-the view that God is simple, omniscient, and the greatest possible being-is no longer the assumed view in analytic philosophy of religion. It is often dismissed as being rooted in outdated metaphysical systems of the sort advanced by ancient and medieval philosophers. The main purpose of this volume is twofold: to provide a contemporary account of what classical theism is and to advance the scholarly discussion about classical theism. In Section I, the contributors offer a clear and cutting-edge account of the nature and existence of the God and the historical and theological foundations of classical theism. Section II contains chapters on a variety of topics, such as whether classical theism's doctrine of simplicity needs revision, whether simplicity is compatible with the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation, and whether the hypothesis of a multiplicity of divine ideas is consistent with divine simplicity, among others. Classical Theism will appeal to scholars and advanced students in philosophy of religion who are interested in the nature of God\"--"

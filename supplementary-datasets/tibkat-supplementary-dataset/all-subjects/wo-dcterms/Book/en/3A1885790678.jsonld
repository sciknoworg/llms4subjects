            "abstract": "Nowadays, the use of power converter technology has expanded into a wide range of low-, medium-, and high-power applications due to the technology\u2019s capability to efficiently manage electrical energy. In this regard, the high penetration of modern microprocessors capable of implementing high-performance nonlinear digital controllers and the recent advances in the development of high-speed switching power electronic devices, where on-state loss and consequently switching loss of power semiconductors are significantly decreased, have contributed to increased efficiency of the new power converters. As a result, the size of power converters becomes small and the power converters with less heat generation have little environmental stress. Several power converter topologies have been recently proposed in the literature for a variety of emerging applications. These novel converter topologies have different design criteria as well as particularities associated with the digital control system. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art and addresses recent breakthroughs in a range of power converter technology, with a special emphasis on design, emerging applications, and control",

            "abstract": "There are significant advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cardiac development and the etiology of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, these have not yet evolved to such a degree so as to be useful in preventing CHD at this time. Developments such as early detection of the neonates with serious heart disease and their rapid transport to tertiary care centers, availability of highly sensitive noninvasive diagnostic tools, advances in neonatal care and anesthesia, progress in transcatheter interventional procedures and extension of complicated surgical procedures to the neonate and infant have advanced to such a degree that almost all congenital cardiac defects can be diagnosed and \"corrected\". Treatment of the majority of acyanotic and simpler cyanotic heart defects with currently available transcatheter and surgical techniques is feasible, effective and safe. The application of staged total cavo-pulmonary connection (Fontan) has markedly improved the long-term outlook of children who have one functioning ventricle. This book, I hope, will serve as a rich source of information to the physician caring for infants, children and adults with CHD which may help them provide optimal care for their patients",

In this timely three-volume collection, Randall Parker brings together the most authoritative works written by some of the leading experts in this field. The first volume gives a comprehensive overview of the build-up and immediate aftermath of the initial stages of the Depression while the second volume provides the reader with detailed analyses of the monetary and financial reasons behind this economic catastrophe. The third volume charts the vital research undertaken on the operation of the interwar gold standard, which has deepened our understanding of the Depression and its international character and concludes with an investigation into the economic recovery and the New Deal. This important and highly relevant collection, along with an original introduction by the editor, will be an invaluable reference tool for students, scholars and practitioners with an interest in the economic aspects of the Great Depression"

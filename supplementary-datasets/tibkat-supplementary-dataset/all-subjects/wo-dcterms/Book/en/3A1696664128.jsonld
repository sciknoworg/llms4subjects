            "abstract": [
                "In the global culture of education, game-based learning needs to be an integrated part of formal education, and not just an 'exotic spice' for many educators, as it is today.The critical role of the educator as a facilitator, gatekeeper and enabler of serious games is often downplayed. Therefore a comparison across regions is needed so that we do not limit the potential of transferring best practice, research results and the development of games across borders.This book deals with three key questions: How are serious games understood and designed? How do they establish themselves in learning and education locally? And, how can games as a learning culture be explored in a global perspecitve?.",

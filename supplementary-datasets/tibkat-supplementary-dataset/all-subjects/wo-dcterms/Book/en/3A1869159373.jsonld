            "abstract": "There has been significant growth in branches of industry directly related to new materials, such as metals, polymers, and composite materials. Considering the increase in material costs, it has become exceedingly important to produce lightweight constructions through the use of certified materials with appropriate mechanical properties. Many composite materials, especially in building engineering, are characterized by the use of waste materials, allowing them to meet environmental demands and often also positively affecting the performance (as well as mechanical) properties of the whole construction. A similar phenomenon has been noticed in polymers and metals, with the \u201cecologically friendly\u201d factor having increasing influence in such materials. The main aim of our Special Issue was to gather novel research results concerning different materials available for all important industries\u2014building engineering, the heavy industry, automotive, aerospace, and medicine. Such a general title has been proposed to also include different manufacturing technologies using various materials\u2014conventional (milling, casting, forming, and turning) and novel (hybrid and additive manufacturing)",

            "abstract": "Informed by original ground-breaking research, this book \u201cshifts the lens\u201d of study, identifying how Indigenous Australian values and principles have influenced and contributed to an evolving non-Indigenous mainstream Australian culture. Based on the Indigenous principle of respect, Muller presents a solid research framework to break down the barriers of social differences in a culturally safe space. The text offers an insight into the cultural aspects of modern Australian society that contributed to its globally acclaimed handling of the current coronavirus pandemic. During the preparation for dealing with the pandemic, Muller\u2019s research was validated as the world witnessed the Australian culture undergoing major change, shifting away from the original colonialist culture based on individuality and social stratification, to a community collective-based culture. It will be a valuable read for scholars in the area of community and allied health, humanities, social policy, social sciences and political studies. People seeking alternative lifestyles, a decolonised future and social change will also find this book useful.

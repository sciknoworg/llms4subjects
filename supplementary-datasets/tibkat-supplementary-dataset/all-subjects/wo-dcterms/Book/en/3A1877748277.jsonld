            "abstract": "In a global world, where the acceleration of technological changes is happening in all industrial sectors, a special focus is forced on innovation and creativity. The book has gathered a small number of sectors where innovation is being the main vector to achieve the competitiveness that companies are craving. The motivation to choose these sectors has been preceded by a careful selection in which we wanted to pick up those in which innovation is a key today. Different aspects push to create and innovate: the environment in general and in particular climate change is forcing to rethink sectors such as energy, infrastructure, water, biotechnology, materials, defense, education, or health. Dear reader, in your hand is a work that reflects the same spirit of the human being: curiosity and eagerness to overcome have allowed humanity to have evolved and still continue today",

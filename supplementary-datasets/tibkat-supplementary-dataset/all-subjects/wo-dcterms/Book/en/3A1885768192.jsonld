            "abstract": "How Divine Images Became Art tells the story of the parallel \u2018discovery\u2019 of Russian medieval art and of the Italian \u2018primitives\u2019 at the beginning of the twentieth century. While these two developments are well-known, they are usually studied in isolation. Tarasov\u2019s study has the great merit of showing the connection between the art world in Russia and the West, and its impact in the cultural history of the continent in the pre-war period.   Drawing on a profound familiarity with Russian sources, some of which are little known to Western scholars, and on equally expert knowledge of Western material and scholarship, Oleg Tarasov presents a fresh perspective on early twentieth-century Russian and Western art. The author demonstrates that during the Belle \u00c9poque, the interest in medieval Russian icons and Italian \u2018primitives\u2019 lead to the recognition of both as distinctive art forms conveying a powerful spiritual message. Formalist art theory and its influence on art collecting played a major role in this recognition of aesthetic and moral value of \u2018primitive\u2019 paintings, and was instrumental in reshaping the perception of divine images as artworks.  Ultimately, this monograph represents a significant contribution to our understanding of early twentieth-century art; it will be of interest to art scholars, students and anyone interested in the spiritual and aesthetic revival of religious paintings in the Belle \u00c9poque",

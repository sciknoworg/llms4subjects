            "abstract": "The monograph focuses on the problems and prospects of development of the road transport complex on the basis of the integrated approach. In Ukraine, the road transport system is one of the priority ones. However, its priority status is reflected only in numerous regulations. In such conditions the necessity of realization of scientific achievements and practical recommendations of development of the road transport system as a whole is actualized. The integrated approach to financing, management, innovation, quality and security has been applied.  In order to eliminate the regional imbalance in the development of the state, as an urgent measure, methodological principles of support for weak regions have been substantiated and developed, which envisages its implementation in the short term. It is proposed to determine the rating of the best educational institutions in the region on the basis of mathematical modeling. Relevant clusters of educational institutions of the region have been established and systematized, taking into account their sectoral significance, form of ownership, efficiency of state funding and the amount of own revenues. Methodological support for quality management of transport and logistics services has been developed, which includes a certain procedure and a set of appropriate methods for implementing this activity based on the application of the scenario approach and algorithmization of procedures for obtaining possible states of operation of modern transport and logistics sector objects. A set of functional subsystems of an enterprise by analogy with the systems of a living organism, the activity of which is interdependent, which ensures the stability of the \u00abliving organism\u00bb of the enterprise to the influence of external conditions has been formed. The process of determining and assessing the competencies of employees on the basis of the modern assessment technology \u00abAssessment Center\u00bb has been formed. The program of development of corporate social responsibility at internal and external levels of implementation taking into account features of various groups of stakeholders is offered. The combined safety management system \u00abbehavior + transport status + infrastructure + permanent monitoring + post-accident services\u00bb is offered.  The proposed theoretical, methodological and applied aspects of the development of the road transport system are of theoretical and practical interest to scientists, entrepreneurs and government agencies",

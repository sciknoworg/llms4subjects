            "abstract": "Susanna Moodie is, of course, best known for her books <i>Roughing It in the Bush</i> and <i>Life in the Clearings</i>, which are largely comprised of short sketches that she had previously published. What is not widely known, however, is that Moodie had a long and prolific literary career in which short sketches and tales were among her favoured genres. This book offers a selection of these narratives, most of which have been unavailable in print since the 19th century. This collection will give the reader a new understanding of Susanna Moodie's work",

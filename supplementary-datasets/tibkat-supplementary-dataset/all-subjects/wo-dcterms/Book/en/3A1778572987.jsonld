            "abstract": "This book can serve as a reference resource for those very same design and control engineers who help connect their everyday experience in design with the control field of mechatronics. This book also consists of basic and main mechatronic system's laboratory applications for use in research and development departments in academia, government, and industry, and it can be used as a reference source in university libraries. It can also be used as a resource for scholars interested in understanding and explaining the engineering design and control process and for engineering students studying within the traditional structure of most engineering departments and colleges. It is evident that there is an expansion of mechatronics laboratories and classes in the university environment worldwide",

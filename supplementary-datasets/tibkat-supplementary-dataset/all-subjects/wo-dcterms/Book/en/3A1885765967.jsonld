            "abstract": "The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has prompted the exploration of its potential applications in the construction industry, although at a slower rate. Since the starting point of a design is the analysis of the site\u2019s constraints, the purpose of the ongoing research is the application of artificial intelligence in risk assessment for site areas. The primary objective of this research project is to develop an interactive map that employs AI to identify potential surface and aerial interferences. This map aims to support planners, engineers, and architects during the site context analysis phase by providing real-time visualization of obstacles. The interactive map allows users to explore and analyze identified obstacles, enabling cluster markers and filtering of features. The results obtained from applying this approach in Milan, Italy, demonstrate its functionality and usability, highlighting the tool's ability to provide valuable information in both localized and citywide scenarios. Potential improvements such as size assessment and advanced marker generation are also being examined to enhance the management of surface and air interferences. The goal is to enhance the tool's functionality, accuracy, and planning efficiency in construction projects",

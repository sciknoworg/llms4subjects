We think epic in the sense of bpNichol writing Martyrology, Jab\u00e8s with his books of books, Rosmarie Waldrop\u2019s Curves to the Apple, Keith Waldrop\u2019s Transcendental Studies, Harryette Mullen\u2019s Recyclopedia, Craig Santos Perez\u2019s from unincorporated territory, Nathaniel Mackey\u2019s long song(s), & others. We think epic with these ongoing & collected meta-serial works rather than the traditional notion of the epic as heroic nation building story, though we borrow epic tropes from Dante\u2019s supernal underworld forest (& infernal forested underworld), sing with Sappho\u2019s lyre, are haunted by the spirit of Homer\u2019s katabasis, & are formed by the Popol Vuh\u2019s wordly cosmos, which influenced us before we read it.Y the monster is alone in the woods, enclosed by a highway : a preserve. The woods are made of paper; the paper forest burns & burns. Woods & monster are endangered, pressed into service, a hazard. So is the book pressed into service, danger & endangered. The forest is deforested & reforested, dance of shadow & flame, a fantasia of ecological return, the forest (enchanted) by itself. The haunted woods. The ghosts the ghosts of what. This is the world without us. & we are here as well. Here in the forest of language",

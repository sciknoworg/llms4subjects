            "abstract": "The war in Ukraine has highlighted Europe\u2019s urgency to diversify its energy supplies and reduce dependence on Russia. While, in such context, energy security has become a top political priority for Europe, energy resources from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have drawn European countries\u2019 renewed attention. Boasting abundant oil and gas reserves, the MENA region will likely play a leading role in Europe\u2019s current energy crisis. While MENA exporters\u2019 ability to increase their supply is limited in the short-term, more resources are likely to be available in a longer-term perspective. As Europeans are scrambling for alternatives, this Report analyses the different implications for a number of MENA exporters of fossil fuels. As these countries have become even more central to Europe\u2019s energy security, assessing their prospects is of paramount importance, including not only their short-term role as suppliers of fossil fuels, but also their opportunity to accelerate along the path of the green transition. How is the current energy crisis affecting the role of MENA hydrocarbons producers as Europe\u2019s energy suppliers? How will Europe\u2019s needs in additional resources redefine energy geopolitics in the Middle East and North Africa? Which new prospects for their green transition?",

The ship was carrying a large consignment of chemicals and diverse hazardous materials that caused a disastrous and vast environmental and social catastrophe in the region. Through many case studies, accumulated knowledge, and experiences, the authors discuss the accident response, risk mitigation, investigation, and damage assessment activities from the very onset of the accident. It helps researchers and regulators understand the facts of this unique marine chemical accident and to formulate necessary future regulations as well as to develop robust safety and sustainability management systems and safety cultures\"--",

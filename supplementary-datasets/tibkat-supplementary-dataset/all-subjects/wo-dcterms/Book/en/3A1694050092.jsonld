                "Go from beginner to pro using one of the most effective and widely used technology stacks, Microsoft ASP.NET. Beginning with the basics, you will learn how to create interactive, professional-grade, database-driven web applications in no time, using ASP.NET, C#, SQL, Ajax, and JavaScript. Essential ASP.NET Web Forms Development is divided into six learning modules and will take you from soup to nuts with ASP.NET. Part I is an introduction to the major concepts, methodologies, and technologies associated with .NET web application development. You will learn about the client-server model, the .NET Framework, the ASP.NET and C# programming languages, and the Visual Studio integrated development environment. Part II teaches you how to develop a single-page .NET web application and add server and data validation controls, laying the foundation for learning languages in the context of an ASP.NET web application. Part III is all about C# operations and shows you how to perform assignment operations, conversion operations, control operations, string operations, arithmetic operations, date and time operations, array operations, collection operations, and file system operations, as well as how to create custom C# classes in the context of a .NET web application. In Part IV, you dive into a multiple-page .NET web application and learn how to maintain state between pages and create master pages, themes, and navigation controls. Part V shows you how to connect a .NET web application to a SQL Server database. You will learn to read a database schema, program in the SQL language, utilize data binding, perform single- and multiple-row database table maintenance, and write code behind database operations. And finally, Part VI teaches you how to enhance the interactivity of a .NET web application. You will learn how to generate email messages, make use of basic Ajax controls and the Ajax Control Toolkit, and program in the JavaScript language. What You Will Learn Delve into the basics of the client-server model, the .NET Framework, the ASP.NET and C# programming languages, and the Visual Studio integrated development environment Create a page and add server and data validation controls Develop basic programming skills in the C# language Maintain state between pages and create master pages, themes, and navigation controls Read a database schema, program in the SQL language, utilize data binding, perform single- and multiple-row database table maintenance, and write code behind database operations Generate email messages, make use of basic Ajax controls and the Ajax Control Toolkit, and program in the JavaScript language This book is for anyone who wants to learn how to build ASP.NET web applications. Basic computer skills and the use of a database management system are recommended. Robert E. Beasley is Professor of Computing at Franklin College where he teaches software engineering courses. He received his BS and MS degrees from Illinois State University and his PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has been an active software consultant in the public and private sectors since 1987 and has been teaching since 1995. He is the author of three books and more than 50 articles and has spoken at numerous global conferences."

                "This book presents select proceedings of the International Conference on Cement and Building Koncrete infrastructure for sustainability and Resilience (CBKR-2023). It discusses the latest technologies and innovative and non-conventional materials for sustainable built environment. The topics covered include alternate, sustainable, cost-effective, and smart materials and technologies. It also covers applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in construction, MCDM techniques, performance-based design, and 3D printing technologies. The book is useful for researchers and professionals in the area of civil engineering and materials science.",

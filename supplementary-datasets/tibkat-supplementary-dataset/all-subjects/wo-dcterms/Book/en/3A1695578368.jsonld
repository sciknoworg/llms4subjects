            "abstract": "\"Ever since the discovery of graphene, two-dimensional layered materials (2DLMs) have been the central tool of the materials research community. The reason behind their importance is their superlative and unique electronic, optical, physical, chemical and mechanical properties in layered form rather than in bulk form. The 2DLMs have been applied to electronics, catalysis, energy, environment, and biomedical applications. The following topics are discussed in the book's fifteen chapters : The research status of the 2D metal-organic frameworks and the different techniques used to synthesize them.  2D black phosphorus (BP) and its practical application in various fields.  Reviews the synthesis methods of MXenes and provides a detailed discussion of their structural characterization and physical, electrochemical and optical properties, as well as applications in catalysis, energy storage, environmental management, biomedicine, and gas sensing. The carbon-based materials and their potential applications via the photocatalytic process using visible light irradiation.  2D materials like graphene, TMDCs, few-layer phosphorene, MXene in layered form and their heterostructures.\"--",

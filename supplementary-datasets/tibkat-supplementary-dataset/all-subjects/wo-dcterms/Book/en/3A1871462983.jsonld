                "\u201c[\u2026]essential reading for anyone who believes in the importance of investigative journalism in holding the powerful to account.\u201d \u2014Richard Sambrook, Emeritus Professor, Cardiff University, UK and Co-Chair of The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, UK \u201cA fantastic, timely and comprehensive look at the current state and challenges of investigative journalism.\u201d \u2014Henrik \u00d6rnebring, Professor of Media and Communication, Karlstad University, Sweden and winner of the 2023 AEJMC James A. Tankard Book Award This open access book is a rare example of the ethnographic study of investigative journalism. This book explores entrepreneurial attempts to combine traditional investigative journalism with alternative ways of organising this work. It transcends watershed investigative projects in favour of the ways in which new actors (citizens, technologists, bloggers and local reporters, among others) join experienced investigative journalists in experiments with the practices of watchdog journalism in the digital era. Cases include Bristol Cable, Bureau Local and the Korea Center for Investigative Journalism, as well as Forbidden Stories. The book also includes two chapters on the impact of COVID-19 upon the development of cross-disciplinary work in a traditional newsroom and in the larger media ecosystems of both Norway and China. This is a timely book for journalism students, scholars and investigative reporters, who share a passion for this form of journalism. Maria Konow-Lund is a professor at Oslo Metropolitan University. She was Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie fellow at Cardiff University (2017-2019). Her recent work focuses on investigative journalism, terror coverage, practice during COVID-19, and changing roles. Michelle Park and was recently awarded her PhD degree by the School of Journalism, Media and Culture at Cardiff University, UK, after working as a newspaper reporter in the USA. Saba Bebawi is Head of the Journalism and Writing discipline in the School of Communication at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). ."

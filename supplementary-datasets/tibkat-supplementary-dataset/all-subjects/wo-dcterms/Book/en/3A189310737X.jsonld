            "abstract": [
                "This open access book aims to show how creative ruptions \u2013 disturbances or commotions - can lead to the emergence of ethical, care-ful educational futures. Grounded in empirical and theoretical research undertaken from posthuman, decolonial, new materialist and feminist perspectives, this edited volume questions historical and current assumptions as to how education is structured and enacted, and provides examples and tools illustrating how to create and work with creative ruptions. Under the guidance of an experienced editorial team, the authors demonstrate how creative ruptions can respond to various wicked problems through the design and enactment of transformative pedagogies and accompanying research. Including consideration of how we can grow our emotional repertoires from anxiety to include hope and courage, the book explores how creativity might expand the horizons of personal, social and political possibility that take shape within \u2013 and ultimately determine \u2013 education and its futures. Offering theoretically driven and practically grounded transdisciplinary examples of alternative educational futures, this volume is an ideal reading for those interested in the intersecting fields of Possibilities Studies in Education, Creativity in Education, Educational Futures, Pedagogy, and related disciplines. Kerry Chappell is an Associate Professor in the School of Education at the University of Exeter, UK, where she leads the Creativity and Emergent Educational futures Network and the MA Education Creative Arts Programme. She is also Adjunct Associate Professor at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. Her research focuses on creativity in education, specifically in the arts (dance) and transdisciplinary settings, and how creativity contributes ethically to educational futures. Chris Turner is an independent writer and researcher, and an Honorary Lecturer at the University of Exeter, UK. An expert in the field of education, his research and writing interests are in the aesthetics and ecology of education, from which he has developed the theoretical concepts of aesthoecology. A member of the Creativity and Emergent Educational futures Network at the University of Exeter, he has lectured widely on educational leadership and community education. Heather Wren is a Graduate Research Assistant and PhD student at the University of Exeter, UK. Her research explores environmental empathy using a New Materialist lens in an effort to understand how this type of empathy emerges in education. She is also a member of the Creativity and Emergent Educational futures Network at the University of Exeter.",

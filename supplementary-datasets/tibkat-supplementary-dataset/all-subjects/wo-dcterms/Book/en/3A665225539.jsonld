            "abstract": "This book traces Danish-Greenlandic relations over 100 years and is the first publication to coverthe period 1900-2000. The main trend is the development from a colonial situation in 1900 with astate owned company runnig nearly all business to an open economy with steadily growing selfgovernmentfor Greenland short of full independence.The Danish policy can be described as benevolent, but financially the budget was tight until afterthe second World War, the philosophy being that Denmark should neither lose nor gain. After thewar there was heavy investment to bring Greenland nearer to standards of living comparable toDenmark and substantial subsidies were given make that happen.The Greenlanders attitude towards Denmark developed along lines familiar from other examplesof decolonisation. The first phase of accepting the coloniser was long over, now seeking equalitywith the coloniser was the main aim in their endeavours. From 1911 two provincial councils woicedspeaking the Greenlanders views and their political influence steadily grew. In 1953 Greenland gotrepresentation in the Danish parliament. The third phase of doing without the coloniser began in theearly 1970s when Greenlanders sought home rule status, obtained in 1979. In the following twentyyears the Home Rule Authority gradually took over nearly all lawmaking and administration andfrom 2004 a committee has explored ways of giving Greenland a more independent voice in foreignaffairs. In 2003 the ultimate goal was declared to be full independence",

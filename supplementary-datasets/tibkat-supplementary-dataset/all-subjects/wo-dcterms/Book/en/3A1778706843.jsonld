            "abstract": "Surgery continues to be the mainstay treatment for melanoma localized to the primary tumor and/or lymph nodes. Results from randomized controlled trials indicate that sentinel node biopsy for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma of intermediate thickness has a beneficial effect on recurrence rates, and adjuvant radiotherapy to regional lymph node fields following surgical resection reduces loco-regional recurrence in patients at high risk of relapse. Isolated limb perfusion, electrochemotherapy, and photodynamic therapy continue to be evaluated for treatment of stage IV disease. However, the greatest excitement in new treatment has been with targeted therapies for genetic mutations. In particular, the promising results of partial and complete tumor response in stage IV disease from early phase trials of the B-RAF kinase inhibitors. This book provides a contemporary insight into the therapeutic treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma and is relevant to clinicians and researchers worldwide. In addition, an update on current clinical trials for melanoma treatment has been included, and two chapters have been reserved to discuss the treatment of oral and uveal melanoma",

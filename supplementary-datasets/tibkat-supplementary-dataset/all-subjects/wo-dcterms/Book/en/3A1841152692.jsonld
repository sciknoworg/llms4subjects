            "abstract": "The \u015ar\u012b\u1e0d\u0101k\u0101r\u1e47avamah\u0101yogin\u012btantrar\u0101ja (abbreviated to \u1e0c\u0101k\u0101r\u1e47ava, \u201cOcean of \u1e0c\u0101kas or Heroes\u201d) is one of the last scriptures belonging to the Buddhist Sa\u1e43vara tradition in South Asia. It was composed in the eastern area of the Indian subcontinent sometime between the late 10th and 12th centuries, and its extant version was most likely compiled around the early 12th century. Chapter 15 of the \u1e0c\u0101k\u0101r\u1e47ava, (hereafter \u1e0c\u0101k\u0101r\u1e47ava 15) teaches a large-scale and elaborate ma\u1e47\u1e0dala of the highest god Heruka that comprises 986 major deities. This monograph presents the first critical edition and English translation (with annotation) of the Sanskrit text of the \u1e0c\u0101k\u0101r\u1e47ava 15, elucidates its form and meanings, and clarifies its significance in the history of Buddhism in South Asia. I also provide the first critical edition and English translation (with annotation) of Jayasena's Ratnapadmar\u0101ganidhi (\"Precious Ruby Treasury,\" composed in the 12th century), which is the oldest manual for visualizing the Heruka ma\u1e47\u1e0dala of the \u1e0c\u0101k\u0101r\u1e47ava 15. In the last stage of the history of Tantric Buddhism in India, when various Buddhist Tantric traditions were already present, some texts were composed, such as the K\u0101lacakratantra and the Vajr\u0101val\u012b of Abhay\u0101karagupta. These texts provide inclusive Tantric systems in which various preceding traditions are integrated and reorganized. The \u1e0c\u0101k\u0101r\u1e47ava is one such text. The Heruka ma\u1e47\u1e0dala in the \u1e0c\u0101k\u0101r\u1e47ava 15 is comprehensive and integrates deities from various Tantric traditions and components of the Buddhist cosmos within the framework of the Sa\u1e43vara system",

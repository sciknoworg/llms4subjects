            "abstract": "Sudan's medium-term national development policy framework is embodied in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP). The paper was formulated in 2012 in the context of immense political upheaval due to the separation of the North (now Sudan) and South Sudan in 2011, which resulted in substantial loss (about 75 percent) in oil revenue and Sudan's total revenue. To this end, Sudan launched a Five-Year Development Plan (2012-2016) to serve as a growth-oriented strategy with a primary focus on sustainable development and poverty reduction in the medium term. The IPRSP aims to reduce poverty through rapid, sustainable, and shared economic growth. Developing human resources is one of the four broad pillars of the IPRSP, which recognizes the role of investment in human development to build and enhance the population capabilities through education and better health. The Government of Sudan is now preparing the full PRSP that outlines a medium- to long-term plan for poverty reduction. This aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the World Bank Group's twin goals to eliminate extreme poverty (with US1.90 dollars per day as the poverty line) and boost shared prosperity by 2030. The paper proceeds as follows. Section two presents the results of selected education outcomes, linking them with poverty. Section three focuses on the link between health outcomes and poverty in Sudan. Section four provides a summary of the main findings and policy options",

            "abstract": "The monograph provides an overview of equipment for processing and processing technology of melons. Until recent years, the primary processing of melons has no industrial production in the CIS countries and abroad. The all-round reduction or complete elimination of the share of manual labor due to the comprehensive mechanization of technological processes is acquiring particular relevance. However, when processing such crops as melons, it is impossible to completely exclude manual labor at the current level of development of agricultural and processing equipment. This is due to the specific properties of not only the plants themselves, but also the fruits. So the tech- nologies for harvesting and processing melons include operations traditionally performed in whole or in part by hand. The mechanical and technological foundations for the calculation and design of machines for processing the fruits of melons for technical and food purposes are stated. The theoretical prerequisites for the creation of products based on melon are presented, the issues of rational use of melons for the production of long-term storage products are highlighted. Basic physical, mechanical and rheological properties of pumpkin, melon and watermelon fruits are given. Criteria equations for the processes of grinding in a closed environment, cutting, mixing are given. The proposed options for equipment and technological lines for the processing of fruits of water- melon, melon, pumpkin are presented. The technologies for processing the fruits of watermelon, pumpkin melon are described",

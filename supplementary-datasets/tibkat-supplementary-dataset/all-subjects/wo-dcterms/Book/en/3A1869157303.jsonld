            "abstract": "This volume critically discusses the role empathy plays in different processes of understanding. More precisely, it clarifies empathy\u2019s role in interpersonal understanding and appreciating works of literature and art. The volume also includes a section on historical theories of empathy\u2019s role in understanding.  When it comes to understanding other persons, empathy is typically seen as a process that enables the empathizer to recognize a target person\u2019s mental states, a process which is in turn seen as \u201cunderstanding\u201d this person. This volume, however, explores empathy\u2019s role in understanding beyond mere mental state recognition. With contributions on processes of interpersonal understanding and understanding of literature and art, it provides readers with an overview over both differences and similarities regarding empathy\u2019s epistemic role in two rather different areas. Since important roots of the debate about empathic understanding lie at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, the historical section of the volume focusses specifically on this period.  Empathy\u2019s Role in Understanding Persons, Literature, and Art will appeal to scholars and advanced students working in the philosophy of mind, epistemology, aesthetics and the history of philosophy, as well as in literary studies and art history",

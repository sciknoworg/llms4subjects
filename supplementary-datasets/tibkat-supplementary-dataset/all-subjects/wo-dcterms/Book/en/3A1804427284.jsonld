                "The book covers the classical areas of technical thermodynamics: The first part deals with the basic equations for energy conversion and idealized fluids. The second part deals with real fluids, which can be subject to a phase change, for example. Furthermore, thermodynamic mixtures of fluids are considered, e.g., humid air and gas mixtures. In the last part of the book, combustion processes and chemical reactions are presented and thermodynamically balanced. In each chapter, there are examples and exercises to deepen the theoretical knowledge. Compared to the first edition, the topic of thermodynamic state diagrams has been greatly revised. State diagrams of relevant refrigerants have been added as well as a formulary. The section on chemically reacting systems has been expanded and thoroughly revised. In the basic chapters, tasks and examples have been added to consolidate the understanding of the subject. The book is aimed at students of mechanical engineering and professional engineers.",

            "abstract": "\"The object of this text is to provide an elementary and reasonably self-contained overview of reliability engineering that is suitable for an upper level undergraduate or first year graduate course for students of any engineering discipline. In addition, the third edition has added material for the \"beginning\" Reliability Engineer who is in the field and transferred to the Reliability/Safety discipline. The materials reflect the inherently interdisciplinary character of reliability considerations and the central role played by probability and statistical analysis in presenting reliability principles and practices. The examples and exercises are drawn from a variety of engineering and some non-engineering fields. They can be understood, however, with only the knowledge from the physics, chemistry, and basic engineering courses contained in the first years of nearly all engineering curricula. Likewise, the reader is presumed to have completed only the standard mathematics sequence, through ordinary differential equations, required of most engineering students. No prior knowledge of probability or statistics is assumed; the development of the required concepts is contained within the text. For each appropriate example in this edition, the necessary steps for obtaining a solution are indicated using readily available software. EXCEL is augmented in many cases with the MINITAB\u00ae+. These two programs were chosen because they are widely available, and instructions for their use are also widely available. There are other Statistical software packages other than MINITAB that can do most of the analyses (SAS, SAS/JMP, RELIASOFT++, SUPERSMITH, and others) that are referenced in the 3rd edition. The problems and solutions are amenable to all these software packages as well as others\"--",

            "abstract": "The introduction of village courts in Papua New Guinea in 1975                    was an ambitious experiment in providing semi-formal legal access to the                    country's overwhelmingly rural population. Nearly 50 years later, the                    enthusiastic adoption of these courts has had a number of ramifications, some of                    them unanticipated. Arguably, the village courts have developed and are working                    exactly as they were supposed to do, adapted by local communities to modes and                    styles consistent with their own dispute management sensibilities. But with                    little in the way of state oversight or support, most village courts have                    become, of necessity, nearly autonomous. Village courts have also become the                    blueprint for other modes of dispute management. They overlap with other sources                    of authority, so the line between what does and does not constitute a                    'court\u2019 is now indistinct in many parts of the country. Rather than casting                    this issue as a problem for legal development, the contributors to Grassroots                    Law in Papua New Guineaask how, under conditions of state withdrawal, people                    seek to retain an understanding of law that holds out some promise of either                    keeping the attention of the state or reproducing the state\u2019s authority",

            "abstract": "\"Simulations play an increasingly important role not only in scientific research but also in engineering developments. Introduction to Simulations of Semiconductor Lasers introduces senior undergraduates to the design of semiconductor lasers and their simulations. The book begins with explaining the physics and fundamental characteristics behind semiconductor lasers and their applications. It presumes little prior knowledge, such that only a familiarity with the basics of electromagnetism and quantum mechanics is required. The book transitions from textbook explanations, equations, and formulas to ready-to-run numeric codes that enable the visualization of concepts and simulation studies. Multiple chapters are supported by Matlab code which can be accessed by the students. These are ready-to-run, but they can be modified to simulate other structures if desired. Providing a unified treatment of the fundamental principles and physics of semiconductors and semiconductor lasers, Introduction to Simulations of Semiconductor Lasers is an accessible, practical guide for advanced undergraduate students of Physics, particularly for courses in laser physics. Marek S. Wartak is a Professor in the Department of Physics and Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario. He has over 30 years of experience in semiconductor physics, photonics and optoelectronics, analytical methods, modelling and computer-aided design tools\"--",

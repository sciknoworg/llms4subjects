            "abstract": "To the classical driving forces of migration such as poverty, oppression and war, yet another is being added: globalization. The trend toward globalization has created new opportunities for trade and investment. These have had positive implications for economic growth and living standards. However, they also confront developed and less developed countries (LCDs) with difficult policy choices. Developed Countries (DCs) have to find a compromise between competitiveness and high labour costs, and between trade liberalization and immigration controls. LCDs have to decide whether to export labour or goods, and to accept foreign resources for development rather than migration. While, in the literature, the impact of globalization has been largely studied from specialist perspectives, this volume offers a comprehensive view of the issue. In Globalization of Labour Markets: Challenges, Adjustment and Policy Response in the European Union and Less Developed Countries international experts: Explain the welfare implications of export of goods and labour from LCDs to the DCs from the perspective of both international and labour economics; Shed light on the possible relationship between foreign direct investment and migration; Offer a better understanding of the experiences of Asian, Latin American and African countries with exporting goods or labour; and Discuss the different policy responses to the globalization of labour markets in the European Union, East and South-East Asia and Latin America, while being aware of inter-country variations within these regions",

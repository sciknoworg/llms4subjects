                "Among all nonthermal food processing technologies, high intensity pulsed electric fields (PEF) is one of the most appealing due to its short treatment times and reduced heating effects. Its capability to enhance extraction processes and to inactivate microorganisms at temperatures that do not cause any deleterious effect on flavor, color or nutrient value of foods opens interesting possibilities for the food processing industry. This new and revised edition of Pulsed Electric Fields Technology for the Food Industry presents the information accumulated on PEF over the last decade by experienced microbiologists, biochemists, food technologists and electrical and food engineers. With insight into current applications of PEF across the food industry, this text offers a comprehensive and up to date resource on PEF application in the food industry from the scientific fundamentals to its use in various food types to environmental and regulatory aspects. For researchers and industry professionals seeking a single source containing all of the relevant and up to date information on PEF in foods, look no further than this essential text.",

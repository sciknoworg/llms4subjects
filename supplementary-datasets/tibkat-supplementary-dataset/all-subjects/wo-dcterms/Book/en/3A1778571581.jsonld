            "abstract": "Fractal analysis has entered a new era. The applications to different areas of knowledge have been surprising. Benoit Mandelbrot, creator of fractal geometry, would have been surprised by the use of fractal analysis presented in this book. Here we present the use of fractal geometry, in particular, fractal analysis in two sciences: health sciences and social sciences and humanities. Part 1 is Health Science. In it, we present the latest advances in cardiovascular signs, kidney images to determine cancer growth, EEG signals, magnetoencephalography signals, and photosensitive epilepsy. We show how it is possible to produce ultrasonic lenses or even sound focusing. In Part 2, we present the use of fractal analysis in social sciences and humanities. It includes anthropology, hierarchical scaling, human settlements, language, fractal dimension of different cultures, cultural traits, and Mesoamerican complexity. And in Part 3, we present a few useful tools for fractal analysis, such as graphs and correlation, self-affine and self-similar graphs, and correlation function. It is impossible to picture today's research without fractal geometry",

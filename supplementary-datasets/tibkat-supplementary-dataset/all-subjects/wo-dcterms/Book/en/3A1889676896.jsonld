                "This book provides selected contributions of the 3rd International Conference on Advanced Joining Processes, held in Braga, Portugal, on October 19\u201320, 2023. The volume is dedicated to the current developments in mechanical joining (1st Section), joining by plastic deformation (2nd Section), and welding (3rd Section). The selected contributions represent the state of the art in advanced methods of joining. The book serves as a reference volume for researchers and graduate students working with advanced joining processes.",

            "abstract": "\"With thirty-nine original chapters from internationally prominent scholars, The Virginia Woolf Handbook is designed for post-secondary students, scholars, and common readers. Feminist to the core, each chapter of this volume examines an aspect of Woolf's achievement and legacy. Each chapter offers an overview that is at once fresh and thoroughly grounded in prior scholarship. Six sections focus on Woolf's life, her texts, her experiments, her as a professional, her contexts, and her afterlife. Opening chapters on Woolf's life address the powerful influences of family, friends, and home. The section on her works moves chronologically, emphasizing Woolf's practice of writing essays and reviews alongside her fiction. Chapters on Woolf's experimentalism pay special attention to the literariness of Woolf's writing, with opportunity to trace its distinctive watermark while \"Professions of Writing,\" invites readers to consider how Woolf worked in cultural fields including and extending beyond the Hogarth Press and the TLS. The \"Contexts\" section moves beyond writing to depict her engagement with the natural world as well as the political, artistic, and popular culture of her time. The final section, \"Afterlives,\" demonstrates the many ways Woolf's reputation continues to grow, across the globe, and across media, in ideas and in artistic expression. Of particular note, chapters explore three distinct Woolfian traditions in fiction: the novel of manners, magical realism, and the feminist novel. Many chapters in the early sections chime with those in \"Afterlives\": for example, readers can explore Woolf's involvement with the suffrage movement in her time and her ongoing influence in feminist theory today\"--",

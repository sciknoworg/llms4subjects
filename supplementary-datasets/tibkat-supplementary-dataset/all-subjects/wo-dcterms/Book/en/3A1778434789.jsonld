            "title": "Many Body Quantum Chaos",
            "abstract": "The field of chaos in many-body quantum systems has a long history, going back to Wigner\u2019s simple models for heavy nuclei. Quantum chaos is being investigated in a broad variety of experimental platforms such as heavy nuclei, driven (few-electron) atoms, ultracold quantum gases, and photonic or microwave realizations. Quantum chaos plays a new and important role in many branches of physics, from condensed matter problems of many-body localization, including thermalization studies in closed and open quantum systems, and the question of dynamical stability relevant for quantum information and quantum simulation. This Special Issue and its related book address theories and experiments, methods from classical chaos, semiclassics, and random matrix theory, as well as many-body condensed matter physics. It is dedicated to Prof. Shmuel Fishman, who was one of the major representatives of the field over almost four decades, who passed away in 2019",

Advanced characterization methods, techniques, and new instruments are emphasized. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: \u00b7 Extraction and processing of various types of minerals, process-structure-property relationship of metal alloys, glasses, ceramics, polymers, composites, semiconductors, and carbon using as functional and structural materials. \u00b7 Novel methods and techniques for characterizing materials across a spectrum of systems and processes. \u00b7 Characterization of mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical, dielectric, magnetic, physical, and other properties of materials. \u00b7 Characterization of structural, morphological, and topographical natures of materials at micro- and nano- scales. \u00b7 Characterization of extraction and processing including process development and analysis. \u00b7 Advances in instrument developments for microstructure analysis and performance evaluation of materials, such as computer tomography (CT), X-ray and neutron diffraction, electron microscopy (SEM, FIB, TEM), and spectroscopy (EDS, WDS, EBSD) techniques. \u00b7 2D and 3D modelling for materials characterization.",

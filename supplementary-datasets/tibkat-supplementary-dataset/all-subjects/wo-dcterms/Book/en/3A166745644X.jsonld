                "Regarding the vast use of chemical components in different human activities, they are susceptible to corrosion because of contact with aggressive environments. Therefore, the use of inhibitors for the control of corrosion of chemical components in corrosive media is an urgent affair. Numerous investigations were carried out and are still being done to study the corrosion inhibition potential of organic compounds. Remarkable inhibition efficiency was achieved by all these compounds particularly some with N, S, and O atoms in their structure. Unfortunately, most of these compounds are not only expensive but also toxic to living beings. Hence, it is essential to mention the importance of natural inhibitors as eco-friendly, readily available, and renewable sources. The main goal of this book is to point out the influence of these components in terms of physical and, in some cases, chemical, processes on different components in aggressive media. Different methods of measuring corrosion, adsorption behavior, mechanism of inhibitors, and some related information is presented in this book. There is a lack of comprehensive and relevant books on this subject, so we decided to write this book in order to accumulate useful information about the influence of natural inhibitors on metals in corrosive areas and to make it accessible to researchers",

            "abstract": "\"With the ever-increasing demand for energy worldwide, nations are looking for suitable options to solve the energy crisis, a matter of serious global concern. Many nations around the world are investing huge capital in the quest for sustainable energy sources. Fossil fuels are very limited, and their utilization comes with a number of harmful effects on human health and environment. This book addresses the energy challenge by discussing the various aspects of design, exploitation, and applications of green nanomaterials in energy devices-for energy efficiency, energy conversion, energy storage, and energy saving. The book also addresses the limitations that currently exist and how green nanomaterials can be the utilized as a future prospect towards a sustainable economy. The book emphasizes the importance and different modes of synthesis of nanomaterials, with detailed emphasis on green nanomaterials. Energy efficiency and environmental impact of the utilization of green nanomaterials as energy conversion devices are a major focus of the book. Key features: Addresses the global energy crisis and presents a picture of depleting resources Highlights the importance of nanomaterials and efficient utilization Explains green synthesis of nanomaterials Discusses the utilization of green nanomaterials for energy conversion Looks at green nanomaterials towards a sustainable economy Discusses the existing challenges and limitations, with prospects of using green nanomaterials in energy conversion devices This volume will be a boon for engineers (mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc.), nanotechnologists, biologists, economists, researchers, scientists, and others who are called to address solutions to the energy crises with green nanomaterials\"--",

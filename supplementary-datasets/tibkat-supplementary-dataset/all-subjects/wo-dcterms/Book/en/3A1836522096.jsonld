            "abstract": "Broken Theory is a jettisoned collection of fragmentary writing, collected and collaged by new media artist, writer, musician, and theorist Alan Sondheim. Folding theoretical musings, text experiments, and personal confessions into a single textual flow, it examines the somatic foundations of philosophical theory and theorizing, discussing their relationships to the writer and body, and to the phenomenology of failure and fragility of philosophy\u2019s production. Writing remains writing, undercuts and corrects itself, is always superseded, always produced within an untoward and bespoke silo \u2013 not as an inconceivable last word, but instead a broken contribution to philosophical thinking. The book is based on fragmentation and collapse, displacing annihilation and wandering towards a form of \u201croiling\u201d within which the text teeters on the verge of disintegration. In other words, the writing develops momentary scaffoldings \u2013 writing shored up by the very mechanisms that threaten its disappearance.  Broken Theory is prefaced by a text from Maria Damon and followed by an extensive interview with art historian Ryan Whyte",

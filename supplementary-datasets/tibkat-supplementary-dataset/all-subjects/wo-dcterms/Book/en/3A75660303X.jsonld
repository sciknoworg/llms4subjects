Basic concepts are introduced using a step-by-step approach featuring a variety of practical electrical engineering-related examples and illustrated with MATLAB codes that the reader can use and adapt. Topics covered include classical optimization methods, one dimensional optimization, unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization, global optimization, space mapping optimization, and adjoint variable methods. Basic concepts are introduced using a step-by-step approach; features a variety of practical electrical engineering-related examples; illustrated with MATLAB\u00ae codes that the reader can use and adapt; topics covered include: classical optimization methods, one dimensional optimization, unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization, global optimization, space mapping optimization and adjoint variable methods.It will be essential reading for advanced students in electrical engineering and will also interest electrical engineering professionals.--",

                "This book focuses on southern Africa by engaging with \u2018norms\u2019 from various perspectives and how they have proliferated within a neo-liberalising context since the 1990s. It particularly examines gender norms in relation to agency, influence and their impact. Despite growing transnational activities, regional studies analyses have so far maintained a primarily linear logic not incorporative of the increasing interface between state and non-state regionalism in a transnational context since the advent of liberalisation and democratisation. Increasing non-state activities, and their connection to state processes involved in norm creation, adaptation, diffusion and implementation around broad questions of security (including gender security), amount to regional thickening. The book\u2019s analytical approach is informed by alternatives to mainstream approaches, emphasising processes rather than linearity inherent in regional international relations studies. The research reveals that transnational activities and regionalisation of gender and women-focused civil society actors are critical for advocacy and diverse representation within intergovernmental policymaking structures at the regional scale. Cecilia Nedziwe is Senior Lecturer in the Department of Political and International Studies at Rhodes University, Makhanda, South Africa. Her research interests centre around international and regional organisations, and on issues of gender, civil society and peacebuilding. Oluwaseun Tella is Head of the Future of Diplomacy at the University of Johannesburg\u2019s Institute for the Future of Knowledge, South Africa. He holds a doctorate in Political Science. His research interests include soft power, foreign policy, Nigeria\u2013South Africa relations, peace and conflict studies, comparative politics, African politics and global politics."

            "abstract": "What relations (of difference) between students develop in such practices of \u2018Planarbeit\u2019 in individualized secondary school teaching in which students relate to instructional tasks and to each other? In this study, a (video-)ethnographic approach is chosen to explore the contribution of students to the formation of social order in the classroom. The findings show that the \u2018Selbstst\u00e4ndigkeit\u2019 (independence) of students in individualized plan-teaching, which relies on students not only showing themselves responsible for their own progression, but also as \u2018mit-zust\u00e4ndig\u2019 (co-responsible) for the progression of the work processes of their classmates, is relational: The continuation, the resuming and the appropriateness of individual progressions is socially accounted for and practiced in task-related references between students \u2013 which is associated not only with specific practices, but also with relations of difference between those involved",

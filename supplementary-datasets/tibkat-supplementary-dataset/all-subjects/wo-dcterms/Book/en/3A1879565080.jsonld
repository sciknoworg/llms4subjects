            "abstract": "\"The dynamic mechanism of plate tectonics remains a reasonable theory, but one with shortcomings such as insufficient bases for plate division, unclear plate boundaries, and unclear geological characteristics. This book proposes that the world's continents should not be divided by plates, and that their formation is not due to plate tectonics but rather due to global crustal uplift evolution and sea-land evolution. This proposal is based on the authors' broad theoretical foundation and comprehensive professional knowledge, built up over more than ten years of in-depth research by many scholars on the evolution of the Earth's continents. In this book, many case studies are better explained by global crustal uplift and sea-land evolution. Namely, that the entire continents of the world are indivisible, and the changes of each land block over geological periods resulted from the sea-land changes. The book further develops the original \"geomechanics theory\" created by the famous geologist Li Siguang. As a vibrant and highly rigorous work, Prof Li's book offered important theoretical guidance that enriched the global geological community and led to a re-development within geological science. The strong response highlights the significance of geomechanics theory and our theories that build upon it in this book\"",

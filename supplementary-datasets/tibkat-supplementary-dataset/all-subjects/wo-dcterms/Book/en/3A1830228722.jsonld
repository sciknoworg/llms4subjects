            "abstract": [
                "This book focuses on Political Public Relations (PPR) Techniques of both Russian and US Leaderships. It does so by analysing leadership (presidential or otherwise) inaugural addresses from the two countries between 1980 to 2018, using triangulation analysis of verbal, non-verbal language, and emotions of speakers. Given that the Russian perception of Political Public Relations, known as Political Technologies (PT) in Russia, is unique and often misunderstood or misinterpreted in Western scholarship, the book acts as a bridge between these two fields of studies. With that in mind, the study of Political Technologies is explained and applied in a wider sense than is offered by other disciplines, specifically in more meaningful ways than suggested in communications discipline in the West. In doing so, the book not only offers a deep dive into theory, but also provides a unique methodology aiming at extracting and analysing PPR or PT techniques. This triangulation method allows us to investigate a combined effect of audio visual and verbal \u201ceffects\u201d on the general public, and offers a way of interpreting such \u201ceffects\u201d. Readers would understand more about the research dynamic in PPR discipline, apply the triangulation methodology to expand this research, and more generally find out more about the evidence-based list of PPR techniques and their applications and interpretations. Dr Albina Gayoso is an expert in political PR and behavioural psychology. Her academic career started in Russia where she completed a Bachelors with Honours in International Relations. She has been actively involved in UN volunteering during her years as a student, and in 2014 she became a recipient of a University of Newcastle (Australia) International Postgraduate Research Scholarship and UON Research Scholarship. She then moved to Australia to pursue her PhD project in Political Communication, where her research explored the practice of Political Public Relations techniques and their components, with a particular focus on the use of verbal and nonverbal communication in inaugural addresses of Russian and U.S. presidents with a focus on the years from 1981 through to 2013. Currently, she is working as Senior Stakeholder Engagement Officer at NSW Government and teaching at UN research and training centre CIFAL Newcastle. .",

                "Introductory Statistics and Random Phenomena integrates traditional statistical data analysis with new computational experimentation capabilities and concepts of algorithmic complexity and chaotic behavior in nonlinear dynamic systems.  This was the first advanced text/reference to bring together such a comprehensive variety of tools for the study of random phenomena occurring in engineering and the natural, life, and social sciences. The crucial computer experiments are conducted using the readily available computer program Mathematica\u00ae Uncertain Virtual Worlds\u2122 software packages which optimize and facilitate the simulation environment.  Brief tutorials are included that explain how to use theMathematica\u00ae programs for effective simulation and computer experiments.  Large and original real-life data sets are introduced and analyzed as a model for independent study. This is an excellent classroom tool and self-study guide.  The material is presented in a clear and accessible style providing numerous exercises and bibliographical notes suggesting further reading. Topics and Features Comprehensive and integrated treatment of uncertainty arising in engineering and scientific phenomena - algorithmic complexity, statistical independence, and nonlinear chaotic behavior Extensive exercise sets, examples, and Mathematica\u00ae computer experiments that reinforce concepts and algorithmic methods Thorough presentation of methods of data compression and representation Algorithmic approach to model selection and design of experiments Large data sets and 13 Mathematica\u00ae-based Uncertain Virtual Worlds\u2122 programs and code This text is an excellent resource for all applied statisticians, engineers, and scientists who need to use modern statistical analysis methods to investigate and model their data.  The present, softcover reprint is designed to make this classic textbook available to a wider audience. Reviews Highly data-oriented, with an unusually large collection of real-life examples taken from industry and various scientific disciplines\u2026 The book departs from the standard fare, by [also] including detailed coverage of such contemporary topics as chaotic dynamical systems, the nature of randomness, computability and Kolmogorov complexity, encryption, ergodicity, entropy, and even fractals. -Short Book Reviews, International Statistical Institute I find [this book] to be an excellent textbook, and I strongly recommend it as an introductory technical stat ...",

                "This detailed volume describes the most recent methodology for buckwheat research. Buckwheat serves as a promising functional food source containing various phenolic compounds, such as rutin, quercetin, and C-glycosylflavones, which have a positive therapeutic or dietary effect for promoting human health. This book explores techniques for studying this pseudocereal, namely the two most widely cultivated species, F. esculentum (common buckwheat) and F. tataricum (Tartary buckwheat). Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step and readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Practical and comprehensible, Buckwheat: Methods and Protocols is an ideal guide for plant scientists working in this field.",

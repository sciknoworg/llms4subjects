These works address the emerging technology in signal processing and its new aspects, as well as the related applications. Recent developments in image/video-based deep learning technology have enabled new services in the field of multimedia and recognition technology. The applications vary and range from digital signal processing to image, video and multimedia signal processing, also including object classification, learning mechanism design and data security. Recent advances in numerical, theoretical and experimental methodologies are presented within the scope of the current book, along with the finding of new learning methods and new methodological developments and their limitations. This book brings together a collection of inter-/multidisciplinary works applied to many classification and data security applications in a coherent manner",

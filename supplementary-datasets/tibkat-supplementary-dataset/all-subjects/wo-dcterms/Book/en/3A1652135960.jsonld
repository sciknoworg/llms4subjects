            "abstract": "Telecommunications is vital to modern life, and the global telecommunication network that has developed is an essential part of the infrastructure of society. Although there is an extensive literature on many aspects of telecommunication technology, comparatively little has been published on the functioning and planning of complete telecommunication networks. The first edition of this book was intended to help fill that gap and this new edition has been thoroughly revised and includes much new material. The initial chapters describe the structure of local, national and international networks, and cover switching systems, transmission systems, signalling, numbering schemes, routing and call charging. The principles of traffic engineering, mobile networks, ISDN, ATM, intelligent networks, network management, investment appraisal and network planning are also explained. Although the book mainly deals with public telephone networks, there is also a chapter on private networks and data networks. Finally, the principles explained in the earlier chapters are illustrated by several case studies on network planning. The book is intended both to provide the young engineer with a general knowledge of telecommunications and to give the experienced specialist a deeper understanding of his/ her own work against the background of the complete telecommunication network. The book evolved from IEE vacation schools at Aston University, and the chapters are mainly based on teaching contributions made by the authors at these schools",

            "abstract": "\"In the U.S., drivers over the age of 65 now account for nearly 20 percent of licensed drivers. This number will increase to 25% to nearly 70 million by the year 2030. Some of these older drivers may not be capable of operating their vehicles safely in all conditions. The book investigates the key aspects of driving tasks and their relation to the sensory, perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes. Effects on driving performance, including aging, are described with a view toward improving future vehicle and road design as well as driver training and evaluation. This title: - Presents a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of human physical and mental processes to driving behavior. - Showcases recent review and analysis of driver, vehicle, and road environment design factors. - Discusses fundamentals of driving behavior in vehicle control and guidance, collision avoidance, and hazard perception. - Examines the effects of design issues in vehicles, and road environments. - Highlights specific quantifiable attributes of physical and mental functions related to driving approaches. Written for professionals in diverse fields including ergonomics, health and safety, human factors, transportation engineering, and automotive engineering, this book is the essential guide to driving practices and habits. Its appeal will extend to those involved in vehicle design, roadway environments, driver training and regulatory agencies\"--",

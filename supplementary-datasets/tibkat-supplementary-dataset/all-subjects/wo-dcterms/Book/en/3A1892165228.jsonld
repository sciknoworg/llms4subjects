            "abstract": "The Survivor-centered Accessibility Framework Evaluation (SAFE), supported by the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF), comprehensively examines access barriers faced by women and girls in transit who are survivors of GBV across Central America. It focuses on the physical, social, legal, and institutional barriers they face during their displacement journey, and particularly centers on the transit experience, indistinctively of whether this transit is regular, irregular, voluntary, or forced. This report summarizes work conducted over two years and brings to light the multifarious barriers women and girls face in reporting and seeking GBV services in the region. To address these challenges, this work provides targeted interventions and policy recommendations that countries could implement to ensure effective and accessible GBV services for women and girls in transit, and to improve their safety and well-being during their journeys. SAFE provides countries with a regional public good and represents a significant step forward in understanding and addressing human mobility and GBV in Central America. For the first time, it introduces a continuous highly detailed map of migratory and forced displacement routes, offering an unprecedented level of resolution and insight which combines the best of satellite imagery with expert local knowledge. This mapping is part of an ambitious effort to systematize information, enhancing the comprehension of the complexities and dynamics of human mobility in the region. Recognizing human mobility and GBV as regional issues, SAFE underscores the need for regional solutions, involving cross-border collaboration and shared strategies. Importantly, this initiative documents the voices and views of women themselves. By incorporating their perspectives, the study sheds light on unique challenges and experiences faced by women in transit, ensuring that the solutions proposed are more inclusive and responsive to their needs. This work emphasizes collective responsibility and cooperation in addressing issues of human mobility, GBV, and development",
